"bluetooth is great, but when a call, earbuds are better since there is no interruptions of sound.  "
ear buds are comfortable and stay in well.  
sound is good and the slide volume is a good feature since turning the volume up or down
you do not need to touch your phone to do so.
first 48 hours great buy so far!
"sounds good for the price, and comes with a carrying case."
would definitely purchase again.
works perfect.
"no problems, arrived quickly."
my son loves them and i do to
this is a great product
however i bought it to be coupled with my iphone connector.
which does not seem to work as advertised.
will be using it for ipod instead.
the sound is good.
"however, i don't really care for the ear pieces size."
they are kind of large for my earlobe
and i thought there would be smaller/medium sized attached😕
"product work for a while, then the earphones shorted out on me, probably because of the phone or the buds altogether.."
not bad headphonesget
what you pay for
this product is heavy duty and works great!
very dissatisfiedthe earbuds fell apart in no time at all.
one bud the rubber earbud fell off and the other earbud the backside wire protector fell off.
so now the earbuds are useless🤬
work well
really enjoy these earbuds.  
sound is crisp and clear.  
wires are sturdy
loud.
ok but can be better
i've used it for two days and it already stopped working.
ear cups are not easy to insert.  
"inline switch is problimatic, but does work with futzing."
great quality
they broke fairly quickly
didn’t last that long.
one ear stopped playing.
"the left side went out, no longer usable."
works great
they have two different qualities from the same product.
i bought one at the beginning that i was totally satisfied with the quality.
"around a month later, i ordered another one for my brother."
it turned out the new one has a really cheap quality and it doesn't work and have so many issues.
"my brother noticed that even the call answering button was on the left cord, usually it is on the right cord."
so i checked thepanasonic ergofit in-ear earbuds headphones with mic/controller rp-tcm125-w (white) packaging
and it turned out the packaging was different from the first one i got.
even the quality of the packaging was a cheap quality packaging.
"also, same products have different barcode numbers and different model numbers."
the cheap quality has an instruction paper that was in the packaging and most of it was written in chinese.
i'm totally disappointed since i felt that was clearly deception.
i ordered a replacement for the one i got
and i got another one with the same good quality.
that's where i believe that they are cheating on customers.
i purchased a pair of these earphones in december 2017 due to the overwhelming number of positive reviews.
"when they first arrived i was so happy with the sound quality, comfort level in-ear, and their ability to block outside noise."
"i use my headphones for schoolwork or to watch movies on my computer; i am by no means rough with them, i store them carefully, i'd had my last pair for 8 years, etc."
"however, only one month after purchase, the left earphone suddenly shorted out and ceased working."
i attempted to return them through amazon and was instead told to contact panasonic directly.
i tried numerous times to use the panasonic website's live chat support feature but kept getting a message that there were no employees on live chat at this time (no matter what time of day i tried).
i then called their 1-888 support number and the first thing the automated message warned me
was that i risked being charged a $9.99 service fee for help if i continued with the phone call
and if my product turned out not to be covered under warranty.
"given that i didn't know if the earphones were still covered under any limited warranty, i opted to just hang up at that point, write off my money spent, and order a second pair."
"they arrived on january 25, 2018, and again, i was satisfied."
"less than two weeks later, while watching a homework video, the right earphone suddenly shorted out and stopped working."
i called panasonic again figuring
that this time it had to be covered under some warranty at less than 2 weeks old.
the customer service rep sent me the e-mail instructions to submit my proof of purchase for both pairs
and i later received an e-mail back with the instructions for shipping the headphones.
"they stated that i was only allowed to ship the product in one specific type of corrugated cardboard container, that it needed to be  certain size of that container, and that i would need to pay for tracking and insurance on the product on top of the shipping."
the total amount for shipping cost
more than three pairs of these headphones
and they wouldn't guarantee that they would send me two new pairs to replace the two broken ones.
this is the worst experience i've ever had with a purchase from amazon.
"i was disappointed and frustrated that i could not conduct my return directly through amazon and have a replacement sent to me or my money refunded like is usually the case on amazon, but instead had to do the whole runaround with panasonic, and i still don't know whether panasonic will honor its warranty and send me two new pairs."
"based on the number of positive reviews for these earphones it seems like i did just get unlucky (twice) with defective pairs, however, if you're one of those unlucky ones you can count your money spent as lost based on the incredible hassle and lack of good customer service to make it right."
when i first opened these they fit very comfortable in my ears.
when i tried listening to them the sound in the right ear kept shorting out.  
went to amazon to try to return them and learned i could not return them even though i had just purchased them a few days ago.  
instead i was given the phone number to panasonic customer support.  
i was disconnected twice from customer  support while they tried to transfer me to the right person.  
i realize these headphones we’re only $8
but it’s
the principle of it that they make you jump through all of these hoops from the manufacturer to return a defective product.
normally amazon returns items quickly with little effort.  
given all of the positive reviews of these headphones
i am assuming i just got a defective pair.
update:  
i called panasonic to start a return.
they told me i would have to ship the $8 earbuds to them first
then they would fix them and send them back to me.
very disappointed as it would cost me at least that much to ship them in the first place.  
not a fan of panasonic right now and surely will never buy any panasonic headphones again.
"a couple years ago, i ordered five well-rated headphones at once to compare quality over price."
"these were the overall winner, and i've purchased several more over time."
"unfortunately, the latest batch is a completely different product."
either panasonic started skimping on production or these are cheap counterfeits (more likely).
i just plugged these into my electronic drum kit and literally could not hear the kick drum's bass sound at all.
"i thought my kit was messed up, but instead plugged in an older pair of these and noticed not only a clear rolling bass, but all of the sounds were much fuller and richer."
it's a shame that amazon isn't doing anything about counterfeiting.
the positive reviews here are outdated and worthless.
"if you're looking for a testament on durability, reliability, and fit, here's my experience with these earphones."
durability and reliability test - passed.
(four years of daily use and still functioning)been using this since 2012 during the day while i work to listen to music.
these are the only earphones i use that do have not an in-line microphone because it is not needed for my office work.
"this gets rolled and tossed into my bag every weekday, yet.."
"no tears, no loose wires, earpads in tact."
fully functioning.
sound still crisp and clear.
it can definitely stand the mild abuse.
comfort test - passed.
"the fit is perfect for my ears - very ergonomic as the bud rests nicely in the concha (bowl-shaped cavity) of the ear, cradled by the intertragal notch - like a snug hug."
"the earpads insert easily into place for a gentle cushioned feel, loosely 'locking' into place very naturally."
i've worn these for hours at a time without any aching of the ear or hint of tension
so the comfort is definitely there.
"i have also used them while walking, running, cleaning, and they rarely fall out - thank goodness!"
it's so bloody annoying when earbuds slip out!sound test - passed.
let's be real.
don't expect sennheiser quality audio on a earphone that costs less than popcorn at the movie theaters.
but also don't brush it off either.
the sound quality is rather good.
"to the average user, one most likely won't pick up the nuiances between amazing full bass, mid, or treble."
"these are definitely not bass-enhanced so don't expect these to pump out your favorite bass-powered beats to your liking, but they will do an acceptable job at nice highs and clear mids."
"general notes:because of the fit of the earpad into the ear canal, it does block out some noise."
"because i do use these for work, i normally just keep one of these earbuds in for the music while still being attentive within the environment."
"these earphones also do a decent job at keeping the audio 'localized', meaning if you are jamming music at full blast, the sound will leak from the earphones, but not too much."
i can be listening to music at a somewhat loud scale and no one around me can hear it at all.
comfort/fit comparison:i am an android user and faithful samsung galaxy series smart phone user.
i have the old samsung galaxy s2 earphones and the new samsung galaxy s6 edge earphones to compare comfort/ergo fit to.
you'll see in my picture the stark difference in overall shape of the earbud from just three earphones.
"yet despite my loyalty to samsung galaxy smartphones, the fit of their earphones are always terrible, even the latest s6 edge earphone accessory."
here is why the fit and comfort of the humble panasonic make my ears happier than most earpieces:- see samsung galaxy s2 earphones.
nice soft silicone gel earpad but poor earbud shape that doesn't 'lock' into place with the natural shape of the outer ear.
"thus, it frequently comes out like a loose, thick q-tip.- see samsung galaxy s6 edge earphones."
"better quality silicone gel earpad that attempts to cushion the supposed natural shape of the ear canal entrance, but utterly fails for anyone with normal sized ears."
"even with the smallest size gel earpads, the earphones frequently pop out and is very annoying."
"not only that, the gel earpads frequently loosen from the buds itself and falls off."
i got my s6
edge summer of 2015
and i have already used all spare gel earpads + another set of replacement earpads
"(if you look closely at the photo, i had to resort to a left earpad for my right earbud because i had no more replacement earpads to use)."
i am now down to a single earpad and am giving up on these stupid earphones in general.
verdict:worth!
four years on a product that works on a daily and fits great for price of $6-$10?
no brainer.
incredibly reliable and good quality.
i've had a love/hate relationship with these earbuds until i learned how to properly use them
(i've had them for a few weeks now).
"these are my first pair of in-ear earbuds and as many have already said, they are to be worn sealed into the ear canal to get the proper fidelity."
you cannot simply fit them into the opening of the ear and get any bass response at all.
i knew this but didn't know how you were supposed to get them inserted properly
and i struggled in the absence of any pertinent guidance.
i understand that everyone's ears are shaped a little differently but what i found that worked for me was to insert the bud into the opening of my ear canal and rotate it while applying inward pressure (kind of like turning a screw) until the cable/shaft points upwards
(see my pic).
when the bud is situated this way it slides into my ear canal and makes the appropriate seal
and i can run the cable behind my ear.
no amount of inward pressure could get the proper seal with the cables hanging downward like you would think it is intended.  
it took me a while to figure this out.
i also discovered that there is a fine line between pushing it in just enough to create the seal and pushing it in too far.
go too far and they begin to hurt rather quickly...
and they hurt pretty bad.
so find the spot where they seal but go no further.
"again, it took me a while to figure this out."
when positioned correctly i can wear them for extended periods.
"that being said, once fitted correctly - sealed in the ear canal - these buds provide an adequate (quite a bit actually) amount of bass and sound isolation compared to the regular headphones that simply rest in front of the ear opening."
the bass was too much at first.
i realized i had my eq settings on my device set to a high bass boost to compensate for my old headphones.
once adjusted to flatten out the bass they sounded fantastic.
i've never had any other high-end earbuds to compare these to
but i feel that these sound great especially for the price.
they do a very good job of keeping out surrounding noise.
i used them on a recent flight and they did a much better job keeping out the background noise of the jet than my old phones.
use caution when walking/running as they can block the sound of traffic and other hazards you would otherwise hear.
summary:
these panasonic in-ear earbuds are a great value and have exceptional sound... once you learn how to properly use them.
experiment to achieve the correct and comfortable fit.
i have purchased 3 pairs of these headphones - the first without a microphone and then two more with a microphone.
the non-microphone pair was really great - i used it for years before it finally gave out.
the microphone version seemed just as great
"and i loved being able to use them to make calls, pause and start my music, etc."
"however, after about a year the plastic piece covering the speaker loosened and detached."
i bought another pair and it only lasted a few months before the exact same thing happened.
i think they must be using less glue or something because the microphone ones are much less sturdy.
even though my second pair was still under warranty (i only bought it 2.5 months ago)
"panasonic refused to replace them because they were ""damaged""."
panasonic -
the damage is because of your faulty design!
"i am at work, next to the window, and there is a literal jackhammer outside the window."
"i have these headphones in, listening to music, and i can't hear it at all."
"if you want that in your life, these are the earbuds for you."
they've changed the style of these.
the previous style was fantastic.
"i tend to go through headphones due to a lot of abuse, but the sound was fantastic and had great bass and great at blocking out other noise."
ordered another set of 4 of these (again because i'm hard on headphones) and now the style has changed.
"thinner wire, less base, doesn't block out noise as well."
i fail to understand why when people have a winning product that they feel the urge to redesign the product and make it worse.
i guess it's to save money.
well they need to save their money because i'm certainly not spending any more of my money on these.
"excellent sound quality, affordable, comfortablethe"
"only downside is the pictures do not indicate the jack has a square-end cover, which prevents usage in some types of cases."

they sound better than some of the $20+ sony headphones!

hit the helpful button if you find it
helpfullet's break it
downi found myself searching an earphone that exceeds my previous cheap earphones which cost around $6
then i found this
and here is what i expereince.1.
priceby
"the the time i purchased it, which was april, i bought it at $9.75, and since i am in outside the us, on a teritory, shipping fee is a norm when buying."
suprisingly it is free shipping.
"from the $6 amount to $9.75, it is worth the jump, and wish to buy it while it is still cheap.2.audio qualityif"
"you are looking for a clear, low bass, and stable sound for the ears"
then this is the one for you.
just need to find the right volume from your phone and its all good.3.
"fit, comfortability and"
"durabilityhave you ever seen the earphone of s8, that is like the design of this one but a little smaller."
fits the ear perfectly fine.
"the item is light, the cord is flexible but not tangle proof."
it is not actually sound proof unless you boost the volume near its max.

downi found myself searching an earphone that exceeds my previous cheap earphones which cost around $6
then i found this
and here is what i expereince.1.

"the the time i purchased it, which was april, i bought it at $9.75, and since i am in outside the us, on a teritory, shipping fee is a norm when buying."
suprisingly it is free shipping.
"from the $6 amount to $9.75, it is worth the jump, and wish to buy it while it is still cheap.2.audio qualityif"
"you are looking for a clear, low bass, and stable sound for the ears"
then this is the one for you.
just need to find the right volume from your phone and its all good.3.
"fit, comfortability and"
"durabilityhave you ever seen the earphone of s8, that is like the design of this one but a little smaller."
fits the ear perfectly fine.
"the item is light, the cord is flexible but not tangle proof."
it is not actually sound proof unless you boost the volume near its max.

these headphones are awful.
i arrived them broken yesterday with one headphone not playing sound.
"because of the return policy, i can not return them."
the headphone that does work sounds like it's underwater.
i purchased these headphones approximately 1 1/2 years ago and they still work.
"when i originally bought them i needed them as all-purpose headphones which i could bring to school, use in the weight room, and use while doing work around the house."
for a large portion of the time i've had them
"that's exactly what i've used them for, and they've worked like a charm."
"it is important to note, however, that these headphones are all-plastic, so they will take some abuse but will get damaged if the situation gets too rough."
"(i'll touch on that a bit more later).for the price, the sound quality of these in-ears is fantastic."
"when i let a friend use them once, he immediately responded with ""whoa."""
for $10 earbuds
the sound is very impressive and probably suitable for most people.
"these headphones have a balanced sound with enough clarity to deliver the basic framework of whatever music you're listening to, plus a little bit more."
"if you're mostly a passive listener and want cheap earbuds you won't have to worry about if they get lost or stolen, these are a great buy."
"when i eventually upgraded to more expensive earbuds, these ones were able still to hold a candle to the competition, although with further comparison the panasonic's are slightly ""blattier"" and ""fuzzier"" than higher-quality, more expensive options."
"on their own, though, these earbuds sound significantly better than others in their price range, even rivaling some costing"
around $25.i used these earbuds as my primary listening medium for about nine months
and they withstood a lot of abuse.
"every day i would take them to school, usually stuffing them in the smaller pocket of my backpack and carrying them wherever i went."
"for a long time, they stood strong."
"however,  i pulled the buds out of my ears one day and the right side wasn't all together."
"in fact, the right speaker had split off from the rest of the earbud's housing."
"however, the wire to the speaker was still intact and after i gently snapped the two pieces back together, both earbuds worked just the same."
"unfortunately, i was long passed the ninety (90) day warranty for the headphones and there was nothing i could do to have them fixed."
"from then on, i have had to be careful when pulling the right bud from my ear, but besides that, nothing else has broken."
"now, these earbuds have long been replaced by more expensive ones with higher sound quality."
"currently, i use them as my main running earbuds:  "
"these headphones are good enough to get me in the groove, but i wouldn't be too upset if they broke."
"so far, they have managed fairly well despite their earlier injuries and despite being sweated on a great deal."
they still work just fine and sound exactly how they did when i first got them.
pros:-cheap-sound great for the price-reasonably durable-ergo fit (fits very well in your ears & helps you figure out which side is which)cons:-90 day warranty-plastic housing-thin shielding on the main cordthe panasonic's
also come with a mic and a pause/play button on the cord.
"it's also important to mention that these headphones are in-ears and fit pretty snugly in your ear, which i think helps block out sound and helps to keep the bud in place."
for some people this could be uncomfortable and be a big negative for them.
"overall, the panasonic rptcm125's are great-sounding headphones for the price, which you can take around with you almost anywhere."
"they will withstand a lot of abuse but, sadly, are only covered under warranty for the first three months."
recommended for the listener who wants a pair of powerful headphones for cheap.
update 7/10/2015:
changed my rating to better match my experience with the product.
might as well be disposable.
great sound and comfortable for a couple of weeks until they break.
"great design but cheap, cheap, cheap manufacturing."
might be a good product if anyone else made them.  
i bought two and on one pair
an earbud just completely fell apart and the plastic glue lines just wires holding the speaker on within two weeks.
"in another two weeks the other pair had just one speaker completely go out,"
"no reason, no damage, just no sound... don't waste your money spend the extra $10 and get a decently made product."
i have a self appointed mission of finding inexpensive headphones that sound better than average.
i have been on this quest for years as i am always never without my mp3 player or radio.  
i am rough on headphones and go through them fairly regularly.  
so i am always trying to find inexpensive headphones that sound better than my previous set (skullcandy ink'd).  
"this time, after carefully reading reviews, i purchased 3 different headphones at once, all in the same price range (under $15.00):"
"the panasonic rp-hje120-a (blue), the skullcandy jib, and the 2xl spoke ("
"bounty hunter collection).my conclusions were that the 2xl spoke were adequate, but a distant third place."
"while the 2xl had definitively better bass than the skullcandy ink'd,"
the 2xl's mids and highs were only adequate.  
"the skullcandy jib completely blew the scullcandy ink'd away, with much better bass, mids and highs"
", i thought i found what i had been looking for, that my quest had ended.  "
but there was still the panasonic rp-hje120 to listen to.  
i must say i had little expectation for these after listening to the skullcandy jib's.  
but what was this?  
immediately the panasonic's sounded impressive.  
"after listening to them for a while, i listened to the jib's again.  "
"i honestly preferred the cleaner sound of the panasonic rp-hje120, and the ergo design was a plus, the fit was just so comfortable."
so there you have my layman's evaluation of these three headsets and my hands down recommendation for the panasonic rp-hje120
"(i got the blue, however, i very much doubt that your color choice will affect the sound).i hope this helped."
"first off, i'm old, like great-grandpa-old ."
"over the years, i have preferred closed-back sennheiser headphones as open-backs annoy my wife if she's watching tv while i'm listening to music or an audiobook in the same room and buds won't stay in my ears."
"the only time i use earbuds is when i'm working outside, mowing the lawn, etc."
"and i always had to wear shooter muffs over them, not only to reduce the noise, but to keep the stupid earbuds from falling-out of my ears while i worked."
i like these angled buds.
"upon putting these earbuds in and plugging them into an early ipod nano, the first thing i noticed was that they didn't fall out of my ears every time i moved and my wife can't hear them when i'm sitting on the other side of the sofa."
i also tested them mowing the lawn and trimming hedges without shooter muffs and they stayed in and sounded great.
"i can't speak to audiophiles about range, and whatever, as i have some high & low range hearing loss, but i will say that when listening to mp3s on my ipod from brubeck, to billie holiday to irish punk and an audiobook of the count of monte cristo, they all sounded great."
i even jacked them into my pc speaker for a few minutes of oblivion.
"so far, i am very happy with this purchase."
no good - one side broke within 1st week of use.
panasonic pulled this product off the market . . .
and per chat with a panasonic agent this morning . . .
they have totally discontinued making these headphones.
but - you are welcome to return it to them at a warranty handling cost that is equal to the cost of buying
a new one . .
.
oh yes . . .
we get to pay them twice for replacing their defective headphones.
good-bye forever panasonic!  
just one more example of too big to fail.
wishing you as much continued success as you deserve for your non-handling of an obviously defective product.
cons:1.
the cord is not silicone wire.
it tangles easily.2.
right angle mini-plug puts excess stress on the wire.
i expect it to fail.
"with straight mini plugs, i can install a piece of shrink tubing over the plug to provide increased stress relief where the wire goes into the plug."
can't fit shrink tubing onto a right angle plug.3.
size is a bit too large for comfortable sleeping.
i use earbuds specifically to help me get to sleep by putting a droning podcast on at very low volume.
out like a light in a few minutes.
the earbuds also act like earmuffs to mute room noise.
these panasonic buds are just a bit too long and are uncomfortable in the ear that's against the pillow.4.
audio quality is so-so but adequate for voice.5.
expensive for what they are.
can find four sets for less $$ elsewhere.
pros:1.
the buds are angled such that you can see in daylight and feel in the dark which one is left and which is right.
"after they break, i won't be buying them again."
i'm very disappointed in how quickly these break.
"they used to be my go-to headphones for casual use, decent sound"
and you didn't care too much if something happened to them.
i would buy a new pair every year or so.
"but the last 3 times i bought them, they stopped working within a month."
at this point i have to assume it's not just bad luck.
and they aren't as durable as they used to be.
"this is a real shame because i like how they fit, i can wear them for hours without making my ears uncomfortable."
unfortunately i'll have to find a new brand.
i can't keep throwing money away.

tl/dr below****updated review below**i just have to say wow
", i had to spread the word on these guys."
i am super impressed with these earbuds.
"if you told me that i could have a pair of earbuds that sounded great, did not distort any sound, were comfortable, looked decent, and they were only 8 dollars, i would slap you and call you a liar!!"
"i would be severely mistaken however (and arrested), as i am dead wrong."
i had read reviews on a couple of different websites that these were the el dorado of earbuds under 50 dollars.
some were so brave as to exclaim that these were the best earbuds under 100 dollars.
"i then found 33,000 reviews on amazon with the overwhelming majority saying that these are the best cheap earbud to get."
"these brash claims caught my attention, and as a gadget guru and headphone enthusiast, i had no choice but"
to succumb to the lavish price of 8 dollars.
"for those interested in a breakdown: these come with three sets of eartips, which i had to play with because i could not find the right size at first."
"making sure you have the right size ear tips in is crucial, because it will form a seal around your ear and you will be able to isolate and block external noise better, hear the music louder and clearer, and the bass will be more prominent."
i have had these for a week so far and have used them for a multitude of things.
"i’ve watched movies, listened to music while mowing the lawn"
"(these were sufficient at for drowning out most noise), worked out with them, and used them for playing games."
the best things i would recommend them for are for just casually listening to music and watching movies.
"this is my general test on how good headphones are: play rage against the machine and see if i can get pumped up on the bass, then play i saw her standing there by the beatles and see if i can hear george harrison twanging away on his guitar over paul mccartney’s overpowering bass."
these definitely beat a lot of over the ear headphones that i own.
the sound is balanced and i could hear everything almost exactly like the original audio recording.  
they also had a reasonable audio level and got as loud as i needed them before i hit the highest setting.
"i would not recommend these for working out, as they just kept falling out of my ears and distracting me while i was running."
"i also would say that these are not an acceptable headphone for fps or multiplayer gaming, as you really need an over the ear set to amp up all the noise in the game and help give you directional listening."
i could not pinpoint footsteps / etc.
with these earbuds as well as with my audio technica and polk headsets.
"also, you need a decent mic for voice chat and this model does not have a mic."
"generally though, these are worth it for everything else mentioned."
"so, here i am."
telling you to get these.
get them now.
don’t hesitate.**tl/dr:
"8 dollar headphones,"
why you not buy?****product

* 5 stars dropped to 3what
am i doing up at 1247am on a sunday?
"one may answer that i am at a club having a great time, or watching a movie with my fiance, or having a sleepover with my family, but the answer to that question is none of the above."
"i am awake at this hour as your sworn headphone avenger, to tell you not to buy these headphones."
you should buy these headphones instead: jvc hafx5b gumy plus inner ear headphones -blackwhy?
because i was a bit over zealous on my initial review.
"at the time of writing the original review, i had not found a suitable alternative for a cheap and reasonably decent sounding pair of headphones."
"but - just like all politicians, at some point when you make a public statement you have to back track when you're mouth was moving faster than your brain."
i bought the jvc gumy headphones from best buy a few weeks ago and i was intending to test them side by side with the panasonic ergofits.
i noticed some immediate improvements that the jvcs had over the panasonics.
one was that the gummy seals for your ear are a lot more comfortable.
"secure, and provide a much better seal than the panasonics did."
the next improvement was the mic and control button(which
"the upgraded ergofit has, but you shouldn't go without it)."
the most important feature that the jvcs have over the panasonic is its performance.
"when i listened to one more time by daft punk on both headphones, the panasonics were very level all around and there was nothing spectacular that stood out."
"when i used the jvcs, my ears exploded with delight from the much better bass response it had."
i have been using the jvcs for everything since then
and i haven't looked back.
"great microphone, great audio, and right-angle jack makes phone more pocket-friendly."
i have bought sooo many (official/approved)
"apple earpods, and they all break."
"mostly because when i put my phone in my front pocket and then sit down, the cable juts out from the phone in a straight line, and eventually it wears out, so that signal starts cutting out to one of the ears, or the microphone fails."
"and i've tried to buy knock-offs, and those sound terrible, or their mics are awful."
"today, i received this panasonic ergofit."
i've tested the sound and the microphone.
both are excellent (for this price).
"and, best of all, the right-angled jack means that now my phone will sit easier in my pocket, and the cable will be less likely to get damaged."
i'm hoping these last a long time.
"if you're looking for an affordable set of ear-buds that sound good, have a good microphone for calls/dictation, and a right-angle jack, i heartily recommend this.  "
and i'm someone who *rarely* writes reviews._______update !
"i love these earbuds so much, i keep buying them when i lose my last pair.  "
i forgot
"i wrote this review, then i wrote another review, but amazon wouldn't let me post it because this review already exists."
"anyhow, this is what i wrote today may 21st 2019 :"

_i used to think apple earbuds were the best until i tried these.
"these sound incredible, and the microphone sounds great to whoever is calling you."
the rubber fittings on the earbuds feel great and block out just the right amount of ambient noise.
they're so comfortable.
"i'm a professional musician & producer, and i've been so disgusted by other earbuds terrible speakers -- often way too sibilant, or distorted.  "
i fear they inflict ear damage.  
not these.
these sound well balanced across the eq spectrum.
my only complaint is with myself : i keep losing earbuds.
i've literally bought these 4 times.  
"for christmas and birthdays sometimes family gives me earbuds, but those always sound terrible, and i keep coming back to this pair."
"for example, my mom bought me apple earbuds for christmas, assuming i'd prefer them."
but then i did a test.
"i called her from the other side of the house, and i switched the earbuds back and forth between the panasonic and the apple, and asked her which one sounded better when i was speaking through the microphone.  "
she chose these ones!  
even though they're much more affordable!  
she was shocked.
"i'm not loyal to any brands, but,"
"wow, panasonic really got this one right."
thank you.  
"seriously, the market is flooded with terrible sounding earbuds, and it's really hard to find one that:- earbuds"
sound
great-
microphone sounds great-
comfortable- affordablei give these my highest recommendation.
enjoy!
let me start by saying that i have always had trouble finding ear buds that fit my ears and actually stay in.
"in fact, i can honestly say never have i had a pair i've liked and used for more than a few days.it's been frustrating and strange too..."
why dont any ear buds work for me?
everywhere you go
it seems so many people have  one earbud hanging out there ear
all easy breezy
like it's no big thing.
"i mean, are my ears shaped weird?"
do i not understand how to insert an earbud?
is it really that complicated?  
"then i thought it was because my ears were small but even if i used the smallest size cover, it never stayed in."
i kinda just gave up and moved on to head phones
"but they can be bulky and heavy, which is a whole other story...."
i tried expensive ones too thinking maybe i was getting shoddy products being too economical....
"anyhow, i wasn't expecting much from these based on my past experiences with all the others.so, you can imagine how very happily stunned i was when i opened these and saw the very differently positioned ear"
bud.
i was immediately hopeful.
"then, when i inserted into my ear i could feel the instant comfort and ""click"", if you will."
it just fit so well!
i think i audibly gasped in shock and awe.
"maybe this sounds a bit dramatic but it has been at least a decade of trying out many, many different earbuds,"
"so hopefully, you can understand my joy."
i have not gone to the gym yet with them so once i do i may report back on how it went.
but i've used them in my car and was able to hear perfect and command my phone and took a phone call to which the person on the other end said it sounded loud and clear with not a lot of background noise.  
"suffice it to say, so far i am quite happy with these and will absolutely buy more pairs."
"i've been through a bunch of earbuds in the $10 to $50 range, and these have by far the best sound quality of any of them."
they're not audiophile 'phones any means.
"they don't have much treble extension, or ""air,"" and the bass is a bit indistinct (but warm and reasonably full, without being exaggerated, like in all the horrible bose and beats consumer products)."
"but anyway, i get these for running and for the gym, where they will be thrashed and sweated on and broken, or possibly just lost."
so the price is right.
my only gripe is that they're fragile.
"for the sound quality, and a bit more durability, i'd happily pay twice as much."
which is why i now buy two pairs at a time.
"which is an ok solution, but wasteful."
"and yes, i've looked at buds that cost twice or three times as much ..."
they look equally flimsy.
why all the one-star reviews?
probably inconsistent quality control.
which is not surprising at the price point.
i've just been lucky so far.
"if you get these and they sound bad out of the box, or if they break right away, you got a lemon."
send back and maybe give them a 2nd chance.
here's a tip if you're using these for running or the gym: get the ones without the mic.
the mic/volume button assembly isn't even a little bit water resistant.
"as soon as you sweat on it, your music will start skipping and going crazy, like your phone's taken over by a poltergeist."
i've fixed by covering the mic/buttons with duct tape.
"for the next pair i was going to fix with shrink tubing, but then saw they make (for even cheaper!)"
a mic-free version.
these are a very inexpensive replacement for headphone/mic combos that come with a mobile phone.  
my primary function for these is gaming on the xbox.  
no echo with the mic (unless accidentally blasting sound through the tv)
and the volume is perfect.  
bass and treble are average per cheaper cellphone headphones.  
"i recently purchased the hyperx cloud pro gaming headset due to in-ear bud discomfort, and there wasn't a very large difference in sound quality.  "
"the hyperx is definitely more crisp with regards to the tone and carries about the same in bass, but other than that.... not much better overall.  "
for ten times less i'd recommend the panasonic over more expensive over-the-ear headphone/mic combos.  
my only gripe is the discomfort of in-ear buds over a long duration of use.  
"it must be noted that the shape of the bud is oval, not round.  "
"i don't believe this makes a large difference in comfort for me, but it may for you."
"if you want high quality sound from headphones i recommend doing some serious research (if you're reading this, you're already on the path.)  "
i wanted a quick fix to my previous cable-ripped headphone/mic combo and went with the panasonic.  
best headphone decision made in a while.
i needed some quick earbuds for reasons.
mic?
bonus.
"these work well for the intended use (movies, ignoring people, etc)."
i tend to fall asleep while wearing them.
"soooo, i fell asleep with these earbuds last night (watching lucifer, amazing show)."
i woke up in the middle of the night with the urgent need to pee.
i could barely open my eyes
", i was so exhausted, and didn't realize i had my earbuds until one side fell out, halfway to the bathroom."
"i tucked the 'buds into my shirt, the cord hanging down."
i entered the bathroom and sat down on my throne.
"after a moment, i looked down and saw that the earbuds had decided to take a swim."
no!
i could not go a day without my earbuds!
i just couldn't do it!
"i know you don't know my situation, but if you did, you would understand that i. need."
these.
earbuds.i took them back to my bed and cleaned them.
"i know, gross, but i'm in a desperate situation here!"
i put each bud on an end of a q-tip.
i went back to sleep.
it is now the next morning.
"my heart pounding, i plugged the earbuds into my phone and pressed play on a youtube video a friend made for me (""bodies"" by drowning pool music video, search ""duckduckgames amv redemption"" to see his).the earbuds still work."
tl;dr:pros
: work well for streaming netflix.
cons: do not prevent people from talking to me.
"tip: these are not sh*t, don't put them in the toilet."
recommend: absolutely!
if you've been wondering how such a highly-rated product like this can also have
"one-star reviews stating these earbuds have ""absolutely no bass whatsoever"" and sound ""horribly tinny"", i'd like to offer an explanation."
these panasonics are not designed to be placed in the ears and worn like classic earbuds.  
"if that's how you wear them, you'll get nothing but tinny sound at relatively low volume (think 1960's pocket transistor radio.)"
"these earbuds are specifically designed to fit snugly into the ear, forming an airtight seal.  "
"if you choose too small of an earpad and/or don't push them in far enough, you won't hear any low-end frequencies."
it's only when you get an airtight seal that the earbuds will instantly come alive with full-range sound and volume.
here's a quick analogy:
"tightly plug both ears with your fingers, close your mouth, and hum the lowest note you can.  "
"now take your fingers away, and notice how almost all of the low end and volume drops out.  "
that's the difference between a proper fit and an improper fit with these earbuds.  
"although the acoustic principles are different, these earbuds must literally plug your ears in order to give you the full frequency spectrum.  "
otherwise they'll sound horrendous.
"unfortunately, panasonic wasn't very forthcoming on their product's packaging about how to wear the earbuds, and i'm certain some unwitting consumers are throwing away perfectly good pairs."
"as an audio engineer, i can assure you these earbuds, when properly fitted, sound great.  "
"they're not audiophile-quality earbuds with the sonic transparency of a $200 pair of studio-reference headphones, and they're not as ergonomic as a $150 pair of westones, but for the price, they are an exceptionally fantastic bargain -- arguably one of the best product bargains i've ever run across on amazon.  "
do they have a lot of bass?  
"they're not deficient in any of the low frequencies, but they're not bass-enhanced earbuds, either, which some of you may be used to.  "
"they have a relatively nice, flat bass response as is, but if you want extra bottom end on your music, you'll want to boost the low end of your mp3 player's eq.  "
"fortunately, boosted lows, even the deepest of lows, are handled very well by these panasonics."
"as a result of how these earbuds are designed to be worn, they could be uncomfortable for some people to wear for extended periods of time.  "
"the earpads are very soft and pliable, though, and i personally don't experience any discomfort wearing them.  "
"since these earbuds are designed to be wedged into your ear, there are two unique, negative issues to point out:1."
"be very careful not to drop your mp3 player, because having earbuds ripped out of your ear canal is not a pleasant experience.2."
these earbuds may amplify the sound of your heartbeat when it's racing during an intense workout.  
"the incessant ""tick tick tick"" is loud enough that it becomes extremely annoying during quiet passages in the music you're listening to."
"in summary, the audio quality of these earbuds, when properly fitted, will satisfy 99.9% of the general population.  "
"i would not recommend them for bike riding or street running since they block out ambient noise, but if you need some quality earbuds to tune out the world for a while, these panasonics are an excellent choice and a phenomenal value."

received my order yesterday.
greatly dissappointed with  the dismally poor quality of this product.
the ear bud wires are dangerously thin.
the advertised 3.5mm jacks are off spec.
- way to small to fit the amazon kindle fire tablet hd87th
gen.  
or  the lg l62vl smartphone both of proven 3.5mm device ports.
"at this point, i can only wonder if these advertised ""panasonic"" products are  cheap counterfeit versions of the real ones that +/-"

"customers reviewed , which found their way into the amazon inventory.  "
in any case avoid thisproduct until quality control personnel at both amazon and panasonic redressthis matter.
i have waited a few weeks to make sure that these panasonic in-ear stereo earbuds are still working well.
when i first received them i think the packaging caused them to be kinked up
"and i had several issues on the first three days with the sound automatically getting louder, static sounding in one ear only, and/or the sound going to zero without my touching it at all."
i was happy i had purchased the square trade as i thought i would be returning it.
"however, i am glad i waited and took my time because i am no longer having any issues with this product."
i do have one thing i want to point out that the wires on the ear buds are quite thin and for some reason the connection point is l-shaped.
this can cause you to have the ear buds over the volume control on your fire tablet.
i would prefer stronger wires and a straight connection.
what i really like about this is the fact that the ear buds are ergonomic and fit in your ear quite well.
i like to use mine to fall asleep to at night without waking my husband.
these are very comfortable and i like that!you can purchase these in various colors
but i like the basic black which i got.
"i do recommend you purchase the square trade for less than a dollar, because if you are anything like me, you really give them a workout."
"i use mine mostly when sleeping, so it is out of my control on how i treat them."
i like everything about these buds but their durability.
they simply do not last.
"i suppose if i simply sat still in a comfy chair, the wires would never sway, the connections would never be challenged, and the durability might be eternal."
"but the wires are a very thin gauge, the connections (especially to the angled jack) vulnerable, and even if you never catch a wire on a doorknob or counter corner - and"
"i took special care not to - these earbuds will fail, apparently from the simple natural swaying motion of walking or jogging, within months."
"this my third failure, this last one having been comped to me by panasonic after the failure of its predecessor, and three strikes you're out."
"years ago i bought a straight-up no frills version of these ergos - no mic, no pause - and"
"today that's what i'm using, until i  decide on a replacement."
"is the newer version made of cheaper materials, or with lousy quality control?"
take your pick.
the old ones are still functional.
the new ones have all failed within 6 weeks.
i wish it were not so.
"love the fit, can wear them to sleep, love a mic and a pause, and the price is brilliant."
that's probably the issue.
"i'd happily pay double for a more durable product, but i generally buy less expensive buds because, well, they fail."
keep on truckin'...
"postscript, 1 december 2019:"
"as the panasonics are the only earbuds i've used that have both decent fidelity and a structure sufficiently small to sleep on, i still buy them."
and treat them tenderly.
"about a month ago, i bought the pretty blue option, which is two dollars cheaper than the $13 standard black."
they perform beautifully and differentiate by sight from my other black and white earbud sets.
but i never go walkabout with them: they're my sleepbuds...and good for that if i'm not rollin' and a-tumblin' all the whole night long...
"i've purchased these headphones three times, always have solid sound quality and fit comfortably in my ears."
"however, was very disappointed this product arrived damaged in the packaging"
"(plastic wire covering defective, leaving part of the wires exposed)."
would have just filed a return but received an error saying this product cannot be returned.
"super frustrating that i'm now stuck with a defective product and no way to get my money back.*****update, i checked further and sent a ""get product support"" message to see if there's an alternative way to get the product returned."
"filled out a quick message, the next page simply includes the manufacturing contact info (1-800 support number) and a link to panasonic's own website."
"amazon's own link for ""more assistance"" at the bottom of the page is broken and just shows some code for a relative link, totally unusable."
just know if you get a defective item
you're stuck!
update -
"while i remain positive on these very inexpensive ear buds, and they are still performing, i treat them as being fragile."
the wires for instance are pretty light weight.  
"again for the money, i consider them a good buy.------for under $9.00"
these panasonic ergofit in-ear earbud headphones were a great buy.
"i have several sets of ear buds, from these $8 ones, to a range of $40 to $100."
"while i am not sophisticated enough to compare the specs or sound quality of high end ear buds, for $8 i was not expecting these to sound as good as they do."
"i sleep with a set of small ear buds every night, and use several amazon sleeping apps and albums."
i want to go to sleep quickly and to stay asleep.
"smaller ear buds enable me to sleep on my side, using a pillow, without being conscious of them."
i also don't want to wake up with irritated ear canals.
"if i break an inexpensive set, i would just pick up another."
"right now i am using a $40 set, and i don’t want to toss or turn and break a $40 set."
they are just a little too big for me use on a nightly basis.
others may find these are fine to sleep with.
"i do use them throughout the week, depending on what i am listening to, or deepening on what i shove in my pocket."
"my daily range of music includes smooth jazz, classical, blues, country, rock, indie and pop."
"if i want a higher quality sound, i reach for a higher quality"
ear bud.
in general these are acceptable.
again they are only $8.there
"are reviews with differing opinions on whether or not they are noise canceling and other commenting about challenges to get them seated, to have them be noise canceling."
i have been fortunate enough to just be able to pop them in place
and they do cancel out general noise distractions.
"again, for $8, i would not have to think twice to buy another set, to keep them handy and to use when i inevitably misplace any one, or several sets of earbuds at the same time."
consider splurging!
i bought these just because of the hype surrounding them.
i own several pairs of headphones and earphones.
"when i first put these on and listened, i was unimpressed."
"but i misjudged them, because after comparing them back to back with my sony mdrxb40ap, i found that the treble on the sony was actually a bit too much, almost harsh, because when i put the panasonic back on, listening to the treble was like my ears were on soft comfy pillows."
"the mid range was more present on the panasonic than on the sony, and the bass was good, however the sony beat the panasonic in that category."
"but honestly, it should, since the sony was about 6x more expensive, and it is literally called ""extra bass."
""""
"the clarity and definition was also better on the sony, but again, i would expect it to be for the price."
"all in all, the sound you're getting is nothing to sneeze at, and for about $6-$7, you really can't get a better deal."
these are worth it for the unique driver chamber and nozzle design alone.
they really are an ergonomic fit.
"so, if you really don't have money to spend, get these."
"and even if you have better earphones, but just wanna compare, these are a fun buy."
and they come in great colors!
i'm glad i got mine in red.
"i would've gotten blue, but blue is just so... not red, y'know?"
"these are the best earbuds, period."
i had a pair for years with no problems
"but i lost them, which caused me much emotional turmoil."
"bought a new pair but upgraded to the ones with the mic, which is a game changer."
i can now browse adult content on my computer and use both my hands while talking to customer service reps from spectrum.
"the earbuds run a little small, so i use the biggest size on my average size ears."
"they fit pretty snugly, but still could be a little bigger."
the sound is fantastic for the $10 price tag.
i actually got rid of my beats by dre and use these instead.
they don't cancel out all sound
but they drown out a good amount.
"with a little audio eq, the sound is crisp, with good mids, highs, and bass."
"the cord is a little flimsy, but the first pair lasted so damn long that i have faith in it."
i actually bought these for my mom for christmas and told her they cost $100 because i'm a bad son
and she believed me
and she loves them too.
i purchased this on november 4th and it already stopped functioning; the month isn't even over yet.
"it worked fine for 1 week, then shoddy audio started happening."
then 1 side stopped working.
"i bought this after reading some rave reviews about the ""bang for the buck"" and how quality hadn't been compromised despite being budget friendly."
i feel duped.
"the version i bought was without the mic, so i don't know if there's a quality difference between the w/mic and w/o mic versions."
"in any case, there shouldn't be."
don't offer these products if you can't assure quality.
i keep reading how these have held up well and are good for 'kids' -
"but we've gone through three pairs - two in the past 3 months alone, so they clearly do not hold up for us.  "
"my daughter uses these in school for spanish labs, and mostly at home to listen to music and video.  "
"at home they are left 'around' and in school they are placed within her padded chromebook case, so not the most abused ear buds.  "
"i'm getting a little tired of ordering new ones, so despite the advice in other reviews to 'buy in bulk' -"
i may just buy another brand and see if they last longer.
"bass-challenged, with pronounced sibilance.  "
maybe i should give three stars since they are so cheap but decided two stars since they are so cheap.  
i can live with the bass
"somewhat lean (omission rather than commission) but the sibilance robs hfs, like cymbals, of their natural timbre, leaving a spitty ssssssssss  sssssssssss  sssssssssss noise.  "
i admit i'm spoiled by my full-sized around-the-ear planar magnetic cans.  
"good buy for the kids, or to use when you don't want to risk your good buds.  "
just fine for talk radio or baseball fans.
someone suggested reports of poor bass may be due to user failure to insert them properly.  
"sorry, no, tonal balance is simply very light.  "
some listeners may mistake sibilance for good detail - just depends to what one is accustomed.  
"they work, you can hear music with them and they're seven bucks at this time, the latter being their strong point.  "
"however, they aren't the worst i've heard, just the most affordable.  "
be forgiving
and they'll sound okay.
(see my update)if
you have a tin ear
these might please you.
tinny doesn't even begin to describe their sound..
the crappiest headphones i have ever purchased.
i read a review on cnet that these were great and had great bass sound.
nothing could be farther from the truth.
they sound like music in a tin can.
extremely bright treble crashes on your ear drums like clattering silverware on a marble floor.
using the eq doesn't help much at all.
don't buy these unless you have no ear for quality sound and hate anything non treble.
update:
i have found that using the largest silicone cushions greatly enhances the quality of sound.
so i have upgraded from one star to five.
"the bass came forward way, way more when i used the larger cushions."
i should have remembered that from my last set of buds that used fitted silicone cushions.
"also, i put the buds in my ears according to their marked position which required a magnifying glass and strong light to see on the back of each bud."
panasonic needs to color in the l and r to be more visible.
"yes, these are much more comfortable than the apple earbuds, but not yet ready to say they sound better."
"i still feel they are too bright on treble, but i am way more happier with them now."
well worth the few bucks in comparison to apple's pricing.
"i do miss the volume and pause controls, however."
"i use these at night when i'm sleeping (with pzizz or sleep sounds, etc)."
they have a very comfortably loose fit that makes them well-suited for that.
"if you have smaller ears, they might not be as comfortable at night, because they're made of hard plastic."
"first off, i like nice headphones."
"secondly, i don't like to break my nice headphones."
"if you're in the same position and want a pair of earbuds that you won't cry over losing or breaking, but don't want them to sound awful, then these are perfect."
"no, they don't sound as good as very expensive in-ear headphones."
do they sound amazing for less than 10 bucks?
absolutely.
"they're comfortable, well-designed, simple, and durable."
"the only design problem i have with them is that the thin cables tangle easily, which wouldn't happen if i wasn't too lazy to use a case."
"with that being said, even though the cables are thin, i haven't found them to be prone to getting shorts (where the sound crackles due to damage to the cord)."
"this is surprising, since i sleep with them on all the time and am constantly untangling them."
"i have two pair now, just because i wanted an extra pair to pack."
"i've had the original pair for over a year, and they're still working perfectly."
"i have tried other headphones around this price range, and these are the best i've found by a long shot."
"the other ones i've tried might have better cables or other design improvements, but they typically sound awful."
these sound good enough
"where i don't really feel like i'm listening to cheap headphones every time i use them, which is nice."
"i've had very bad luck with cheap bluetooth headphones due to issues with the bluetooth part of them, so i've stuck to buying wired headphones if i want them to be cheap."
"you can always plug them into a bluetooth adapter if you want, which is what i do."
"so, if you're spoiled by nice headphones but want to spare a pair of earbuds, or want a pair of headphones to wear to sleep, these are super."
i originally bought a pair of these back in december and they worked wonderfully!
then i lost them and decided to order another pair.
this new pair has been absolutely unsatisfactory.
they for some reason give my phone the impression that they are mic'd and that they are a wired speaker headset.
"whenever i so much as shift, they pause the music or open up google voice, even when i disabled voice commands."
it also will randomly switch songs and lower/raise the volume.
they will also randomly cut out and start to play the music from the phone speakers.
it happens not only when i'm listening to music but generally anytime my headphones are plugged in.
i want to get another pair
but i'm wary that the same thing will happen.
this is my second pair of these earbuds and this set is not as durable as the first purchased.
two issues with these headphones.
"first, the wires connecting the earbuds and the power are very thin and not durable."
"in the first three weeks, a tug on the power end pulled the wiring loose."
"still works, but i am anticipating failure soon."
"second, the volume setting required to amplify the sound in the earbuds"
is much higher than my old set.
this is in direct comparison to my previous set that is still functional.
"i realize they didn't cost much, but i expected this set to last and performance as well as my first purchase."
headphones are a fun thing to review since a lot of it is subjective and heavily opinionated.
"however, let it be known that those budget headphone reviewers are absolutely right about this pair of earbuds."
pros:-nicely
balanced eq-great sound at all volumes.
"maybe not at extemely high volumes, but mind you these are in-ear-around $10usdcons-very cheap."
in material quality.
"in the $10 price range, there are plenty of contenders that stand to the plate to deliver the best bang for your buck and in all honesty it makes it both easy and hard to pick out great brands."
of course you might consider trying to get a much cheaper pair for $5
but i can’t recommend that especially with my experiences in the past.
"in particular, these headphones are pretty good at giving a good enough soundspace and audio reproduction."
listening to bass heavy hits are just as delightful as listening to classical music.
"i do own two other earbuds at this price range, jvc gummies and skullcandy somethings."
jvc gummies are a very weak contender compared to the skullcandy earbuds and panasonic ergofit earbuds.
the other two are...
almost equal.
"i’d have to sit down and really listen with the both of them to form a more valuable comparison, but the both of them honestly have very similar sound signatures that it almost doesn’t matter."
"with 50k customer reviews, i'm in the minority."
"i use earbuds a lot for work phone calls, have been on the phone better part of 20 hrs / week throughout recent years."
"the mic seems fine (which is hard to come by so that is a plus), but the speaker quality is rotten, i can't describe but these are the worst i've ever had, almost hurts to have in ear and hear someone talk, my ears hurts from the sound quality."
"i ordered these last night around 11:00pm central time and they were delivered today, sunday, before noon."
what!
?
"i didn't pay for shipping, it was a prime item that was expected to arrive tuesday."
i've nerv had faster shipping on any item.
amazing.
"anyway, i opened them and have been using them the past two hours to make sure the sound is good"
and i'm very pleased.
everything is super clear and i can hear the bass in songs and even small intricacies that i must have been missing with my last pair of ear buds.
these fit my ears really well and stay in place.
they also come with two more sizes of gel covers in case the originals don't fit to your liking.
"the length of the cord is long, which is nice."
i'm very happy with the earbuds.
update :
"i removed one star from this review because the second night i used these, they stopped working on my tablet."
"they still work on my phone, but when i try them on my tablet, they won't work."
"i tried another pair on my tablet and those work fine, so i know it must be these headphones."
i have no idea why they'd work on both devices for a day
and then the following day only work on one.
i've tried several days in a row now and they still only work on my phone.
strange.
i have bought about 4 pairs of these earbuds before-
"loved them, lightweight, fit in the ear great with great sound"
"but this most recent pair i purchased the very first time i played them they had very weak volume with slight crackles and shifts from ear to ear, nothing like all my previous pairs.  "
the thing that disturbs me is this recent pair
i got sounded like some cheap walmart crap
", i don't know if it was a single defective pair or because this is the #1 rated earbud that they are now choosing to lower the manufacturing quality.  "
either way it makes me leery about buying additional pairs in the future.  
"these ones i have now aren't even good enough for a one time listen, they sound like crap."
"for the longest time, i was purchasing cheap, non-branded earbuds."
the lifespan of these were not very long.
"either the headphone connection went bad or one of the sides would short out, which started with this annoying crackle."
"by the time i added it all up, i was spending so much"
i might as well pay for a better pair.
that's my stupidity!
it's hard to believe how many types of earbuds there are.
too many to choose from!
"out of them all, i decided on this pair."
"for the price, i can't get over how well these panasonic earbuds sound."
the sound is clear and there is just enough bass where it isn't overbearing!
"in comparison to the cheaper pairs i was previously buying, the sound is 10 times better and doesn't have that ""tin can"" effect."
"now, take note on this particular pair i am reviewing does not have a built-in microphone nor volume control, but for my simple taste i don't need all that."
"if you do, i would try another model or brand."
goodluck!
"i've noticed some other reviewers writing warnings about counterfeit products, due to them receiving products with varying levels of quality."
i too have experienced this.
"i ordered my first two pairs of earbuds in november 2018 and april 2019, both from the amazon.com services inc. vendor, and they were of excellent quality."
"i then ordered another pair in august from a third party vendor (a very highly rated vendor, mind you)."
but the quality of this third pair was far lower than the first two.
i brought this to the attention of amazon and was given a replacement pair.
the replacement pair (from same vendor) was also very low quality.  
"contacting amazon again, they offered me a full refund and told me to just keep the earbuds."
"about a month later in september, i decided to try one more time (i really love these earbuds)."
"having realized that the ""counterfeit"" earbuds came from a third-party vendor, i decided to order again from"
amazon.com services inc. this was the vendor that i originally ordered from.
"this time, the pair i received were excellent quality."
"now, i'm not completely certain that the lower quality pair were counterfeits."
it could easily be that panasonic contracts many different manufacturing plants to make these earbuds.
"some of these plants might have different quality control standards, and this third party vendor (which was very highly rated) might've gotten a bad batch."
i did notice a slight difference on the packaging between the earbuds.
"on the back of the packaging, all the way down at the bottom, there is a four character code."
the code for the good pair is 8i1h.
the code for the bad pair is 8g3h.
"my guess is that these codes are either identifying the batch number, or the plant that they came from."
that is all the information that i have.
i hope this can help others figure out what is going on.
"my advice to anyone considering buying these earbuds is to buy two or three pairs from two or three different vendors, compare the different qualities"
"(it will be obvious which pairs are ""real"" and which ones are ""counterfeits""), and return the lower quality pair(s)."
they are fantastic earbuds if you can get a good pair.
these are the best of the best in ear headphones for the price.
and here is why:1.
"i have about 15 different headphones, some of them are very high end, and only reason i bought these was its size."
i sleep on my side and play something until i fall a sleep or listen an audio book.
"when you turn to side to fall a sleep with earbuds in your ears, you need really small ones that doesn't protrude outside contours of ears."
otherwise pillow presses to earbuds into your ear canal and it hurts.
so these earbuds are so small and excellty fit
", you can turn to side and fall a sleep when they are in your ears.2."
they sound fantastic when compared to peers like sony or apple or many other unknown chinese brands.
"music is crystal clear, and detailed, great bass, incredible sound staging."
for this price it is a steal.
"after listening this, you wouldn't put crappy apple earbuds again."
as you can guess i use an iphone as a source.3.
i would never expect noise isolation from these buds.
but anatomically it seals to ear canal very well.
key is silicon seals attached to an oval opening instead of a circular one like many other earbuds.
so it fits better.
"when you listen music with these earbuds, it seals surrounding noise"
"so well, you can't hear a ringing office phone in front of you."
i compare this
"the benchmark active noise canceling bose quitecomfort 35 bluetooth headphones, and i own one."
these little earbuds seals background noise nearly as good as bose.
since they are very tiny and you can fall a sleep when these one in your ears.
so this 8$ little earbuds are more convenient than 350
$
bose headphones.
by all means bose sounds better.
size always matters.4.
"price, only 8$ incredible for this kind of sound quality.5."
"durability is unknown, since i have been using only for a month."
but they are perfect.
these earbuds are great!
"the earbuds are surprisingly comfortable, and produce a fantastic sound even when the volume is low."
"they drown out background sounds extremely well, even when i just have the buds in with no sound coming through (my office can get noisy, and sometimes its nice to mute it out, without having to counter it with more sound)."
"the cord is the common plastic cord (nothing braided, wrapped, or fancy as with some other earbuds)"
so i will be cautious when handling to reduce the occurance of accidental cord pinching!
"although the design seems a bit odd at first glance, the fit is actually perfect!"
"seriously, its perfect, and i have had no issues with them falling out"
as im putting around with them in.
it also came with 2 other sizes of silicone caps for the earbuds if the first ones arent a match for everyone else.
the color is fun  and keeps them from getting lost in the sea of black and white cords..
so many cords....
"it comes with a built in mic (a personal must-have) and from what ive tested so far, it picks up sounds with crystal clear clarity."
it doesnt have volume control (as some other ones do) but thats not a big deal for me.
i really like these.
"the sound is good, the fit is comfortable, the shipping is fast, and the price is right!"
"the cord on these is short, not 3.6' as claimed..."
maybe around 2.6'.
"i had to buy another pair for the office and just give these to my daughter, because they wouldn't even reach from my computer tower to my head, let alone with any extra room to move."
that's what i get for buying them especially because they came in purple.
the cuteness is kinda pointless when you can't use them.
"they'd be fine for use with your cell phone, but not for anything you're not holding or carrying in a jacket pocket."
"i'm not a fake profile, nor have i been compensated for any reviews..."
"in fact, the reason i take the time to review purchases when i can is due to the fact that i find other honest reviews helpful and am tired of all the fake reviews that have polluted this site."
"if you find my review helpful, please take the time to rate it as such, not because i'll get anything out of it"
but so that others can see true reviews.
thanks and happy shopping!
these little headphones are great!
i put them in my ears the moment i got them and did yardwork for three hours.
"they were perfectly comfortable and noise isolating, allowing the music to play cleanly and loud enough to overcome the lawnmower."
"the only thing i thought could use improvement, and for seven dollars it's still not that big a deal, was the cable is kind of flimsy."
so i took 20 minutes and splice the cable into some para cord/shrink tubing and now they feel like $100 earbuds.
"the sound is a little bassy, but very punchy and clear."
perfect for airline travel.
"after much trial and error with many other higher priced earbuds/headphones, these panasonic kick much butt!!!"
the fit is perfect and stays snug up to about 45 to 60 minutes of vigorous workouts.
if not working out then the fit stays in perfect contact indefinitely.
i've been using these for years.
"recently, i ventured out in search of some wireless earbuds/headphones ... and have been terribly disspointed so far."
here's the scoop ...
funcl true wireless earbuds ...
sound quality is horrible with very little audible bass.
"the only positive is that they seem to stay in the ear, which some ""true wireless"" fail to do."
these funcl true wireless earbuds are far inferior to the $19.99 letscom bluetooth headphones ipx7 and $8.35 panasonic ergofit
in-ear earbud headphones rp-hje120-s
"(wired).the bliiq bluetooth headphones, hifi bass stereo with mic, [hummingbird][ambient mode|spinfit earbuds] have better sound quality, but simply will not stay in the ear while working out or doing anything else."
"hopefully, this helps others not waste time."
"i've been desperately seeking a high-quality pair of wireless earbuds, but so far i'm sticking with the panasonic and letscom"
(mentioned above) because they are much much better ... and cost a fraction of bliiq and funcl's wireless/bluetooth.
why pay more for less?!
"i first bought a pair of these 3 years ago and was amazed at the quality of sound, especially for the price."
"they were clear and balanced, not too bass heavy or distorted like so many cheap headphones are."
"and they lasted for over a year before the sound went out in one ear, which is pretty good."
i listen to music for several hours a day
so most headphones in t price range don’t last beyond a few months.
"i bought a couple more pairs and enjoyed them very much for the next 2 years, until my new kitten ruined them by chewing through the cords."
i bought another pair and waited patiently for them to arrive.
"it was really hard working without music for several days, and so i was beyond excited when i checked my mailbox to see they had arrived."
my excitement didn’t last.
"as soon as i put them on, i realized the sound quality had declined significantly from the previous pairs."
the bass is too loud now and the treble notes buzz and crackle in a way that hurts my ears at normal volumes.
"and the left ear keeps going in an out, requiring me to adjust it and wiggle the cord frequently."
"i doubt they’ll last long at all, and seeing so many other similar recent reviews has really made me sad."
i guess it’s time to find a new brand or invest some money into something that will last longer.
update 9/15/17: from 5 stars to 2 stars: the earbuds i bought a few weeks ago are difficult to connect to my smart phone; the connector is wrapped in an almost square shaped covering that i have to force into the round hole of my phone case.
i have never seen such a dumb design - it is literally making a square peg fit into a round hole.
"thankfully, the round hole on the phone case is somewhat pliable."
"however, the square peg comes out too easily from the round hole, thus, only three stars."
the sound is still great and the buds stay in my ear just fine.
but that does not help when the square peg on the other end pops out of the round hole in my case.
very disappointing.
"original review, written for an older pair of earbuds than the ones i bought 5-6 weeks ago:"
"to my great surprise, i love these earbuds!  "
they are even more comfortable than the apple ones i have replaced a couple of times at $30 each time.  
i was concerned that they would plug up my ears to make the pressure painful
- i have had some of those over the years - but these do not.  
"i can also hear what is going on around me when i wear these, which is a plus if i am out walking and listening to music.  "
"sound is great, fit is perfect, both of which are the most important to me, as they probably are to all who buy earbuds.  "
highly recommended.
"only con: if i watch a movie or listen to music in bed and fall asleep with these in my ears, they are not comfortable to sleep with; they feel lumpy and bothersome when i sleep on my side.  "
"thus, i use my old apple ones (which are down to only one plug since the other one stopped working) if i want to listen to a movie or music in bed since the apple ones are ""flatter"" against my ears."
"for the price, this is a good deal."
"while cheaply made with very thin cords and so on, the price is fantastic."
the sound is fine for listening to the news on my laptop while not disturbing others or listening to my voice messages on my phone while maintaining privacy.
audiophiles will want something more sophisticated but will pay far more.
one thing i like about these is that the pin you plug in is at a 90-degree angle so that when i have my laptop on its side it doesn't stick straight out
and i can scoot the laptop a little onto the base i keep it on so that the pin doesn't break off.
they come in a blister pack with some printed material and two extra sets of rubber ear pads--one set that is larger than the set that's installed and one set that is smaller than the installed set.
there is no case or bag included.
"i purchased this after the earbuds included with my s5 phone began to fail after 30 months, including times when i accidentally sat on them and pulled, probably pulling on the wires in the process."
"plus, the plastic parts started to fall off."
"because i wanted to take time to find the best set of earbuds or earphones to replace them without going overboard, i decided to buy these just so i could listen privately to things until i had time to research."
i decide i could tuck them into a tiny zippered plastic bag and keep it in my bag for use listening to my phone when out and about
and then keep the nicer pair i get after research at home.
the only reason i'm giving this a 3-star rating is that these are flimsy looking
and i don't expect them to last a long time.
"for the price, they are perfectly adequate."
this would be a decent set to give to a kid prone to losing things so they can keep them in their backpack.
"for the price, this is a good deal."
"while cheaply made with very thin cords and so on, the price is fantastic."

we have been using these earbuds for only 7 months and they no longer work.  
very disappointed and would not recommend.
update:  panasonic customer service terrible.  
called to ask about warranty.  
"when i purchased these on amazon, i chose them because it stated a 1 year warranty.  "
"now this information has been taken off amazon, apparently because it was an error.  "
i even spoke to panasonic confirming date of purchase
and they told me to send them in for  replacement.  
they were retuned stating out of warranty.  
was only 90 day.  
now i understand.  
they are not worth $10.  
they were charging $25 to repair.
i actually really like these earphones.  
they are good value for their price
", i've bought several pairs of them.  "
unfortunately the latest pair after under 2 months broke (sound in one ear stopped working).  
this is worse than normal
so i decided to try the warranty.  
"the support hours are all terrible, for me, luckily they have an online form, or so i thought."
whenever i try to submit the online support form the page just refreshes itself and shows that no support forms have been submitted.  
 panasonic any way to fix this?
the packaging for these headphones was literally one of the hardest things i've had to open so that was slightly annoying.  
"what was really annoying is that the headphones came with bad wiring so any slight movement caused the sound to cut out, or the sound to become distorted.  "
they aren't usable.  
"also, the package came with the rubber ear bud replacements..."
"i only received 1 small sized ear bud replacement, not a set.. and the small ear buds are the size i use.  "
not good :(
i got this pair of headphones a few years ago and loved them.
"for the price, the sound quality was great and the mid-wire button is a big convenience."
"unfortunately, had an accident and ended up breaking the wire and that pair was lost."
the trouble began when i ordered a replacement pair after ruining my first pair.
the first replacement pair arrived and immediately out of the box the sound was cutting in and out before quickly stopping entirely in one ear.
"additionally, the button didn’t work at all"
and i narrowed the problem to the strain relief as i could cause some variation by getting it to just the right spots.
i decided to return the pair for a replacement.
second pair arrived and worked well initially
but then i quickly encountered very similar issues.
"not to the same degree as the first, but i’ve noticed the strain relief is quite touchy on this pair too."
"it’s degraded to the point that if it so much as gets bumped, sound will cut out in one or both ears."
it’s very unfortunate as the first pair i had was great
and i was and am quite happy with the sound quality when it’s working.
my guess is that the way it’s packaged forces the wire/relief to bend in a way that causes damage to the wires internally
but i don’t know for sure.
either way it’s an unfortunate decline in quality
and i won’t order these headphones again.
i can't believe these are so cheap!
these sound fantastic.
i mean i can feel myself getting fitter and more productive already.
"i put on a ""running"" song to try out the quality"
and i immediately wanted to go running.
i don't really run.
at least i haven't in a while.
i think i'll go now.
or maybe i'll clean the house...something that involves moving.
i got purple cause every color is a slightly different price
and they were one of the cheapest.
i actually ended up liking the color.
it comes with 3 different size rubber tips to fit your size ears.
still the best.  
"i am an audiophile jerk who loves accurate, clear sound.  "
"i enjoy pop, but usually classical music and opera are my thing.  "
"most inexpensive headphones are colored with way too much bass and otherwise, don't have the volume of a timid mouse.  "
"sometimes thin, sometimes tinny, sometimes anemic.  "
or all of the above.
"for ten bucks, these are the richest sounding in the ear headphones i have ever owned.  "
i use these with my google pixel and the nt app which offers fantastic eq.  
"imaging, volume, and detailed reproduction of even the most delicate passages."
and.
i am a clutz.  
i have gotten in the car and drive for miles with these puppies dragging on the pavement.  
they still work perfectly.  
"m french bulldog has played with them, and i have slept on them, stepped on them, and had them out in the rain.  "
"takes a licking, and keeps on ticking."
highly recommend.  
"while your are at it, buy a dozen."
after breaking another pair of earphones i had to go through the process of choosing and getting a new one.
i did not want to spend a lot but
at the same time didn't want to have them broken after less then few months.
so i went to amazon and looked what the best seller and amazon's suggestions are.
"in the beginning i was very skeptical about panasonic earphones, not only because of a low price, but also because i never owned a pair of this brand."
i whatsoever decided to order these to try them out.
"i am amazed by the quality after having used them for half a year, they did not go bad at all."
"the sound quality is just fine, none of the strings broke, earbuds are soft and did not get lost or disconnected and it fits great with all of my devices."
"the only disadvantages are that since the strings are thin, they often get messy and that this set does not have a microphone."
"however, having that said, it is still an incredible quality price relationship."
i am fully satisfied with my choice and strongly recommend these for people with small budget for earphones.
apparently (from the reviews here)
this item once had pretty decent sound quality for cheap earbuds.  
"however, i can confirm that they sure don't now,  "
"i know what seriously good speakers and phones sound like, and i obviously wasn't expecting anything like that, but these things have an aggressively raw sound at the high end that is much worse than any earbuds"
i've ever heard - both genuine apple and $5 imitations.
"these might be be better for speech intelligibility in a noisy environment, but listening to music for more than 5 minutes is torture."
i’ve bought these headphones twice.
"with the first purchase, the wiring became exposed in the cord for the left earbud."
i purchased these a second time because i figured my cat had gotten to them or something.
"with the second purchase, i am currently in the process of losing hearing in the second earbud.  "
a static noise has started to appear & there is a noticeable difference in the sound volume between the two earbuds.
"i have been cautious with this pair, so there is no reason for the sudden decline in quality except for poor manufacturing."
i've bought genuine panasonic headphones in the past and i've been perfectly happy with them.  
"as other reviewers correctly point out in commendable detail, the ones being sold here appear to be counterfeits.  "
"they are not actual panasonic headphones, and i would steer clear of them until amazon gets the matter straightened out."
"unlike the ones i've bought in years past, the pair that i purchased in october 2019 had loose connections creating static crackling the first time they were used."
"even though i rarely use earbuds and am extremely gentle with them, i find myself buying them about twice a year.  "
these are replacing a set of sony earbuds in a similar price range.  
"like the sony pairs, they will not last long.  "
the sound quality and overall functionality are also similar.  
these buds lack grommets where the wire enters and it's almost certain to be a failure point.  
even the strain of pulling them out of the excessive packaging risks a short.  
the cable holds a coil very well and will likely never lay flat - having a cord constantly tickling my neck or cheek
makes these much less comfortable than the cheap sony devices.  
"and lastly, the plastic cups that you stick into your ears are made from a gummy material that attracts small particles like dust and lint.  "
i would not recommend using these devices for stow and go scenarios unless you carry them in a ziploc or something.  
"otherwise, you're going to be introducing a lot of foreign materials into your ear.  "
"although the driver is ovoid, the little cups have round openings; swapping them out is tremendously difficult.  "
the stock cup on one earbud i received had a tear in it and had to be replaced before use.
"i've ordered this same item about 4 times, they usually last for about a year or two and then either break"
or i lose them
", week i'm totally fine with since they're usually inexpensive and good quality."
"when i ordered this pair, they were still inexpensive, but the quality had fallen off a cliff."
it seems like panasonic has either outsourced production to an inferior subcontractor or i received some kind of knock off.
"the largest, glaring problem is that the aux plug is too long."
"i compared it to my existing pair (which only has one working earbud,"
"hence why i ordered the new pair), and the plug is a couple mm longer at least."
"this means that it can't lock in to my aux plug on my phone the way the old ones did, and it also means that there's a huge amount of static and interference whenever the plug is rotated at all."
it makes it impossible to listen to anything.
"general build quality has taken a nosedive as well between my older pair and these, they don't seem nearly as solidly made."
"i wouldn't recommend these for anyone, at least until you can be sure you're getting the real deal and not the garbage"
i just returned.
i just bought these to replace a set of
skull candy ear buds that got wrecked at the gym.
these come with 3 sizes of foam ear piece inserts which i found make a huge difference.  
the mid size come installed on the buds.  
took these out of the package and headed to the gym w/o listening first.  
i hated them.  
"sounded tinny,"
no bass and
i could hear everything around me which i had not experienced w/
the skulls.  
tried the other inserts and huge difference.  
"counter-intuitively, thought the smaller inserts would allow the buds to go deeper into my ear canal and give me a better sound.  "
wrong.  
"the larger 'block out' external noise and 'trap' for lack of a better term, the sound in your ear giving more mid/base.  "
these are not great
but i don't hate them the way i did at first.  
still not sure they are an improvement over the skulls but are close if not equal.
i've purchased 4 pairs of these without the mic in the past and have love them.
so i thought i would get a pair with a mic so that i could listen to music and take calls without having to change headsets.
i noticed right away that there were some differences in how they looked and not really in a good way.
they looked cheaper than they did before
"but i felt like i can't be too picky with earbuds that cost so little, but the real problem came when i listened to music."
i had to turn the music up higher than i usually do in order to hear it and the bass and sound quality were not nearly as good as my other pair.
i've done a comparison of switching out my old pair with my new ones just to make sure i'm not imagining things
and they are for sure lower quality sound.
i'm very disappointed and will not be purchasing another pair in the future.
i feel cheated because it seems like panasonic is doing a bait-and-switch using the good reviews from a better product to sell an inferior product now.
"on a side note, one suggestion to panasonic would be to make sure the mic is facing inward when the earbud is in the ear because the one i have faces out"
so i have to hold it in the right position while i talk or the other person just hears my surroundings instead of my voice.
"again, these are cheap"
"so i can understand, but it would make it a much nicer product."
"okay, sure, it's cheap to buy this."
"and you may have different results than i did, but i had two problems with it."
"first, the cord developed a short within the first 40 days of ownership."
"i use it several times a week, and i'm using it while trail running, so the unit gets bounced around a bit."
still… 40 days?
i've had other headphones i use while trail running that have lasted two or three years.  
"i personally mind if the sound cuts out occasionally, so i had to downgrade this one considerably for value."
a $50 headset that lasts two years is actually cheaper than a $10 headset that lasts less than two months.
"second, i've never been able to get a solid fit with the earpiece design."
"i've tried different sizes of the earbuds, but not been able to get them to stay in place, unless i physically hold them with my hands into my ear canals."
"it's not easy to run a trail while doing that, so, in short, i don't think i'll ever be buying these again."
see photo.  
one reviewer here actually had a negative review and they were right!  
if your gadget is inside a case - and that case's audio hole is too small - you are hosed.  
these will not work.  
if they do fit your case (if applicable)
then you are home free.  
"these by-far are the best ""bang for the buck"""
ear buds i've ever purchased.  
they are both cheap and good.  
but i can't say it enough:  
"there's a rectangular block of plastic at the end of these ear buds, where the audio prong is.  "
mine just barely fit into my phone's case.  
i tried to include a ruler in the photo to help you measure yours.  
friends i kid you not:  if that audio area in your case is smaller than the one in the photo - these won't work for you.  
otherwise they are absolutely wonderful.
edit:
these worked for less than 1 day.
"i tried them out right after they arrived, the sound good and they were very comfortable to wear."
"i watched half of a movie on my laptop, switched them to my mp3 and walked 3 miles, did a little stretching then put them on my dresser..."
the next morning i started my mp3 and the sound in the left ear
kept going in and out
", i checked to make sure the jack was plugged in all the way and as soon as i touched it the sound came back but when i let go it went out in the left ear again."
"i'm an adult, not hard on the things i have"
(i've had the same sony mp3 player for 4 years and it's going strong)
and i know better than to pull on the cord when removing the buds from my ears
so obviously i'm not impressed with the durability will be asking amazon for a refund.
yay!
finally a pair of earbuds that don't hurt my ears...
"not sure why it is, maybe i have small ears, but i frequently have problems with earbuds hurting after wearing them for only a minute or two."
"i haven't had any problem with these hurting even when wearing the for long periods of time, in fact they are really comfortable, and so far they are staying put in my ears when i'm doing busy with more energetic activities ("
"think biking, yoga, vacuuming, race walking, etc.)."
"sound is good (although i'm no audiophile), clear without any undesirable static noises and the bass sounds good to me."
"i can't speak for their ability to stand up to daily use as i haven't had them long, but if they fail i'll come back with an update."
i gave them 4 stars because they are so far as expected and haven't disappointed me.
"i rarely give 5 stars, only if something performs well above and beyond expectations"
so a 4 star rating is high in my book.
"sound quality is about average, low base and high treble, maybe appropriate for phone calls but not to great with music, which sounds like an old am transistor radio i built as a child once.  "
"noise cancellation is poor, but then this style rarely does the job adequately (over-the-ear headphones are much better at noise cancellation).  "
"as moisture wicking is not a function of this style headphone, that was scored as a 1 and not considered in overall score."
"in short, it is functional for calls, the main reason i have it, but beyond that i could not recommend this to others.  "
"panasonic had once been a great brand, but if they can't get this right, i don't think i should consider much more costly and complex items from them."
"(if you're wondering, it's because the cat thinks they're fabulous cat toys and can manage to find them no matter where i hide them, and i'm usually too lazy to move all my furniture when a replacement costs a few dollars."
"if and when i move out of my current apartment, i'll probably find a dozen pairs in the weirdest places.)because"
"i'm so prone to ""losing"" them — [typed with heavy side-eye aimed in the cat's direction]"
— i tend to find the cheapest ones i can.
"i've got a more expensive bluetooth set, but i'm terrible at remembering to charge them, so i like to have a corded pair handy and"
"the last time i was shopping for earbuds, i opted for these."
"(mental note: next time, get a bright pair even if the black ones are cheaper..."
easier to find.)i point this out to make sure you understand my selection criteria: they have to be cheap.
i don't need them to be attractive or have the best sound or whatever people normally try to find when they're shopping for earbuds.
"i mean, yes, i'd like them to work period, but for the most part i use them in bed to watch golden girls reruns on my phone."
high quality is just a bonus.
"and yet i'm still giving these four stars; for the price, they're absolutely fine."
"they get tangled worse than christmas lights, but i've yet to find a pair that doesn't do that, so i can't really downgrade them for that."
"and no, they don't sound like a state-of-the-art stereo system."
"they haven't crapped out yet, though, and they're cheap enough that i can replace them if they eventually do."
"i've been ordering panasonic headphones for years, and i've always been happy with them."
"they're usually comfortable, fit well, and last a decent amount of time for what you pay for them."
"however, my latest purchase was quite the opposite experience that i was expecting."
"i ordered a new pair as my old ones had finally kicked the bucket, the same exact pair as my old ones."
"this time, the part that plugs into the audio jack was crackling constantly and the audio would cut in and out when it was touched."
the right earbud was also much quieter than the left.
"i sent them back and ordered a replacement of the same exact headphones, thinking my problems would be solved."
"nope, they got even worse."
"same exact problems with the replacement item, only now the right earbud won't even fit into my ear properly (i've never had problems with it before, and even got a relative to try it out, she also said it didn't fit correctly)"
while the left earbud stays in snug like it should.
extremely disappointed in the last two products.
"not sure if it was a bad batch or what, but i won't be purchasing panasonic headphones again."
over the years i have purchased probably around 25 pairs of headphones of all different kinds.
i use them for everything from casual listening to working out.
i like this model of headphones so much that i bought my wife this pair.
these are the best headphones that i have found that stay in my ears while i'm working out.
they aren't rounded like most of the earbuds they are oval-shaped.
the round ones always seem to pop out of my ear or hurt my ear even though there are usually different sizes to choose from.
the sound quality on these are great and the cord is long enough so that i could put my phone in my pocket while i'm lifting weights or on the treadmill while i'm running.
"i tend to sweat a lot which usually leads to one of the earbuds not working and other models, this hasn't happened to me on this model."
these are such a great deal that i would recommend these to anyone looking for earbuds that stay in your ears while working out.
the sound quality is equal or better than most headphones 4x the price.
these are hands-down the best earbuds i've ever owned.
tl;dr
": they're insanely cheap, comfortable (even for side-sleeping), sound great, and durable as hell."
i 100% recommend these.
read on for the longer version.
i used to go through a pair of earbuds about every 9 months to a year.
"one ear would quit working, a cord would break or pull out, etc.."
"i'm not super careful with earbuds--i keep them in my pocket, occasionally drop them, get them damp, things like that."
"however, these buds lasted me a year and a half, working perfectly the whole time."
the only reason i had to get a new pair is because my old ones got run over in a parking lot.
and they still sort of worked!
"despite being literally in pieces, sound came out of both buds and the remote button still worked."
"i was genuinely gutted when they broke because i was afraid they wouldn't still be available--thank god they are!other than amazing durability, these are just all-around quality headphones."
"first, they're comfy."
"i regularly sleep (on my side) in them, and i almost never wake up with sore ears."
they're also usually still in when i wake up in the morning.
"these are the first buds i've seen that had the actual speakers (like, the part inside the rubber tips) shaped to fit the ears."
"most are circles, these are ovals."
this would probably also make them comfy for small-eared folks.
"i'm no true audiophile, so i can't comment on the specifics of the sound quality."
"but for my purposes, the sound is great."
"it's crisp, the bass is pretty strong, and the volume range is good."
the noise isolation is also pretty darn impressive.
"(these are noise-isolating, not noise-cancelling, to be clear.)another little thing i find handy"
is the right-angled connector.
"my audio jack is on the bottom of my phone, so this lets me rest it on things without feeling like i'm breaking the cable."
it also makes it harder to accidentally catch on things.
the only negative thing i have to say about these is that i really wish the mic/remote had volume controls.
"it does have one ""universal"" button, so you can accept and end calls, pause music, skip tracks, etc."
","
but it's annoying to have to pick up my whole phone to change the volume.
i guess for some another negative might be the looks.
"they're very plain, plastic, not flashy."
"personally, that doesn't matter much to me."
"and apparently they do offer some color options, if that's your thing."
"in sum, these are fantastic."
"for under $15, you really can't beat them."
i'll definitely be repurchasing (if i ever need to).
"i ordered these once and had no problems, until they broke when i tripped over the wire."
"recently, my ear buds broke (that were made by a different brand), so i decided to order these."
when they came i realised they were in a completely different packaging that didnt resemble the packaging of the first pair at all.
"the left side didn't work even though they had never been used, so i got them replaced with a new pair."
i just got the new pair and
the left ear doesn't work.
"don't order these, i've looked at other reviews and others have had the same problem, that the ear buds have two different qualities."
"it shouldn't be this hard to make a reliable product, but apparently it is."
"unless you like only hearing out of one ear, skip ordering these and buy from a different brand."
"compared to many other earbuds that i've had that cost $75, $100, $150..."
these sound as good as any of them.  
i'm astounded!  
i use these for running
and i've attached them to my sunglasses along with my ipod shuffle.  
"i figured for $8, i could afford to sweat up a few of these and replace them whenever i needed to.  "
"i've run 1,500 miles with these in the last year and a half!!  "
"i've gone through 4 pairs of new balance shoes, 2 ipod shuffles, 3 pairs of sunglasses and am on the same set of earbuds!!  "
"and, they still sound great!  "
see my picture of the earbuds on my sunglasses.  
"pretty dorky,"
"but hey, they work great"
and they stay in my ears too!
"first of all, i was shipped the wrong ones."
so i had to return those and get new ones.
they sent me the ones without the mic even though i ordered ones with the mic.
i am mad because these stopped working within a month.
they never leave my bedside table and i don't use them all that often.
the right side (side with the mic) is what stopped working.
it's not my phone because i use other headphones and an aux cord in my car.
i don't have an iphone so that weird dongle thing isn't an issue either.
not sure how they broke but whatever.
waste of money - don't buy.
"otherwise, they were good."
"they are a good fit for my ears, sound quality wasn't amazing"
but it was pretty good.
"they had a nice long cord, although cheap-feeling."
but i didn't care since i only ever used them while in my bed.
"i can't speak to the quality of the mic, since i never had a chance to use it."
"the pause button worked (and still does even though that bud is broken).overall, total waste of money."
these buds fit very loosely in my ears.  
"if i try to push them in slightly, to make them snugger, then the sound becomes very low level and muddy;  probably pushing in the buds obstructs the small hole where the sound comes out."
sound balance is very much lacking in low frequencies.  
by comparison the highs (of course) seem much louder; that makes it difficult to assess the *quality
*
of the highs.  
"at any rate, i find the balance very unpleasant for music listening.  "
"they might be ok for audio books, but i wanted them for music."
"they have no ""noise cancellation"" because that feature require active circuitry and small microphones on each earpiece.  "
"(in fact i can't think of any earbuds that have noise cancellation, although everybody has heard of the bose noise cancelling"
*headphones* which are pretty good.
"if amazon really wanted to ask about ""noise isolation"" ... ability of the device to keep external noise from sneaking into the ear canal ..."
then these earbuds could have that feature.  
they could ...
but they don't.  
isolation is almost nonexistent.
"the amazon review form asks about ""moisture wicking.""  "
how could earbuds have that feature?  
headphones might have a headband with a moisture wicking pad; headphones might have moisture wicking ear pads.  
but this product is not a headphone ...
it's an earbud.  
"as such, ""moisture wicking"" doesn't apply afaik.in conclusion, these are very disappointing.  "
sonically they are think and basically awful for music.  
"if you want something that sounds a whole lot better, try a pair of tascam"
hd-02 *headphones
*.  
"sure, they're not earbuds, and they're not the world's best headphones.  "
"but they are acceptable, they are much better than these earbuds, and they cost roughly $18.00.of course if you want bad-sounding orange toys in your ears, these panasonic earbuds are perfect for you."
"was given these as a present - wife bought them based on the overall good reviews, but they didnt work at all for me."
"now, to be fair, in-ear is not my favorite style of headphones, but that wasn't the issue, they were actually fairly comfortable."
the issue is the sound isn't consistent and was terrible.
"when i could get it to be consistently stay plugged in properly, sound was fairly good."
"my suspicion is the plug isn't built properly - any slight movement of the wire, my phone, etc."
"would cause the sound to be bad - only in one ear, volume would go down, remote wouldn't work, etc."
"would go in an out, especially if i put my phone in my pocket and was walking, which i often do."
i'm pretty sure the plug wasn't staying in the headphone jack properly - maybe it was too small?
"i thought maybe my phone case was doing something (i.e. too thick and was 'pulling' the cord out), but tried without the case and had the same issue."
"on another note, couldn't figure out how to use the remote on the wire to change the volume - maybe i was missing how to use it for that, but i'm usually pretty good with this stuff, so pretty sure there wasn't a way to change the volume with it -"
"if this was the case, it is a bad design."
"i really wanted to like these headphones, but at least the pair"
i have just don't work like they should.
"i'm going to try to replace these, as i'm hoping that perhaps i just got a defective pair."
"hopeful that a new pair will be better, but not entirely convinced...."
"if a new pair works better, i plan to update this review."
i've purchased these earbuds multiple times throughout this year because they've kept failing.
"i've purchased one this may and another this july, and when i got sick of repurchasing the item, i've attempted to contact panasonic to have the item warrantied."
"when i called the panasonic phone line that was listed on my order, i was informed that the wait time to reach a rep was around 20 minutes, and i might potentially be charged ""$9.99"" for the call."
i hung up immediately and attempted the online support chat.
"before the conversation even started, and before i said anything, i was told ""this product has a 90 day warranty""."
which leads me to believe panasonic wants to discourage their users from attempting to warranty their items.
"i was told that in order to use the 90 day warranty, i will need to ship the item to one of their facilities, and i would need to pay for the shipping."
"panasonic appears to go out of their way to provide short window for warranties, and even when you qualify for the warranty, discourages you even further by having you shell-out for shipping, which basically amounts to the cost of a new product."
"needless to say, this will be the last time i purchase earbuds/earphones from panasonic, and this will have bearing on my purchasing decisions in the future for all panasonic products and services."
update:
they failed after 60 days.
craptastic.
no better than the cheap $3 chinese knock off.
these fit snuggly and don't come out.
this is important to me as i sleep with them in sometimes.
when i wake up they're still in my ears.
"they don't block a lot of sound, maybe equivalent to a 15 or 20db earplug?"
because they fit so snuggly into the ear canal i can sleep on my side comfortably with no protrusion poking into the pillow beneath or rubbing my ear or the side of head uncomfortably.
i would take these over a pair airpods anyday because they fit so great and stay put even while jogging.
there's something very comfortable and secure feeling with this style that goes deep into the ear canal that i love.
"the sound quality is great with a good frequency response, plenty of bass."
the mic button works nicely to pause/play video and music.
haven't tested the mic
yet
so i can't review that
but everything else is a+

"i have 14 headphones and earbuds , some are like studio quality and others are for more casual use."
"most of them have better sound quality than this one, but !"
most of them are not as comfortable in my ears as these and all of them cost more ( way more ).
"i always carry this earbud with me, already for 6 years,"
"sometimes  i lost them, sometimes the give up ( usually after 1 + year ) .  "
let me tell you about pros and conspros: very affordable /
the sound for the price is really good/
the sound is more balanced than many a bit more expensive ones
i've bought/ very comfortable in your ear
", sometimes i forget i'm wearing them/ great for running as there is no cord abrasion noise"
"while listening to music, that is very irritating/ sound isolation is adequate.cons: this is not the earbud for audiophiles/ on the picture you can see how my tangles up, but i'm used to it"
anyways/
"the cords don't have any extra-protection, it does not get damaged easily ( with my experience"
"and i usually fall asleep with these and wake up tangled up in it ), but there is a better chance that you might tear the cable."
"i'm using earphones and earbuds very often, like 4-8 hours a day, but this one is one of the most used ones."
"because of it's comfort and cheap price, i can wear them everywhere and don;t have to worry if they brake or get lost."
"it's a budget friendly item, that i'm coming back to."
"it won't replace your high end earphones for an excellent  sound quality, but will have it's valuable place in your arsenal"
"and if you are like me, you might end up using it more frequently than other ones."
i don't think you can beat these for durability for the price.  
i wear these for 3-5 hours a day for commuting and workouts.  
the first pair lasted 8 months before the right channel started cutting in and out.  
this is from the tip wearing out over time which is expected.
other models in this price range would fail under heavy use as soon as a few weeks and certainly within 3 months.
the sound quality is nothing to get excited about.  
when they are fit properly in your ears the sound is very mid-range heavy almost like an old am radio and they also suppress external sound.  
i have no idea what the  wirecutter is talking about in their review by the way.  
for apps with eq i cut the mids and boost the bass and treble to clear up the sound.  
apps that don't have eq are muddy and unlistenable.  
the noise suppression caused cramming an expanding earpice in your ear is disconcerting for phone calls.  
i find i can't hear my own voice and have to take the left earpiece out to hear myself.
"still for the price, this is a solid option."
in the past year i have bought 3 pairs of these earphones on amazon
but i have definitely noticed a decline in quality during that time.  
first pair sounded great
but i lost them.  
"subsequent pairs have been flimsy and falling apart after a few hours of use, so they are obviously knockoffs that third party chinese sellers are allowed to sell on amazon—why?  "
i bought square trade protection last time as recommended by amazon.  
however square trade says they will not honor my claim for manufacture defect since these earphones are supposedly protected by panasonic with one year warranty.  
"and like others here, panasonic customer no-service was no help.  "
"square trade is not worth paying for on small fragile items like this, because you probably won’t have this item for a whole year.  "
i am not buying or trusting this panasonic product anymore!
dont waste your money
", these earbuds are horrible."
from the moment i put these earbuds in
i found them to be extremely uncomfortable & the sound is not clear.
since the description on the amazon website came with a satisfaction guarantee i felt reassured that this was a quality product & the reviews appeared to back this up.
i have never been more wrong!
these earbuds are not guaranteed nor are they returnable.
very disappointed in this product & will never purchase again.
buyer beware!
"these are pretty much on par with your average $20 pair of earbuds, my price at time of buying was $8.50.  "
i've never bought into extremely expensive earbuds
"but i've strayed into the $100 range before and wound up coming back to the cheaper side because i tend to destroy earbuds because i go to sleep wearing them and by morning they're usually pulled out of the headphone jack and somewhere in the bed, maybe under me having been rolled over 8 times."
i think if you went to your $30 sonys you would get better sound quality.  
"these earbuds aren't real ""boomy"" so if you're an edm enthusiast"
you just need to spend more to get satisfaction from earbuds.  
"at highest volumes they don't really sound ""accurate"""
"i guess is the word, some songs the bass notes are more than they should be and on other songs the higher notes get too noticeable."
"if you listen to a lot of audiobooks, or listening on an airplane or around people where you just want to hear your music but aren't turning it up particularly loud"
these are totally decent.  
a huge upside is these are quite comfortable and very low profile if you wear them in bed and have them in on your 'bottom' ear.
if you are hoping to really hear your music belted out and have a great musical experience then these aren't the earbuds for you
but you shouldn't be looking at sub $10 earbuds anyway.
these have about double the value as their price in my opinion.  
"comfortable, decent sound, very cheap."
"my stock headphones that came with my phone has finally been retired, and i was looking for a set to replace them."
"i was primarily looking for a set that would perpetually remain at the office, and not knowing is a sticky fingers might roam the halls, i didn't want to spend too much."
"after some searching, comparing other brands, i decided get these for that sole purpose."
"overall, i'm happy with the purchase, they're a decent pair of headphones for the price."
"i opted for the one without the microphone, since certain places at work would no allow them if they had a mic."
"i was skeptical about the whole ""ergo"" design of them, especially when i took them out of the package and noticed their weird shape, but those fears turned out to be unfounded."
"these headphones are comfortable to wear, more so that they any other in-ear pairs"
i owned over the years.
"i've owned some that felt more like earplugs, while these just rest in the ear without slipping out."
"i think it's this ergo, comfort fit"
", that might explain my only criticism with these, and that's the sound quality, they're muted sounding."
"my stock samsung headphones were quite loud, and i barely needed to have the volume high to hear sound out of them, these are the opposite."
the the quality of sound coming out of them is still good
", i find i have to raise the volume higher on phone just to hear what's being played."
"i'm not sure if this is normal for them, of a side effect from ""ergo"" design, but felt it worth mentioning."
"either way, i'm still happy with them."
"i go to the gym, cycle, run, etc - about 5-6 days a week, so i go through headphones fairly often, or they end up lost or damaged."
i am a little spoiled as the tj maxx near me sells skully candy head phones for 7.99 that i have been very happy with.
but it's located in a very traffic heavy part of town
i have not gotten too recently (nor do i want to around the holidays).
"so these were close in price and a name brand, so i figured i would give them a shot."
"i first put them in an they sounded kind of trebley and tinny, and i instantly new what the issue was"
(another review hit it right on the head in a longer explanation).
the biggest size of ear buds these come with don't seal my ear canal.
"with the sizes shipped, i could hear way to much of what was going on around me at the gym and not enough bass."
that seal you get when when you put them in the ear is when you get more full sound.
i swapped just the buds with another set and they actually are not at all bad.
"they have a little odd disc shape thing that sits in your ear to help keep them in, and the work well."
"for my ears, anyway, the weren't going anywhere - which ended up being a good thing since the buds were too small then again, with buds that fit properly, i do not usually have a problem with them falling out anyway."
"the only other thing i didn't like is they have the connector at a right angle, and it's quite bulky and square shaped."
it just barely fits into the area allowed for by my iphone case.
so if you have a larger more protective case- as many active people using iphones might-
this could be an issue for you (and i think they actually would be a pain for the arm band case i use for running outdoors).i
"guess if  i had been paying 15-20 dollars for head phones, i would be more satisfied with these for this price."
i have definitely paid more for worse.
"with the proper fit, they really aren't at all bad."
"but given the ear buds not fitting me and to a less extent, the jack being large and right angled"
", i don't think i would order these again."
hence the 3 stars.
update six days later.
the static in these are getting worse.
i can no longer play music on low because the static is louder then the music and voices.
"my one ear is developing a very sore spot, making it hard to put the earbud in."
the right earbud is magically working again but i would say sound quality is dropping fast.
have to wait till next paycheck and then getting
ear buds from a different company and
these are going in the trash can.
i read people complaining about no white noise.
they should have the earbuds i bought.
every times music plays there is annoying background noise.
it is like listening to old speakers that you know are dying.
i tried it on different devices and the noise it there all the times when sounds are coming through.
"also the second day i was listening to them, the right earbud will not play on my computer and it plays softer on my cellphone in the right earbud."
when i take them out after wearing them for a while.
the package was sealed
so i know i didn't get a used product
but they are very defective.
after i bought it i found out from other reviews that it has to be returned to panasonic instead of amazon and it cost more to send it there
then it costs...
i greatly regret this purchase.
"i was prepared to be underwhelmed with these, but i'm pretty impressed."
the sound quality is very good.
these are better than my headphones from sony.
the bass has depth & the highs are clean.
i listen to pitbull station on pandora when i work out & the songs sounded really good.
i've used my sony headphones with my phone for as long as i've had my phone & assumed the sound was as good as it was going to get due to my phone.
not the case at all.
"""don't let me down"", by chainsmokes ""don't stop the party"", by pitbull never sounded so good!"
the earpieces are made from hard plastic & the piece that goes into the ear is covered in a silicon type material which is pretty comfortable in that they slip in & out pretty well but don't slip out on their own.
the headphones come with a second set of silicon covers which is nice.
downside:
"the earpieces are labeled ""r"" & ""l"" but because the letters are very, very small, without my glasses on, it's really hard to tell which is which & in the gym, the lights aren't the brightest so it will be very difficult to tell which earpiece goes in."
the way i'll be able to tell is how they fit.
i purposefully put them in the wrong ears to see if i could notice the difference & i absolutely could.
"my plan is to put a spot of bright nail polish on the ""r"" earpiece"
so i'll know which goes where.
the other downside is the earpieces must be placed in my ears a certain way of
they make my ears sore after wearing them for longer than 30 minutes.
my typical session at the gym is 1.5 hours.
"as long as they are situated properly, all is well."
i know pretty quickly when they aren't sitting right
& they are easy to  move around manually but don't move around on their own so that is good.
the last bit that i don't love is the l shape of the pug-in end of the cord.
"if i don't push hard enough, my protective phone case impedes a proper connection & the music plays from my phone & not through my headphones."
"in the future, i'd love to see a straight jack end or a longer piece"
so it can connect without worry of the phone case thickness.
"overall take:for the price, these provide phenomenal sound quality."
"the ear pieces can be somewhat finicky, but that could also be my ears & not the overall take from the masses."
the silicon covers that slide into the ear are smooth & slide in easily but don't slip out.
the cord is long enough for the headphones to be in your ears & your phone can sit on the piece of cardio equipment without feeling too short or falling off due to too little slack.
would i buy these again?
absolutely.
"for those who are looking for a color other than black, these are perfect."
the headphones come in a lot of colors.
"overall, you are getting a great product & for the price, so far, these just can't be beat."
i’ve never been a fan of earbuds because they usually always end up disappointing at some point.
"so far, these do not disappoint!with"
"almost all other earbuds, i find that if they start out fitting nicely and working well, something usually breaks down; the fit gets messed up, which either degrades the seal between the earbud and the ear and reduces the sound quality by a lot, or becomes physically uncomfortable."
if not that.
not with these.
"with other earbuds,  there may be moments where the fit and sound are excellent ..."
"but then i cough, chew, smile, or do something totally normal, and at least one earbud slips out."
not with these.
"the sound quality, most likely due to the excellent seal within the ear, is exceptional for something at this price range."
"clear, rich sound, with decent bass!the weight is so slight, that i hardy feel them at all."
"they’re also relatively comfortable to wear while laying down, meditating, side-sleeping, etc."
"soon as i experienced these earbuds, i bought a second set, and a set for my mom."
excellent value!
"i bought a pair of these headphones 5 years ago, which gave me amazing audio quality all through my landscaping career into my programming career."
amazing durability on those.
"i thought i'd be able to get those again, but sadly, i plug these new ones in today and sound is barely coming out of on of the earbuds!"
i tried it in my laptops and my phones and it's the same problem.
very sad i used to tell everyone about my awesome panasonic headphones
now these are a total let down...
"the sound and noise cancellation was ok, nothing to really write home about."
mic worked properly.
"the grip was alright, as far as not needing to worry about them falling out constantly, even with some moderate movement."
"however, the cord was so flimsy it got easily tangled."
"unfortunately, these earphones lasted less than a month before one of the buds stopped working."
"also, when the earphones started to break down, it would also randomly pause and play the next song without pressing the controls."
"for the price, i was expecting better."
"quality is slightly better than a pair you would buy at a gas station, but lasts for about the same amount of time."
durability 5/5: bought these almost 4 years ago and they have lasted me extremely well.
i had a pair of samsung earbuds that came with my phone about 3 years ago and they eventually died about 2 1/2 years after regular usage.
"these earbuds, however, are very hardy and durable."
"i wrap them up a little too tightly, i admit, and there is absolutely no sign of wear and tear on the cord."
"the in-ear part is also very sturdy, taking a reasonable amount of jostling, and so far so good."
model 3/5
": it did take a lot of getting used going from the old, traditional earbuds to the in-ear style."
i have terrible sinuses and so i will never truly get over how they suction into your ear (
and when they get ripped out after having a good suction...awful!!).
"because of the in-ear, suctiony-ness, you will also get cord noise."
"as in, every time that you touch the cord or it rubs up against something, it will be very obvious and amplified."
this is unpleasant until you get used to ignoring it.  
"all of these things seem less about quality, and more just about getting used to this kind of earbud."
sound 5/5
": i'm not an audiophile by any means, but these earbuds have a really strong bass kick!"
quite good sound for the price!!!
"not tinny at all, not muted at all, not scratchy at all."
i'm very impressed with the audio that these cheap little things can push out!---edit:
"compared to higher end over-the-head headphones, i can tell that the bass is definitely boosted and the mids to highs are diminished."
"however, the overall sound is still clear."
"it's crystal clear sound, but with heavy base and the absence of some higher tones."
you won't notice that the highs and some mids are missing unless you're listening to stuff with heavier emphasis on those registers.
"but if you're really into strong bass, these will definitely do the job."
"comfort 4/5: once you get used to the in-ear aspect, these are actual pretty comfortable."
i ended up taking the rubber ends off and putting on different ones that fit into my ear better.
"however, the actual shape of the earbud, being slightly angled, allows it to rest in the ear quite comfortably."
just don't lay on your side with your ear squished into the pillow or that will be uncomfortable really fast.
overall
: 5/5.
i won't take off stars for my discomfort due to going inside the ear canal and then suctioning there because that is just how this kind of earbud works.
"i don't know what happened with these, but i will echo the other reviews and warn people that these have recently turned into pure garbage."
"i bought a pair just a few months ago and they were amazing for the price, now i buy a second pair so that i have one for work and another for home, and was immediately surprised by the terrible, electronic sounding sound."
you know how those old timie walkie talkies in movies sound?
yeah the pair i got sounded only a little bit better than that.
"their build quality is also much worse than my old ones; lighter, thinner, and cheaper feeling."
"i returned them and exchanged them for another pair, thinking maybe it was only that one pair that was faulty, but nope the replacement ones were exactly as bad."
"either panasonic is now outsourcing their construction to some cheap chinese 2 bit company, or the ones currently on sale are counterfeit."
edit:
"i bought a 3rd pair and they sounded fine, and had much better build quality."
only buy the ones that say
sold by
amazon.com.
the other sellers apparently buy shoddy chinese knock offs.
"priority sales, inc. especially seems to like undercut amazon slightly, but the ones they sell are complete garbage; that's the company my 2 previous pairs were from."
i only purchased these to listen to audio books or movies on my kindles.
the sound quality was good&the
ear buds were comfortable.
but they constantly tangled up.
then after only a couple of months one ear bud broke!
usually panasonic has very good quality products.
i can't even return them because they're only warrantied for 1 month.
bought a pair a few months back and was pleasantly surprised by the richness of sound.
"especially for the price, because it was very difficult to believe that such a product could come with such a reasonable price tag..."
fast forward to today...
unfortunately the older pair is finally starting to show age and feels like it'll finally he giving up tyebghost soon...
so i decided to buy a new pair...
the new pair came with a mic attached to the left ear peace instead of
"the right one (sure, no problem)..."
the sound was nowhere near as rich as the old pair.
i thought it was just a defective pair
so i ordered a second one to be sure.
nope.
still crap.
very disappointed.
i bought a set of these earbuds with microphone back in 2015 and loved them.  
they lasted a couple of years
and then i lost them.  
i bought another pair without the mic.  
my daughter has two sets.  
the one thing you can say is the audio quality is always excellent.  
i cannot believe the sound for such a small investment.  
"i love base, and the base comes through so nicely, but not in an unbalanced way."
"on my original set, i did notice over time that the mic quality decreased.  "
"so far, with this set, the mic is excellent.  "
"when i plug this into my iphone 7 (needs a little adapter which i have), my audio quality is much better than just talking on the phone itself, according to the other party.  "
every time.  
"if your friends ever tell you that you are sounding muffly, buy these ear buds (or go bluetooth"
but i like having it plugged in
so i don't have to constantly recharge them).  
"you will sound so much better to the other party, plus you get some serious sound quality."
"even though this last purchase was white, i also love all the color choices.  "
:)  
"my other pair (no mic) is orange, and they're great."
i use headphones to listen to asmr/meditation every night and usually fall asleep with them in so for me the biggest thing was finding something comfortable to sleep in.
i also have small ears
so i have a hard tome finding comfortable earbuds that fit and don’t hurt.
i had a cheap pair from a store that broke and they didn’t have them in stock when i went.
i started using the earbuds that came with my iphone but those are the most godawful uncomfortable things
ever-
i don’t know how anyone uses them.
so i found these for under $10 and figured what the heck.
they came today and i am very happy with them.
first pro the price of course.
at this price i wouldn’t be upset if i lost them or one of my kids/dog destroyed them or if they don’t last long.
second pro is the fit.
"as i said i have small ears, so i usually look for earbuds that come with multiple sizes and use the smallest ones."
"with these, the smallest ones are a actually a tiny bit too small."
"so parents looking for earbuds for kids, or anyone with small ears, these are a great choice."
third pro is comfort.
"they are surprisingly more comfortable than i expected and stay in my ear well without falling out or putting too much pressure on my ears, even when laying on side."
i haven’t worked out in them
but i think they would be good for that as they stay in and are comfortable.
fourth pro is the sound quality which is pretty good as well.
the noise cancellation isn’t great as i can still faintly hear my husband snoring
lol
"but i honestly didn’t have high hopes given the price, and that’s not really an important factor for me anyway."
all in all these are great.
obviously there are better high end headphones out there but those of us who aren’t willing to pay those prices these are the perfect choice.
they have two different qualities from the same product.
i bought one at the beginning that i was totally satisfied with the quality.
"around a month later, i ordered another one for my brother."
it turned out the new one has a really cheap quality and it doesn't work and have so many issues.
"my brother noticed that even the call answering button was on the left cord, usually it is on the right cord."
so i checked thepanasonic ergofit in-ear earbuds headphones with mic/controller rp-tcm125-w (white) packaging
and it turned out the packaging was different from the first one i got.
even the quality of the packaging was a cheap quality packaging.
"also, same products have different barcode numbers and different model numbers."
the cheap quality has an instruction paper that was in the packaging and most of it was written in chinese.
i'm totally disappointed since i felt that was clearly deception.
i ordered a replacement for the one i got
and i got another one with the same good quality.
that's where i believe that they are cheating on customers.
i purchased a pair of these earphones in december 2017 due to the overwhelming number of positive reviews.
"when they first arrived i was so happy with the sound quality, comfort level in-ear, and their ability to block outside noise."
"i use my headphones for schoolwork or to watch movies on my computer; i am by no means rough with them, i store them carefully, i'd had my last pair for 8 years, etc."
"however, only one month after purchase, the left earphone suddenly shorted out and ceased working."
i attempted to return them through amazon and was instead told to contact panasonic directly.
i tried numerous times to use the panasonic website's live chat support feature but kept getting a message that there were no employees on live chat at this time (no matter what time of day i tried).
i then called their 1-888 support number and the first thing the automated message warned me
was that i risked being charged a $9.99 service fee for help if i continued with the phone call
and if my product turned out not to be covered under warranty.
"given that i didn't know if the earphones were still covered under any limited warranty, i opted to just hang up at that point, write off my money spent, and order a second pair."
"they arrived on january 25, 2018, and again, i was satisfied."
"less than two weeks later, while watching a homework video, the right earphone suddenly shorted out and stopped working."
i called panasonic again figuring
that this time it had to be covered under some warranty at less than 2 weeks old.
the customer service rep sent me the e-mail instructions to submit my proof of purchase for both pairs
and i later received an e-mail back with the instructions for shipping the headphones.
"they stated that i was only allowed to ship the product in one specific type of corrugated cardboard container, that it needed to be  certain size of that container, and that i would need to pay for tracking and insurance on the product on top of the shipping."
the total amount for shipping cost
more than three pairs of these headphones
and they wouldn't guarantee that they would send me two new pairs to replace the two broken ones.
this is the worst experience i've ever had with a purchase from amazon.
"i was disappointed and frustrated that i could not conduct my return directly through amazon and have a replacement sent to me or my money refunded like is usually the case on amazon, but instead had to do the whole runaround with panasonic, and i still don't know whether panasonic will honor its warranty and send me two new pairs."
"based on the number of positive reviews for these earphones it seems like i did just get unlucky (twice) with defective pairs, however, if you're one of those unlucky ones you can count your money spent as lost based on the incredible hassle and lack of good customer service to make it right."
when i first opened these they fit very comfortable in my ears.
when i tried listening to them the sound in the right ear kept shorting out.  
went to amazon to try to return them and learned i could not return them even though i had just purchased them a few days ago.  
instead i was given the phone number to panasonic customer support.  
i was disconnected twice from customer  support while they tried to transfer me to the right person.  
i realize these headphones we’re only $8
but it’s
the principle of it that they make you jump through all of these hoops from the manufacturer to return a defective product.
normally amazon returns items quickly with little effort.  
given all of the positive reviews of these headphones
i am assuming i just got a defective pair.
update:  
i called panasonic to start a return.
they told me i would have to ship the $8 earbuds to them first
then they would fix them and send them back to me.
very disappointed as it would cost me at least that much to ship them in the first place.  
not a fan of panasonic right now and surely will never buy any panasonic headphones again.
"a couple years ago, i ordered five well-rated headphones at once to compare quality over price."
"these were the overall winner, and i've purchased several more over time."
"unfortunately, the latest batch is a completely different product."
either panasonic started skimping on production or these are cheap counterfeits (more likely).
i just plugged these into my electronic drum kit and literally could not hear the kick drum's bass sound at all.
"i thought my kit was messed up, but instead plugged in an older pair of these and noticed not only a clear rolling bass, but all of the sounds were much fuller and richer."
it's a shame that amazon isn't doing anything about counterfeiting.
the positive reviews here are outdated and worthless.
"if you're looking for a testament on durability, reliability, and fit, here's my experience with these earphones."
durability and reliability test - passed.
(four years of daily use and still functioning)been using this since 2012 during the day while i work to listen to music.
these are the only earphones i use that do have not an in-line microphone because it is not needed for my office work.
"this gets rolled and tossed into my bag every weekday, yet.."
"no tears, no loose wires, earpads in tact."
fully functioning.
sound still crisp and clear.
it can definitely stand the mild abuse.
comfort test - passed.
"the fit is perfect for my ears - very ergonomic as the bud rests nicely in the concha (bowl-shaped cavity) of the ear, cradled by the intertragal notch - like a snug hug."
"the earpads insert easily into place for a gentle cushioned feel, loosely 'locking' into place very naturally."
i've worn these for hours at a time without any aching of the ear or hint of tension
so the comfort is definitely there.
"i have also used them while walking, running, cleaning, and they rarely fall out - thank goodness!"
it's so bloody annoying when earbuds slip out!sound test - passed.
let's be real.
don't expect sennheiser quality audio on a earphone that costs less than popcorn at the movie theaters.
but also don't brush it off either.
the sound quality is rather good.
"to the average user, one most likely won't pick up the nuiances between amazing full bass, mid, or treble."
"these are definitely not bass-enhanced so don't expect these to pump out your favorite bass-powered beats to your liking, but they will do an acceptable job at nice highs and clear mids."
"general notes:because of the fit of the earpad into the ear canal, it does block out some noise."
"because i do use these for work, i normally just keep one of these earbuds in for the music while still being attentive within the environment."
"these earphones also do a decent job at keeping the audio 'localized', meaning if you are jamming music at full blast, the sound will leak from the earphones, but not too much."
i can be listening to music at a somewhat loud scale and no one around me can hear it at all.
comfort/fit comparison:i am an android user and faithful samsung galaxy series smart phone user.
i have the old samsung galaxy s2 earphones and the new samsung galaxy s6 edge earphones to compare comfort/ergo fit to.
you'll see in my picture the stark difference in overall shape of the earbud from just three earphones.
"yet despite my loyalty to samsung galaxy smartphones, the fit of their earphones are always terrible, even the latest s6 edge earphone accessory."
here is why the fit and comfort of the humble panasonic make my ears happier than most earpieces:- see samsung galaxy s2 earphones.
nice soft silicone gel earpad but poor earbud shape that doesn't 'lock' into place with the natural shape of the outer ear.
"thus, it frequently comes out like a loose, thick q-tip.- see samsung galaxy s6 edge earphones."
"better quality silicone gel earpad that attempts to cushion the supposed natural shape of the ear canal entrance, but utterly fails for anyone with normal sized ears."
"even with the smallest size gel earpads, the earphones frequently pop out and is very annoying."
"not only that, the gel earpads frequently loosen from the buds itself and falls off."
i got my s6
edge summer of 2015
and i have already used all spare gel earpads + another set of replacement earpads
"(if you look closely at the photo, i had to resort to a left earpad for my right earbud because i had no more replacement earpads to use)."
i am now down to a single earpad and am giving up on these stupid earphones in general.
verdict:worth!
four years on a product that works on a daily and fits great for price of $6-$10?
no brainer.
incredibly reliable and good quality.
i've had a love/hate relationship with these earbuds until i learned how to properly use them
(i've had them for a few weeks now).
"these are my first pair of in-ear earbuds and as many have already said, they are to be worn sealed into the ear canal to get the proper fidelity."
you cannot simply fit them into the opening of the ear and get any bass response at all.
i knew this but didn't know how you were supposed to get them inserted properly
and i struggled in the absence of any pertinent guidance.
i understand that everyone's ears are shaped a little differently but what i found that worked for me was to insert the bud into the opening of my ear canal and rotate it while applying inward pressure (kind of like turning a screw) until the cable/shaft points upwards
(see my pic).
when the bud is situated this way it slides into my ear canal and makes the appropriate seal
and i can run the cable behind my ear.
no amount of inward pressure could get the proper seal with the cables hanging downward like you would think it is intended.  
it took me a while to figure this out.
i also discovered that there is a fine line between pushing it in just enough to create the seal and pushing it in too far.
go too far and they begin to hurt rather quickly...
and they hurt pretty bad.
so find the spot where they seal but go no further.
"again, it took me a while to figure this out."
when positioned correctly i can wear them for extended periods.
"that being said, once fitted correctly - sealed in the ear canal - these buds provide an adequate (quite a bit actually) amount of bass and sound isolation compared to the regular headphones that simply rest in front of the ear opening."
the bass was too much at first.
i realized i had my eq settings on my device set to a high bass boost to compensate for my old headphones.
once adjusted to flatten out the bass they sounded fantastic.
i've never had any other high-end earbuds to compare these to
but i feel that these sound great especially for the price.
they do a very good job of keeping out surrounding noise.
i used them on a recent flight and they did a much better job keeping out the background noise of the jet than my old phones.
use caution when walking/running as they can block the sound of traffic and other hazards you would otherwise hear.
summary:
these panasonic in-ear earbuds are a great value and have exceptional sound... once you learn how to properly use them.
experiment to achieve the correct and comfortable fit.
i have purchased 3 pairs of these headphones - the first without a microphone and then two more with a microphone.
the non-microphone pair was really great - i used it for years before it finally gave out.
the microphone version seemed just as great
"and i loved being able to use them to make calls, pause and start my music, etc."
"however, after about a year the plastic piece covering the speaker loosened and detached."
i bought another pair and it only lasted a few months before the exact same thing happened.
i think they must be using less glue or something because the microphone ones are much less sturdy.
even though my second pair was still under warranty (i only bought it 2.5 months ago)
"panasonic refused to replace them because they were ""damaged""."
panasonic -
the damage is because of your faulty design!
"i am at work, next to the window, and there is a literal jackhammer outside the window."
"i have these headphones in, listening to music, and i can't hear it at all."
"if you want that in your life, these are the earbuds for you."
they've changed the style of these.
the previous style was fantastic.
"i tend to go through headphones due to a lot of abuse, but the sound was fantastic and had great bass and great at blocking out other noise."
ordered another set of 4 of these (again because i'm hard on headphones) and now the style has changed.
"thinner wire, less base, doesn't block out noise as well."
i fail to understand why when people have a winning product that they feel the urge to redesign the product and make it worse.
i guess it's to save money.
well they need to save their money because i'm certainly not spending any more of my money on these.
"excellent sound quality, affordable, comfortablethe"
"only downside is the pictures do not indicate the jack has a square-end cover, which prevents usage in some types of cases."
"if you are sure the headphones will fit in your phone, these are the ones for you!"
they sound better than some of the $20+ sony headphones!
i purchased a pair of these earphones in december 2017 due to the overwhelming number of positive reviews.
"when they first arrived i was so happy with the sound quality, comfort level in-ear, and their ability to block outside noise."
"i use my headphones for schoolwork or to watch movies on my computer; i am by no means rough with them, i store them carefully, i'd had my last pair for 8 years, etc."
"however, only one month after purchase, the left earphone suddenly shorted out and ceased working."
i attempted to return them through amazon and was instead told to contact panasonic directly.
i tried numerous times to use the panasonic website's live chat support feature but kept getting a message that there were no employees on live chat at this time (no matter what time of day i tried).
i then called their 1-888 support number and the first thing the automated message warned me
was that i risked being charged a $9.99 service fee for help if i continued with the phone call
and if my product turned out not to be covered under warranty.
"given that i didn't know if the earphones were still covered under any limited warranty, i opted to just hang up at that point, write off my money spent, and order a second pair."
"they arrived on january 25, 2018, and again, i was satisfied."
"less than two weeks later, while watching a homework video, the right earphone suddenly shorted out and stopped working."
i called panasonic again figuring
that this time it had to be covered under some warranty at less than 2 weeks old.
the customer service rep sent me the e-mail instructions to submit my proof of purchase for both pairs
and i later received an e-mail back with the instructions for shipping the headphones.
"they stated that i was only allowed to ship the product in one specific type of corrugated cardboard container, that it needed to be  certain size of that container, and that i would need to pay for tracking and insurance on the product on top of the shipping."
the total amount for shipping cost
more than three pairs of these headphones
and they wouldn't guarantee that they would send me two new pairs to replace the two broken ones.
this is the worst experience i've ever had with a purchase from amazon.
"i was disappointed and frustrated that i could not conduct my return directly through amazon and have a replacement sent to me or my money refunded like is usually the case on amazon, but instead had to do the whole runaround with panasonic, and i still don't know whether panasonic will honor its warranty and send me two new pairs."
"based on the number of positive reviews for these earphones it seems like i did just get unlucky (twice) with defective pairs, however, if you're one of those unlucky ones you can count your money spent as lost based on the incredible hassle and lack of good customer service to make it right."
they're legit.
"i know there's a lot of earbuds on amazon and most of them are too good to be true, but these came and with it a card asking for a positive review in exchange for some small free product."
"that explains all the one-liner 5-stars, but i'll tell you right now they sound fine, and the jack plugs in nicely to any device."
i don't care about the free product.
i purchased the vogek earbuds for $5.99 and the quality is awesome.  
i have spent hundreds on different earbuds that stop working in 2 or 3 months and bluetooth devices.  
"but, these vogek buds sound just as good, if not better in my opinion.  "
"the do not support volume control, microphone.  "
you can use your device to control the volume but there is a microphone
"and i can talk on the phone with these earbuds and everything, and the call clarity is just as good, if not better than my $300 bluetooth.  "
i bought these to keep in my purse on the days that i forget my device on the charger.  
if vogek has wireless earbuds
i will be buying them.
i was searching for a decent set of earbuds that were lightweight and required neither batteries nor the hassle of pairing.  
"since the price was right, i ordered a set from voget."
"they arrived quickly, packed in a small cardboard box.  "
the package included the earbuds and three sets of earpads.
"the earbuds are quite attractive, and the stress relief provided at the earpieces and connector ensures long life.  "
the cables are flat to minimize tangling.
these earpieces fit well and can be worn for long periods before they become uncomfortable.
volume—controlled by my mp3 player—can be adjusted quite loudly without distortion.  
sound quality is surprisingly good for an item in this price range.  
i would have no hesitation in purchasing another product from this company.
i’ve been getting skullcandy earbuds for like 7 years now because of the unmatched sound quality and comfort.
my last pair broke and i didn’t have $16 to shell out for another pair that would probably break in 6 months.
saw the positive reviews on these and although skeptical because of the price being almost half that of skullcandy
’s
", i decided to buy these vogek ones."
"started some music, immediately happy!"
i’ve never had ergonomic earbuds before so
the feeling is a little weird but not bad.
"as for sound, i would say these are a force to be reckoned with, a strong competitor for skullcandy."
love love love these!
"i can’t speak for the durability yet since i got them less than 10 minutes ago, but so far so good."
update:
"unfortunately, they have already stopped working in the left ear."
"the durability is next to none i suppose, since i never stepped on them or bent the wires weirdly."
i was looking for a simple and inexpensive set of earbuds for my child (with no microphone nor phone control) that she could use with her tablet in the car.  
"i found a nice set of “amazon’s choice” vogek earbuds for eight dollars, which led me to these through the “compare with similar items” panel.  "
"this version of the vogek earbuds seemed to have all of the same features as the other set, but were on sale for six dollars.  "
it arrived the next day and we immediately tried them out.
the 9 mm neodymium driver units do give these earbuds better bass than most earbuds you’d find at the store.  
"they have great quality sound – maybe not quite as good as my $50 earbuds, but as good as or better than any $20-$30 earbud i’ve bought in the past.  "
these also feature a “slim & extended 3.5mm connector” that allows the connector to go through the case cutout of your phone or tablet without getting blocked from fully seating.  
"i use bluetooth enabled earbuds, so this is a feature i didn’t even consider in the past and think it is worth mentioning."
these were love at first sight with my daughter
and i highly recommend these vogek earbuds.
"the headphones are very aesthetically pleasing, they even come with a tiny velcro wrap to keep them wrapped."
"while testing the sound, at the lowest volume on my phone"
"it sounds like a whisper, which it normal and fine."
and at the highest volume they perform wonderfully
", they block out all the noise"
and it's kinda like being at a real concert
"it's so loud, and if you take them out of your ears you can still hear the music clearly."
these earbuds are totally worth the ten bucks they are sold for.
one thing i will particularly note in its difference from other earbuds is the shape.
"i always get ergonomic, and these ones are more bent than normal."
"at first i was wary, simply because of the change from normality, but it really is just as, if not more comfortable than that traditional curved shape that many ergonomic earbuds are made in."
"concerning sound, it is actually a lot better than i thought it would be for the price."
"i tested them with a couple dozen songs from spotify, including heavy bassed songs."
"one thing i noticed is the nice quality in general, not just the bass."
i think part of that is due to the shape and outside sound-blockage.
"i bought two of them hoping they would be good, and they are even better than expected!one"
"last note: for me, earbuds don't generally last too long, more than 6-8 months at best."
"that is why ten bucks is awesome, because i don't want to spend 50 on earbuds that are not incredibly different in quality, if they are going to break (which happens every time for me)"
so soon.
it's only ten bucks.
try it out.
why not?
i just got these budget headphones and immediately tried them out.
i was expecting tinny sound or tunnel-sound considering the price.
i'm very happy that the headphones so far exhibit sound quality as good as that of headphones much more expensive.
"the tones seem accurate to me with respectable--but not cloying, exaggerated--bass."
these headphones work terrific not only for listening to movies but also music where sound fidelity is critical.
i also really appreciate the flat cord.
it really does retard tangling.
and the dual red-black color adds some pizzas to what could be another boring black headphone set.
i used the ear inserts already attached to the headphones and they're perfect for me.
very comfortable.
i don't anticipate any problems wearing these for hours.
"and while i don't expect to wear them while exercising, i think they'd be stable anyway."
"for sitting around working and listening to music, the ear pieces stay in without any of the annoying drooping of heavier sets."
and since there are no other gadgets on the headset--like active noise cancellation boxes or call-management systems--the whole set is very light.
i just turned the track i'm listening to on my iphone up 3/4-to-max.
"no crackling, distorting."
great!
"and the sound is still crisp, the silences between tracks enveloping."
"oh, and the set comes with a tiny (1.5 inches) velcro tie that's perfect for bundling the headset for travel--a very nice touch most other companies never include."
terrific price for a good set of basic headphones that perform surprisingly well.
i may just purchase another to keep as a back-up.
i didn't receive the brand i ordered.
"i received sopownic earbuds, not the vogek brand shown and described."
"these sound horrible, almost like mono through a long tin can."
no bass whatsoever.
"low volume and even though they're supposed to be tangle free, they get tangled due to the way they were packaged."
the high reviews are most likely due to the fact that if you rate them five stars they promise free stuff.
very disappointed in every way possible.
one ear stopped working before it was even a month.
i keep it in my cellphone (spotify) all day and my ipod on the weekends so it wasn't being too handled or tossed.
"while it worked, the volume was amazing, you dint even need to put it to max with how loud it is and the quality was good too..."
sucks that it had a short lifespan
i need a cheap set of earbuds for work.
i wear them all day
so they get a beating.
i'm not crazy about the red color but the cord is thicker and more solid which to me means it will last longer.
the spongy part that fits in your ear was too small for me and kept falling out
so i switched it out with the larger pair that came with it
and it's fine.
i prefer earbuds that go straight in your ear and these are curved slightly.
i assume that makes them more ergonomic.
so if you like that you'll be happy and once i'm used to it
i'm sure i won't mind.
for the price these are excellent and worth it.
if you want more high end earbuds then these aren't that
but the sound is still very good.
"i use it for work to hear voices, not music"
so i can't comment on that.
as i said the cord that runs to the plug is solid and slightly thicker than some earbuds so for me
it's better
but if you're looking for a cord you hardly know is there then this may be too thick.
my last two pairs had a thin cord.
i liked the lightness of it
but it was too flimsy and kept getting broken.
i'd rather have thicker and last than flimsy.
"however, if you're wanting to exercise with these you might want to consider putting them under clothes so the cord doesn't get in the way."
i bought these after buying similar-priced ear buds at walmart.
"the sound quality on the walmart buds was awful, even to my very-novice ears."
"but the reviews on these were good, so i figured it was worth a shot."
the bad (which is not awful): i don't love the color.
"and the buds themselves are at an unusual angle, and that's going to take some getting used to."
"but that's it, as far as i can tell, for the bad."
"the sound quality is certainly acceptable (again, i don't have a discerning ear, but i was able to tell the cheap walmart buds were bad)."
"the fit is fine, and it comes with two spare sets of ""pads"" in different sizes"
(i have not tried those).i have no hesitation in recommending these to someone looking for an inexpensive pair of earbuds.
"these are my second pair, my husband liked my set and requested a set for himself."
"like the sound quality for the price, tangle-free which is the first thing my hubby noticed, there is no volume control as they are just earbuds, so technically there should be a n/a for that section, hence the 3 stars."
"we did not want noise cancellation, but when in the ear, it's enough to suit our needs."
"we like the flat cord as it keeps it tangle-free, the earpieces are definitely designated left or right ear with a symbol on the earbud."
i however did not see it till
"months later, i just recognized by feel which bud goes in which ear."
"later i switched the silicone pieces to slightly smaller for my ear canal, replacing the right one with a white ear tip=""right, white"" and the left one is black= ""black, left""."
"simple, but it helped my brain decipher at a quick glance."
i usually expect the quality i pay for in a product.
these earbuds were a pleasant surprise compared to the price.
i experienced a sound quality that is usually attained in the upper range headsets.
i own the sony 1000xm3 and the bose 700.
i love them both
but neither of them feels as comfortable in my ears while i sleep.
the other good thing about these headphones is they will never die on you due to battery.
that's the reason why i wanted a wired set.
the unique design allows you to quickly identify the left vs right side
so you don't have to read the tiny font.
the cable feel strong and sturdy.
i dropped my phone
and i caught it by the cord
"like i was fishing, right before it hit the floor.  "
"if you are looking for a good set of wired earbuds for your kids or yourself, these are a must-have."
one con: please provide a larget earpiece over for people with larger earhole lol.
thank you.
you really can't beat the price.
"these are $6 earphones, but they feel like they cost $14."
i don't remember the last time i purchased something with such value!
"such fantastic quality, both in structure and sound."
i purchased this after my skullcandy broke.
"right off the bat, these feels much higher quality than my previous earphones."
the earphones are smooth and sturdy.
"i have a cat who loves to chew wires, so thanks god they aren't flimsy."
my only complaint is that the earbuds feel a bit heavy in your ear.
but i prefer it this way because these stay in my ears even when tugged.
the sound quality is fantastic.
"zero complaints here, just compliments."
the range of sound is amazing.
i can see myself using this for a long time.
i highly recommend these earphones.
i'm very happy with my purchase!
hopefully these brand continues developing these for a long time.
i found my go-to pair. :-)
"of all the headphones i had, this one takes the crown because it is tangle free."
"even if it gets tangled a bit, it's so easy to untangle it."
i have a habit of wrapping it on my fingers when i put it into my bag and that normally is bad for other headphones.
"i tried the same with this, and it was pretty easy to unwind and use it again."
i like it.
"sound quality is good, fits in well into my ears - i had to switch the foam plugs to smaller size."
but all is good.
so i finally decided to write a review after purchasing my 3rd pair of these.  
is there anything wrong with them?  
"no, i am just prone to losing earbuds or misplacing them"
so i've bought several pairs over the last few months.  
these are definitely the best bang for the buck for earbuds.  
"i've bought ""bargain headphones"" from name brands at the drug store and they sound lifeless.  "
"these earbuds produce a nice full sound, not too much bass and an even spectrum across all frequencies which is good for music and podcasts.  "
it's a great all around earbud.  
the flat cable is also nice to prevent tangles as i store them in my pocket
and they never knot up.  
i wouldn't expect audiophile quality
but you definitely get what you pay for
and then some.  
my only suggestion would be to make the l and r on the earbuds
more visible b/c
at first i had them reversed
and i could barely make them out.  
"overall, i'm very pleased and will probably be purchasing again once i leave another pair on the train."
i really like these earbuds because they are small.
i’ve bought many many pairs of buds that have huge ear buds and found them extremely uncomfortable.
these earbuds are small and very
comfortabledon’t know about noise cancellation.
"when i play music i can’t hear outside noise, so i guess they work."
i also appreciate the volume control
so i don’t have to control it through my phone
these are the best earbuds i have ever used.
they have a long cord to have my media in my pocket and not feel like the cord will pull out.
the ear pieces are soft and very comfortable with a good fit to help filter out any outside noises.
i purchased a set about a year ago and they are still working fine.
"i ordered back up pairs to leave at one at home, one in my office and one in my bag. ."
i have had fairly expensive ones and sent them all back.  
these were cheap enough to give it a try or discard without hassle.  
they seem to be as good as any of the expensive buds for 1/5-1/10th the price.  
"the sound is equal and they fit a little better, but not perfect.  "
i have small ear openings and have difficulty keeping any of even the smallest adapters in the ear.
"i liked the cord,it is as stated and does not tangle up."
the sound was hard to believe-
first i used a classic sony walkman and with reception not great and with held any opinion.
put an adapter on to use with my receiver for a true sound demo.
i was shocked!
i have purchased earbuds sounding much better from dollar tree where all products in store are $1.
i use these on the treadmill when working out at club exclusively.
last about 6-8 weeks then usually 1 channel drops out-spend another $1 and replace.
i read reviews of this product and decided i may be better off with an improved product.
this is definitely not it!  
will buy 6 pair from dollar tree next visit and while the way i use these sound is not that critical
i highly do not recommend these if you are listening to any kind of music.
they are terrible regardless
i ordered these based on reviews.
i love them.
i am a student and use them for computer use & my digital recorder.
i have small ears.
all the others i’ve tried over the years have not fit well.
they often hurt.
not these!
they fit great
👍 i used the smallest ear bud cover they came with.
very comfortable.
the sound is great.
the only thing i would change is to have a little longer cord.  
the cord stays flat & no tangles yet.  
i would recommend them.
they were delivered very fast.
amazon prime.
it’s an american company that sells them.
very very pleased!!!
i was looking for an inexpensive set of earbuds since my wife stole my expensive set
and i didn't want to spend $$ on a new set.
"when i found the vogek earbuds for six dollars, i thought these would be too inferior in terms of sound quality and construction."
i still ordered it
and it arrived the next day.
i was astonished to find that they have great quality sound (better than my expensive set
i felt -
but i'm not a pro).
they also are tangle free!
this saves me a ton of time (which i usually spend on untangling) and money!
i love these so much i'll probably get a back up
(if my wife slips these too)
"my kids are not so fond of the wireless bluetooth earbuds, so i always am looking for some of this kind.  "
great set!  
"they have a really rich, clear, clean sound, and the bass is wonderful.  "
"the buds are shaped different than most, almost a 'low profile' look to them, so they are a bit hidden away in your ears.  "
great purchase for the price.
my go to inexpensive
ear buds have always been panasonic.  
they have served me well but the strength/durability of the cord could be better.  
i saw this vogek set at an very attractive price and decided to try them.  
i have been very satisfied with them.  
the cord is very pliable and it appears that it will hold up well.  
the sound quality is good although i need the volume on high for a distinctive sound level with my hearing.  
i am so pleased with the price/value of these earbuds that i will order another set for back up.
"when i got these, there was some kind of short issue, so that if the cord was bent near the jack, sound cut out.  "
"i returned them, and the second pair has been fine, so it seems to have been just a random defect, and the earbuds themselves are quite good considering the price.  "
"i'm using them for podcasts, so i can't really evaluate sound quality, but they certainly sound fine.  "
"the cord for the right channel is red and black, where as the left is just red, so it makes it simple to identify which is which.  "
exchanging out the defective product for a new one was simple and painless.
i bought these to augment my wireless earbuds on long flights for when their battery would run out.  
"these things are pretty amazing for the price; there is no microphone, no independent volume control, and no noise cancellation, but they're not sold as such and i didn't need or want those features.  "
"just a comfortable, basic, high-sound-quality set of earbuds for primary or backup use.  "
"the cord is plenty long, too, which comes in handy when routing the cable to not interfere with seat belts and reach the phone storage or jacket pocket.  "
love em.
"it's been awhile since i've spent no more than one or two dollars at the dollar store for a pair of earbuds, but after my last pair broke i decided to spend a few more bucks for some that are of better quality."
"my only gripe with these is that they have a tendency to slip a bit when running, but have yet to fall out."
"otherwise, super impressed by the sound quality and material for being under $10."
these will be my new go-to when i need a cheap but nice pair of earbuds.
the sound quality of these earbuds are as good as any i have ever purchased.
i refuse to spend more than about $20 on earbuds because i am hard on them and they usually develop a short circuit or something within a few months of use.
i have only had these for about a week
but i truly appreciate the sound quality and they appear to be at least as rugged in construction as many others i have purchased an used in the past!
i purchased two pairs for this great price and will definitely keep them on my shopping list for future purchase as long as they are available!the
only reason i didn't give them 5 stars across the board
is because i haven't had an opportunity to see how long they will last.
"these ear buds are horribly uncomfortable, and fall out constantly"
( i've tried all 3 sizes).  
the sound is great though.  
but i can't use them because they are so uncomfortable.
i bought this earphone for my daughter.
she bought a new samsung galaxy note 10
+
and she want to buy another earphone for her new phone.
it is actually value for money.
my daughter said that the earphone sound quality is smooth and she love the sound quality.
this make me happy.
i am so happy with this purchase.
i super impressed by the sound quality with these inexpensive earbuds!
"you know the saying you get what you pay for, not in this case"
vogek went above and beyond my expectations with these awesome earbuds
the balance of sound between the not overpowering bass but just enough and mid range is excellent!
i highly recommend these thank you vogek for an excellent product at an very affordable price!
i hope this review helps and thanks for reading!

i received these earbuds a couple of days ago and they blew my mind.
"i saw the reviews and knew they were most likely going to be relatively good for the price, but actually experiencing the product made me so happy i made the choice to buy these.  "
"the sound quality on this pair of earbuds is very clear and consistent and even has very nice bass control, allowing me to turn it up to high volumes without hearing any deterioration sound."
"not only so they sound great for the price, but they also look pretty neat!"
"they may not have the volume/call control buttons on one of the wires, but that doesn't really bother me because they are only $6 and i don't need the buttons anyways."
"lastly, no matter how hard i try these earbuds either won't tangle, or untangle"
"whatever small tangled section easily, relieving any worry and annoyance that these earbuds will get tangled while having them in my pockets."
"these are amazing for the price, beating out even some $20 earbuds"
i've purchased in the past!
highly recommend!
i always have trouble with ear buds.  
they always hurt  my ears and never seem to fit right and always tangle up in my purse.  
"when i received these in the mail, and they came sooner than expected, i opened then and tried them out.  "
the sound was very clear and full and wow fit my ears very comfortably.  
was exactly what i wanted.  
i am sorry that i spent so much money on items like this that always either got tangled in my purse and quite working or hurt my ears so much it wasn't worth using them.  
i highly recommend this product.  
and will order again
so i can just leave each device with its own set.
i was a little unsure about ordering these as i usually don't use earbuds.
"but headphones can be a bit on the bulky side, especially if you want music while going out for a walk/jog."
"these little earbuds produced a surprising amount of sound, and were quite clear."
there was no problem with them staying in my ears as the earbuds themselves are angled a bit.
"the padding that was on the earbuds by default fit my ears just fine, but the box does include a couple of different sizes to accommodate different people."
"overall, i was happily impressed with the sound quality of these earbuds."
plenty of cord is given
so i never felt as though i was pulling them out of my ears.
"and i must say, the red and black color scheme of the earbuds is a rather sharp touch."
will probably pick up another pair at some point!
these are great little ear buds.
the only things that dropped the stars down are the facts that the cord does get tangled (not often but enough to frustrate the person i got them for) and the fact that with prolonged use (which he has to use them in school on a computer) they begin to irritate the insides of his ears from wear against the skin.
other than that great sound and clarity and amazing bass.
these ear buds are better than my bose which broke after 10 months of use.
i love the flat wires.
they tangle much less than the bose.
the shape and size of the ear buds are actually noise cancelling unlike the bose.
"the sound quality is not as good as the bose, but that's what you get when you pay $90 less for these."
i can't speak to the durability of these.
i've only had them for 2 weeks.
to qualify my review let me say i have a degree in communications and background in recording engineering and sound reinforcement.
these earbuds are solid and very good for casual listening.
"no they are not studio grade phones or sound cancelling, but for the price they do as advertised"
and i am pleased with the product.
"let's see how they hold up over time, but for a first listen out of the box they are very good."
turned out to be crap.
plastic earbud piece broke on its own.
"sound quality was fine, but material failure makes this product junk."
i bought these for my wife for her birthday.
she is very particular about headphones.
so far she loves these headphones.
"these ear buds fit her ears perfectly and they didn't bother her piercings at all, nor did the headphones dig into her ear once she had them in."
"the sound is equal from left to right, which is note worthy because akg brand headphones were off and she has had 2 sets of the akg.  "
i didn't rate the volume control because these are the baseline headphones and there is no mic or buttons which is what i wanted to get.
the flat cord is also really nice because my wife was the queen of picking up her headphones and they were always a knotted mess.
i was even impressed with the sound quality of these headphones for the quick minute i tried them out.
i will try to remember to do an update in a few months.
i love these new ear buds.
"they're small, fit well, and the sounds is great."
i have a problem with my ear canals so
"the right one is sometimes swollen, but the ear bud works just as well sort of perched at the entrance."
i really love that i have more little rubber covers as well.
i wasn't expecting that.
now i can keep them clean.
really affordable!
"i'm using them with my desktop, laptop and phone!"
i just needed good ear buds for my mp3 player - one without a mic (which for some reason are always too muted to hear from my player).  
these fit very nice in my ears even when running.  
i wasn't sure how 'tangle free' the flat cord would really
but it does work well.  
it comes with a small velcro strap which also makes it easy to pack up in to my bag.  
for the price i couldn't be happier.
i bought two pairs of these.  
one for me and one for my daughter.  
i love the great bass and the noise canceling of these ear buds.  
they’re very comfortable also.  
i use these for work and at times it’s very noisy
and they work great.  
the bud comes in three different  sizes.  
in the picture the buds look round and they are.  
the part they fit on is oval and that gives them the comfortable shape.  
if i need some more i will be buying these.
daughter:
"first of all, i love the price."
"when it comes to physical construction, i like how the actual bud fits in my ear, as well as the convenience of the flat wire."
"the sound is very smooth, clear, and they put out great bass."
i've never had earphones that are better quality!
they have lasted for so long -  longer than any of my previous headphones have!
they're also sooo comfortable
you can't even tell you're wearing headphones!
i can't believe that these are so cheap!
"they're the price of any walmart headphone, but so so so much better quality!"
the sound is also amazing!!
love them!!
"had to get them as a birthday present, too!"
"we were skeptical about the price but the reviews were good, so we took a chance at them."
i'm glad we did.
"these sound great and the quality, specially where the flat wires meet the buds or plug is superb."
i like how the flat wires prevent tangling and how they lay flat against the ear lobes...
cool design right there !
they are also super light!great buy.
"sound isolating and the clarity is awesome, love the base"
", i'm so impressed with the quality of these!"
you do get extra soft rubber ear covers in various sizes!
my wife used them for watching a movie and said she liked them better than her big expensive head phones.
she could hear what they were saying more clearly
and i agree!
the quality for the price is awesome.
i work at a computer all day and like to listen up music and podcasts without bothering my co-workers.
these earbuds are great.
i've been able to leave them in all day without noticing they were there.
there's a thigh plastic wedge wedge behind the bud that helps keep it in your ear while the rubber bud that sits in the ear is soft and comfortable.
sound quality is great for the price.
the flat cord it harder to tangle as well.
hard to beat for this price range.
these headphones were great until they started acting weird.
"they started only working if you position them in the headphone jack in certain ways, and would play sound badly if they weren't."
"unfortunate, because i really liked the comfort/quality until that point."
"they let me exchange them for a new pair though, so hopefully it was only this pair."
great pair for great price!
we go thru headphones like crazy in my house.
teenagers and lets face it adults
too lose them break them and leave them everywhere.
so i always grab a few inexpensive pairs here and there for the price these are a great pair!!
pleasantly surprised how well they work!
plus if they do break or get lost not so bad for the price !
"i order these vogek in ear headphones and first off, they came fast, and second they where packaged well."
the earphones have a curve
so they feel comfortable in your ear.
they gave me extra earbud cushions so that is good for people who find it hard to keep earphones in there ears while traveling.
the earphones never fell out my ear while traveling and moving around through the crowded train stations and mall.
they sound great and can cancel out noises in loud areas.
i would recommend these to anyone who is looking for inexpensive earphones.
i needed new earbuds for my daughter for school because the cheap walmart ones keep breaking.
i figured that these ones would have been similar quality
but i was wrong!
they have a feel and quality to them of something that i would expect to pay mire for.
the sound is good and it comes with a nice velcro strap to control the length.
it works with her school ipad and comes with different sized ear pieces.
the cord itself is actually resistant to tangling because it is flat.
good purchase!
"i needed a simple, comfortable set of earbuds for use on job sites where bluetooth is not permitted for security reasons."
it allows me to listen to instructional videos or conference calls and get the information i need to form an action plan in the data center.
they do a pretty good job at blocking out outside noise and the sound produced is clear.
"in all honesty, for $5.99 you get such quality sounding earbuds."
"there is no distortion or any signs that tell you this $5.99, the quality is there."
not best because it's $5.99
"but it's very well put together, especially the comfort in the ears."
it comes in this cigarette sized cardboard box and
in it are some ear tip changers (different sizes).
"for $5.99, you get crazy value for the money, should definitely consider purchasing these."
especially if your earbuds don't last more than 6 months.
highly recommend this one.
edit:
"as of november of 2019, they have broken on the left side."
it has only been 2 months since i have had them
and they already died on one side.
3 stars just for this.
these earbuds sound exceptionally good for the price!  
i am pleasantly surprised by the more expensive sound of these buds.  
the highs are not muddy nor are they non exsistant.  
the mid range is a tad low but acceptable.  
the bass is quite good depending on the music being listened to.
all in all i am happy with my purchase.
i was surprised when these arrived.
the speakers in the buds are angled horizontally about 30 degrees.  
"they don't fit like average earbuds that go straight in, these angle towards the front when they are in your ear.  "
the sound is pretty good.  
the only thing i was not completely satisfied with was the rubber pieces that hold them in your ear and makes them relatively noise cancelling were not big enough.  
it comes with three sets and none of them were big enough to make a good seal.  
i ended up using the pieces from an older pair of earbuds to make them work.  
"overall, a pretty good set of earbuds for the money.  "
7.5/10.
so i bought these headphones because my old ones crapped out on me.  
"i really only use them when i'm in the library, listening to study music.  "
"at first, i was a little bummed that they didn't come with a volume control on the cord.  "
"however, the sound quality for the price is awesome!  "
i have them in a pocket with the apple earbuds that came with my phone
and i prefer these to them.  
"if you're looking for a low priced headphone for basic use that puts out qality sound, these are them."
i have a daith piercing and majority of earbuds
i have tried do not stay in place.
the design of these earbuds are what made me consider buying with the hopes of one earbud not falling out every minute.  
after 4 days of use it has not fallen out at all!
great quality & affordable as well.
more than what i expected and am pleasantly surprised!!!
i really expected these to be another crappy pair of earbuds  
that last a few weeks
but i really enjoy these.
the sound quality is amazing.
the design on how these sit in my ear makes the quality of sound even better.
like every other pair of earbuds
these come with different size rubber pieces and putting the right ones on the earbuds changed the noise cancellation.
over all i recommend these for everyone.
i’ll be buying some more soon!
thought i didn't like them
but when i changed the rubber tips the fit was better and the sound quality was good.
bought because they are supposed to be more durable...we shall see.
these are great earbuds.
amazing great sound.
my skull candy ear buds finally died
so i tried this brand.
i could not be happier with this purchase.
"going to buy another pair, in the event i lose these earbuds."
shipping was fast as well.
i highly recommend this product.
one bud/wire shorted out already.
i do not recommend!
let's be honest before anything else.
"these are $10 earbuds, keeping that in mind i give you my review:i bought these for my ""pre-teen"" (her words) daughter."
she actually really likes them a lot.
"according to her they are ""a lot more powerful than the ones i had before"" and likes how they sound."
i like how thick the cord is.
her only problem is that they aren't that comfortable when i go to sleep with them in.
"i told her good, you're not supposed to be sleeping with earbuds in."
for the price heck
yeah
i will buy them again!
i skeptically bought the vogek  earbuds on sale for $5.99
-  thought i'd try them out instead of shelling out double the money for my usual ones.  
"was pleasantly surprised at the quality, comfort and chord color change for the right ear bud for easy id."
would recommend these earbuds to anyone for everyday use without the fear of wasting your money.
i would certainly say that these earbuds are worth the price!
"after looking for a pair of earbuds at a low cost to use for a trip (i needed some quickly for a long trip across california), i ended up settling on these pairs of earbuds, praying that they would be good for the price that i found them at."
"luckily for me, i was pleased to find that the earbuds were decent in quality in comparison to others around the same price."
"although i do not see these earbuds lasting me longer than a year (due in part to my bad habits), i am still glad that i was able to find this one at a low price."
so far so good.
these little  earbuds are working out really well.  
i haven't had any trouble with tangling either which i didn't expect.
good sound quality.
"i have slept with them in my ears a few nights, but was not bothered by them (perhaps because of they way they are angled off) like other harder earbuds."
a great little purchase!
i love that there is not a microphone on them
so i do not have the problems with that.
the sound quality is excellent and very clear.
i use them for mowing the yard plugged into a little portable arm band radio
"and i do not have to crank up the volume on these like i do with other kinds, especially when i put on the larger soft rubber tips.  "
"there is also an insert angle to them that i like, it helps to keep them nestled in my ear.  "
i will be buying more of them to use with my roku tv remote.
"while i was a little concerned about how the sound would be, i wanted the tangle free flat wires and didn't want to spend a fortune."
"well, i needn't have worried; the sound is great, far superior than the low price would indicate."
the quality seems great and i very happy with my purchase.
"these earphones proved to be everything i expected them be, and then some."
for a product so low budget
"i wasn't expecting the sound to be as good, especially when it came to cancelling out noise from the surrounding environment."
the bass of the earphones are fair for the price.
"it’s not ideal, but for $6.00 you can’t complain."
"i can’t much for durability, but looking at these earphones makes me wonder if they will make it through the week."
"on the other hand, i’ve had cheaper built ones that have lasted"
so i have faith.
"all in all, if have a low budget but want a good set of earphones, get these."
it’s been with it so far.
the no tangle feature seems to work well.
"not sure about long term durability, as i just got them."
the rubber earbuds  are to soft and flimsy and although 3 pairs are included they are almost the same size.
i swapped out for a better fit with some spares that i had.
"at first i really liked these headphones, but after 2 months only one ear bud works."
i was happy with them up until that.
"they sounded good, and i liked the no-tangle feature of the cord."
but the life span of these headphones should have been so much longer than that.
i will not be buying this brand again.
"they still tangle up, but are easier to untangle."
"the sound quality is fairly good, and the design is good as they fit into your ears better than most of the generic mess that's out there."
so...they are not perfect of totally tangle-free but they're better than most.
i love these!
comfortably fit and stay in ears.
the red color makes them easy to find in my bag--they don't disappear into the black bottom like my last earphones.
price is a great deal.
note that these don't have an on/off switch or volume control
--you still have to do that on your phone.
i really like these headphones.
"i wasn’t expecting much for them, but they are great."
sound is good.
i love the red/black color combo.
comes with multiple earphone replacements so that one would definitely fit your ear.
would buy again
i'm surprised at the quality of these $6 earphones!
ok then.
"i need another pair for traveling, so i'm ordering a second pair for my husband."
"just got them, so not sure how it will last, but we will see!"
i changed the size to small to fit my ear and they are very snug.
recommend.
saw the good reviews and ordered.
"like others have said, the sound quality is fantastic for how cheap it is--bass in particular comes through much clearer than even more expensive models i've tried."
noise cancellation is also unusually good if that's what you're looking for.
"the earbuds are comfortable and durable, and come with four (!!)"
extras in case you lose them.
"the one thing i wish was better was the cord, which is rather thick:"
"every time i jostle it by accident, the vibrations are amplified quite a bit through the earbuds, and makes things like running/"
exercising in these less ideal.
"still definitely recommend for studying, relaxing, etc."
a pretty decent product.
"especially for this price range, i would say this product is completely worth it."
"i was expecting some cheap stuff that would break before i touch them, but the quality turned out to be very nice."
the cord has a decent length and doesn't get tangled easily.
the sound quality is as good as something that would cost you twice the amount of money.
"overall, i am very satisfied with the product."
i am extremely picky when it comes to headphones.  
"these are amazing, they fit perfectly, the sound quality is great, and they're super soft so it doesn't cause any discomfort."
"i've used these since they arrived yesterday, almost non-stop, and couldn't be more happier.  "
i'll be buying more of these for my family for the holidays!
"they're incredibly poor made, even for the price."
"i ordered two pairs, the first got caught on a kitchen drawer knob and literally tore apart."
fair enough.
the second pair blew out randomly after just two weeks.
"first the left earbud, then the right."

install flash player i am rating these according to their price.
they are what i expected and do their job just fine.
everything about them from the sound quality to the tangle-free cable are acceptable.
"i do especially like the shape of the ear buds themselves, they are angled to enter the ear canal a bit better."
perfect.
exactly what i needed for the gym to plug into the aerobic machines
so i can watch tv while i workout.
the earbuds fit nicely into my ears and do not fall out.
i have had issues with other earphones falling out.
great purchase!
luv everything except same problem as always.  
can't seem to make the earbud stay in my ear.  
keeps slipping out after maybe 3 or 4 min but will not complain about that because it's a problem i've had with all of them.  
am very pleased
"i got this headphones due to low price and reviews, they broke after 2 days and now only 1 earpiece works."
just by a 11$ pair
1)
"as advertised, they do not tangle2)"
they fit well and come with various sized rubber inserts for people with various sized ear holes.3)
wire and connections seem more durable than other
comparably priced products.4) ear bud shape is weird but it enables the a better fit
and i've gotten used to it.
"also, it stops you from putting the wrong but in the wrong ear."
"these have a nice shape to the ear pieces and come with a choice of small, medium, or large foam pieces."
they plug into my android phone and the machines at the gym just fine.
they seem well made enough.
"the sound quality is fine -- a real audiophile would probably find it lacking, but they're probably paying a lot more for their earbuds."
these earbuds are very comfortable to wear and they do a great job of canceling out outside noise.
i like that the cord has its own velcro cord keeper to keep the cord wrapped up when not in use.
does a great job of not getting tangled.
i would definitely recommend this earbuds.
great but for just under $10.
the sound is great and they are more comfortable than i expected or have had before because they come with 3 different sizes of ear pieces...
"small, med and large."
i have small ear canals and the smaller ear pieces are perfect!
pros: one of the best earphones in the price range.
offering unbelievable quality below 10 bucks.
noise cancellation is good because of the perfect fitting in ears.
bass is very good and built quality is very good.  
its sound quality is superb .
it has deep bass and good treble.
i would say its all rounder value-for-money earbuds.
cons:
no cons considering the price range.
i have used various earphones and headphones but these earphones are one of the best that i have tried in this price range.
surely go for it without any second thoughts.
"i was originally skeptical of the quality of these earbuds due to the pricing, but was convinced by the multitude of positive reviews."
apparently wrongly so.
"one side stopped working within a week of purchase, and the other a week later."
1 star for great sound quality and a comfortable seal in the ears though.
disappointed these didn’t last longer than i originally hoped.
"i have been using them steadily for two weeks, and they have held up to a lot of testing."
"they are difficult to get tangled, which is nice."
they carry sound nicely.
"my only complaint is that it takes a while for them to start playing sound when i first plug them in, and start a video; but that is like a 5 sec."
delay which is not that big of a deal.
i ordered this product twice.
the first one was
defective bec
the left earbud is not working
"but they replace them immediately and received the product after a day, i was impressed its that quick."
"i tried it and it surprised me, the sound is awesome and it feels like it has a noise reduction too."
its comfortable to use for long period of time.
"i will use this for travel, gym and work."
amazing product for its price.
will recomment this.
"these headphones are really great, especially for how inexpensive they are!"
i read the reviews and figured i'd give them a shot because my other ones had recently broken.
"i've gone running with them a few times and they stay in place, the sound is excellent and they're comfortable."
this fits my ear perfectly.
it is like they measured my ear and placed it in.
so comfortable.
the cord doesn’t get tangled because it is well made.
can’t beat the price on these head phones.
i use them on my jet blue flight.
awesome
"maybe i got a bad pair but these ear buds has poor sound quality, you have to have your phone volume turned to 60-70 % to hear"
"and i'm not one that plays audio that loud, so if you like to jam music"
you'll be pretty disappointed with these buds.
but they're cheap!
i purchased these for my commute and travel and they work perfectly.
i love how easily they fit yet
how sturdy they are when  i toss them in my bag.
i also love the sound quality!
these are an affordable and awesome purchase!
i recently broke my in-ear headphones at the gym.
"naturally, i was shopping around on amazon and after a couple of searches, i discovered vogek."
i acquired this pair and they are super slim.
"in addition, they are slick and comfortable to work out and when you put want to put it away"
you do not have to worry about folding or tying a knot.
vogek includes a velcro strap and makes this process super simple.
it is inexpensive and actually worth more.
very happy with my purchase!
great earbuds for the money!
the fit is unique because the actual bud that goes into
"the ear is at a slight slant, so they stay in great."
i'll capture what i mean in a photo.
"my 7yo stole them from me, so that says alot!"

i got these earbuds for my son as a gift for when he uses his tablet or phone.
i tried them first to see how they worked.
they are very comfortable and the sound quality is crisp.
they even come with extra replaceable buds.

these are a high quality set of ear buds at a great price.
love the different size tips that come with them to insure they fit well.
use them to listen to music when i work out and the sound quality is excellent.
they fit well and keep the outside noise out.
am planning to get another set to take when i travel.
the flat cords really do help keep from tangling.
quality product!
good sound but not the most comfortable in the ears.
also it's almost impossible to  change the buds!
lost one when it popped out of my fingers
so i took one off of my old ones that had a missing bud.
these are great headphones!
this was actually my 2nd purchase because i like them so much.
i have bought more expensive name brand  more expensive headphones in the past that were of inferior quality to these.
the sound is great.
i love the tangle free flat cord.
"i use these headphones for listening to audio books while walking my dogs and doing work around the house, so they get a real workout."
"the purchase price is awesome, much cheaper than i would expect for the quality."
i won't be buying any other brand in the future:)
nicely designed earbuds.
comfortable with 3 different size earpads to customize.
very clear sound across the range.
"no volume control, use phone controls to adjust, but has a built in microphone.  "
"i don't why i am impressed with the little touches, but i really like the small and nifty velcro strap included for binding the cord."
"great black friday deal, as well."
they are fantastic when it  comes to not getting tangled.
all ear buds should be made with this material.
the ear buds do have a problem when it comes to staying in the ear; this is a poor design.
i am using these earbuds with a small mp3 player that uses  internal storage.
the player isn't real expensive but the ear buds made a real difference in quality.
great ear buds for the price.
buds quit working 2 weeks after return window closed.
these headphones are solely used in the gym for me.
they stay on your ear perfectly and the sound level is perfect to drown out the noises from other people and machines in the gym (along with the horrible music they play on loud speakers at the gym).
i bought these to wear under my helmet while riding my motorcycle for a safety course.  
they needed to be low profile and comfortable.  
these are both.  
the sound is solid and clear as well.  
good purchase
i bought these because the apple earbuds are too big for my ears and keep falling out when i run.
these work perfectly and do not fall out.
"sound quality however, is meh."
they do not have a good base like the apple earbuds.  
"and of course, they do not have volume adjustment capability --but  "
i knew that when i bought this.
"price point, they are good and fit smaller ears perfectly.  "
"if you want a good base beat with your run, they will do nothing for you."
these earbuds are some of the best available at this price-point.
the design is nice and the earbuds are very comfortable.
i was able to wear them for two hours straight no issue.
you also cannot get much better sound than these provide for the price.
definitely recommend these to anyone looking for earbuds.
these are my favorite ear buds!
"they are the cheapest i found, so i wasn't sure, but went for it."
"the sound quality is as good as my more expensive ear buds, but they do not get tangled up!"
i have bought several pairs ranging from inexpensive to over $100 and these are my favorite.  
sound quality is very good but the best aspect is that they are very comfortable and don't pop like the other buds do.  
i bought two pair.
"i actually like the product , for now i will give it 5 stars because for a week now it has been working perfectly ."
"it is really loud which is why i like it , the only thing is the volume control keys missing ."
"i hope they improve on that next time , the volume control keys would have made it really beautiful .another"
"good thing is it being light weight and not tangling every time , overall it will do the work ."
i will review it months for now concerning the durability .
these earbuds are the best value i've seen in a long time!
they sound great for their price point and the cord feels very durable.
"yes, there are better earbuds on the market."
"but for under $10, these are an easy must-buy!"
the speaker sounds fine.
the product is junk.
the wire are bad at the phone jack.
so the sound comes in and out.
you have to bend the wire around the phone jack to get sound back.
this happened on first use on them when i was cutting grass and phone was in my pocket.
"these are the first headphones i've had that absolutely do not tangle, it's"
amazing!the sound quality is great and they fit perfectly in my ears and don't fall out at all.
they're also decent priced too.
i highly recommend these headphones!
this is truly the best and most affordable headphones i've ever gotten.
"i'll be sure to order a few more of this soon, as backups."
the sound quality is perfect and real loud.
i love it ^^
sound quality is on par with what you would expect at this price point.  
there are certainly higher quality earbuds but not in this price point.  
lightweight and comfortable.
"very well made, and they actually stay in your ears."
the flat wires don’t tangle like the round wires.
i recommend these highly if you’re looking for good earbuds.
"i've purchased about 8 of these, kids lose or they are broken by mistreatment.  "
"i've had fairly expensive earbuds before, but the quality and price of these have saved me real money.  "
chords are a nice length
"and i like the shape of the ""handle"" on the ear part.  "
also like the flat chords that tend to stay straighter than most.  
definitely one to try considering the price.
previously purchased a pair of ear buds at a fitness center and paid more.  
they were poor quality and poor sound.  
these ear buds are excellent!  
quality is excellent and the sound is great.
these are very comfortable and have fantastic sound!
"i have fairly small ears and have had a difficult time in the past finding comfortable headphones, these are great!"
the product was exactly what i needed.
the earbuds produced great sound quality while running and stayed in place within the ear which is great!
nice product.
wow
these r awesome
the bass sound no noise
what a great buy for the price sure wish they came in black
but i still give 5 stars i tried to go on line for free product
i wanted the panasonic ear buds
but it wouldn't let me do it
we bought these for my son for school.
they have been great for him!
he is 10
so the fact that it came with different size
ear pieces was great.
the sound quality is good too!
i've already owned an airpods v2
so i only need additional cheap earphones to use with nintendo switch lite.
i bought this one because it's cheaper compared to others.
it exceeds my expectation: the wire is flat and sturdy (much better than the more expensive panasonic rp-hje120-k which has thin wire); the sound quality is great and it even includes extra-size eartips in the box.
totally recommend!
i ordered these since my old ear buds tore.
these do not disappoint!
"great sound quality, for such an amazing price."
will definitely order again if i need to.
i bought these earbuds because the colors match my phone and case and
i lost one piece of my bluetooth earbuds.
i wore them while jogging.
they didn't come off and the wires didn't get tangled.
the wires are actually thinner than i expected.
the sound is good while listening to music on my phone.
"the price is cheap, $6."
these were more than half the price cheaper than the over the ear wired headphones i looked at.
"bought this ear buds for my nintendo switch, and i really love it."
"it doesn’t make me feel overwhelmed for my ears, and it’s sounds quality is fine as well."
this ear buds perfectly fit my needs.
i got these earbuds because i often throw my headphones in my purse and they get tangled and sometime the wire gets pulled apart.
these headphones do not get tangled easy and if they get a little tangled they are easy to untangle.
"they are also very durable, so i can assume they will last a long time."
the sound quality is good for the price.
i use these for my iphone.
"overall, i am very satisfied with purchase and would recommend."
i needed a cheap pair of headphones.
i ordered these
"and wow these do not sound like a ""cheap"" pair."
the sound is great and has bass.  
i was pleasantly surprised.
used very sporadically for 2 months and one ear piece is dead.
ones from the dollar store last longer!
i do have to say the ear piece is comfy.
oh well.
i live the anti-tanfle design.
these don't get stuck in knots like my old ones.
sound is awesome and they fit my pocket radio.
great color too.
really nice headphones for the price!
i’ve always had trouble getting in this shaped plugs into my ears but this was pretty okay.
recommend!!
the earbuds are great.
the sound is clear and they fit great after i changed to the smaller size.
since i have an iphone i had to use my adapter for the earbuds.
but overall this was a great buy.
"earbuds constantly activate the assistant on my phone, making them useless."
"sound quality is passable, but they are very cheaply made and assuming they don't arrive broken like mine did, are unlikely to last very long."
"also, let it be known that this company gives out free products in exchange for reviews."
"not necessarily shady, but the potential is there."
i was hesitant to buy headphones off of amazon without seeing it testing them first
but these are amazing!
right out of the package the sound quality is phenomenal and not just only for 9.99 headphones.
they are noise canceling and fit in you ear perfectly without having to keep pushing them in to get the best sound effect.
i highly recommend these ( coming from a person who has to have lots of bass and good sound quality)
these are a solid 9/10!
i like the earbuds really well.
they fit good.
they are clear.
just wish they were a little louder.
but for the price they are great.
i use them at work.
these are absolutely perfect!
if you dont need wireless headphones these are basically nice cancelling.
i was surprised that i could barely hear my leaf blower and my volume wasn't even 100.i also love i can just throw these in my bag and
when i pull them out there's no mess!
i got these for my child's school use after going through several sets of cheap earbuds within a few weeks.  
"these are well constructed, with heavier/thicker wire than usually seen with earbuds in this price range.  "
"my child is very happy with them, and says they sound good also."
"after using the earbuds for the last two months, i have been impressed with the quality.  "
"the sound has been quite good, and the earbuds definitely tangle much less than traditional cables.  "
overall pleased with purchase.
really like these earbuds... long cord and stay in my ears.. usually have problem with fitting my ear..
but these stay in while running...
my son has been using these headphones for his school ipad
and he is loving them cause they don’t get tangled up in his backpack.
they also fit and stay in his ears really well.
i would say the only thing i didn’t like is that they kinda stick out a ways in my ears and my hair would get caught on them but that’s why he is using them.
but they work great!
i like the thick cords.
the sound quality is great.
i have small ears and normally earbuds do not fit.
but there do.
they are comfortable.
i liked the headphones a lot though you can't use them in newer iphones without an adapter which i didn't realize before ordering them.
the cord also seems a lot longer than other headphones i've had in the past.
other than that they really are great headphones.
"this is my first time using this headphone brand and might i say, i love the result."
the sound quality is excellent and it doesn't tangle easily.
"also, the velcro attached to the headphone in the packaging is so cute and different from what i have seen."
overall i do recommend these headphones; if you need a cheap good quality pair of headphones.
i am always looking for headphones for a cheap price with good sound quality and comfortability.
these checked all of my boxes!
very lightweight and easy to keep in my purse.
i love these!
"these fit so much better, and the sounds are great."
"i have had a lot of mp3, and a lot of headsets, this was the best pair i ever had."
these little earbuds have great sound and surprisingly deep bass  !!  
i am very happy with my purchase  !!
for the price you cant go wrong.
excellent for when big headphones get in the way.  
like chilling before bedtime.
these earphones are made to prevent itself from getting tangled.
the earpieces fit nicely in my ears.
there are 3 sets of ear bud tips to fit the different ear sizes.
"this is an overall robust earphone and when i put these on, i can't hear anything else besides the music, which being played at a very low volume."
"also, i forgot to mention that this pair of earphones looks very aesthetically pleasing and sleek."
strongly recommend.
the earbuds seem to be built well.  
the sound quality is good for the price.  
they just don't seem to have the best fit even after changing to the largest ear bud.
these headphone are surprisingly really comfortable!
they come with 3 different sizes of soft tips to fit your ear size.
most headphones i can tell that they are in
and they get uncomfortable after a while.
i use these for my work computer
and i forget i have them in until i try to get up.
they have great sound quality as well!
these are good for the money!
"i got them to use for my work computer and meetings, good quality for the price and ships fast ."
i wear headphones a lot and these fit so comfortably with the angled earpieces and dont fall out when walkin like other headphones do.
the sound could be a little bit louder but thats just my personal opinion.
the red part keeps popping out of the black piece of the earbud.
so far they still work so 2 stars instead of one.
"i was looking for something affordable to use at work, and these vogek earbuds are perfect.  "
the sound is really very good.  
i switched to the larger size bud to better fit my ears
and they fit great and cancel the outside noise (maybe a little too well for a work environment 😉).  
i will probably buy another pair (or two) to have at home and in my purse.  
definitely recommend giving them a try.
"earbuds have three sizes, - small, medium and large."
"finally,  i found one that matches my ears."
the sound is clear.
great price and good quality.
"earbuds have three sizes, - small, medium and large."
"finally,  i found one that matches my ears."
the sound is clear.
great price and good quality.
i liked the noise cancelling performance and the quality of the sound produced .
they were also comfortable to wear .
i have used these earbuds for a couple weeks now and am pleased so far.
they are comfortable and don't fall out of my ears as easily as other brands.
i also appreciate the cardboard box packaging - it protects them just fine without wasteful plastic.
i bought the flat cord in hopes that it will last longer (i commute to/from work with earbuds
so they take a beating).
i use them for podcasts and sound quality is fine for that.
i really like these headphones !
they have a variety of ear buds so that they can fit each ear perfectly.
i have smaller ears
do this really made my day to see i could adjust them.
the treble comes and nice and crisp and the bass is amazing?!
bought these on a whim....
and i definitely recommend these to anyone.
good for the money an absolute must buy for music lovers.
i bought these a few days ago and they work really well!
they're comfortable to wear and although it's only been a few days
i haven't gotten tired of wearing them yet.
"the sound is pretty good (i don't know much about headphones though, tbh)"
and i would definitely buy them again if i had too.
i like the color of them and how the cord doesn't tangle either.
easy to store as well.
"overall, pretty good!"
these earbuds are to die for!
it comes with two other rubber earbuds pieces to get that comforting feeling.
i use these on my ipad and the sound quality is wonderful.
i have had a pair before
but i lost them
and i been trying to find another pair.
"finally, i found out amazon has them"
and i was so happy.
i’m a lucky customer to them and always will be.

install flash player first thing i noticed was how clear the sound is.
i like that
you are provided several different sizes of ear pieces.
i was able to find a size that if very comfortably.
i also like that the cord is long enough to use easily with my cell phone.
the ear buds were packaged well.
great price!
ordered a second pair.
"comfortable ear pieces, including a size for smaller ear canals was a plus, but the clincher was the sound quality."
i've not had a clearer pair for under $15.  
"not impressed w noise cancelling, but comfort and sound quality were very good."
the sound quality is ok could be a little better but not bad at all for the price.
there very comfortable fit in the ear and don’t fall out
these headphones fit nicely in my ears but are a tight fit for my 10 year old son.  
we both agree they help cancel out ambient noise.
the sound quality is decent and for the price they were a great buy.
"i would recommend to an adult friend, although may not be appropriate for a smaller child's ear."
love the head phones.
they are amazing for the price.
several people in my office have the same ones.
its great
they come in different colors.
by no means the best earbud on the market.
"however, for their price, i believe these are the most affordable earbuds that will give you the most bang for your buck."
earbuds come packaged in a nice box.
earbuds are extremely minimalistic and clean.
my one complaint is that the head of the bud feels very skinny and narrow and can be hard to grip onto if you have big hands while taking in and out of ear.

"install flash player good bargain for this pair of earbuds, suitable for basic use like listening to music and videos online."
i recommend based on the price point.
"good sound quality, i specially like the flat cable design that avoids cable tangled in the pocket."
i thought these would be perfect  
"they work fine and they look fine, but they make my ears sore"
inexpensive earbuds but the build quality and the sound are above what i expected.
i really like these earbuds
", i hope they last."
the sound quality on these are as good as skull candy.
well worth the price!
will order more.
"i don't like wireless headphones, and these wired headphones work great for me."
"i stream a lot on my roku device, and i plug these into my remote, and the sound is great!"
"the cord is a great length, and they look outstanding."
i'd definitely recommend these to anyone who wants a pair of wired earbuds.  
"i can't see anyone wanting to get the white ones instead of the black ones, cuz"
the black ones just look that frickin good!
i had this for a month
and im still happy with it.
"its very light, easy to use and great for travel."
i never had issues of having left or right being deaf or not able to connect to my devices.
the microphone delivers clarity and the sound quality is superb.
its very comfortable to use and fits my ears.
so worth the purchase and taking time reading reviews and searching products.
i got these yesterday and ended up ripping the package open as i was late heading out and realized my bluetooth earbuds weren't charged!
i was surprised by the sound quality - it was less canned than my bluetooth earphones and the volume worked well
(didn't have to turn it up past the samsung recommended hearing volume on the crowded bus).  
i've definitely gotten used to wireless earphones
but i will keep these as a back up for when i need to make calls (got the earphones with the mic) or if i forgot to charge bluetooth earphones.
here are some of the positives i liked : 1) excellent clarity in audio quality both during calls and
movies 2) conversations through the mic can be clearly heard by the person on the other side 3)
lightweight and well designed earpieces.
disclaimer- comfort is a relative term and depends on individual choices.
i just recieved this in the mail and these earbuds are so easy to use.  
my first walk with them was comfortable and the sound was very clear...
the seller was very nice and easy to work with..
i would definitely buy again!!!
these are great headphones.
they are equipped with microphones
so i can participate in skype meetings and take calls from my laptop at work and home.
the sound is excellent and is not static at all.
highly recommend as a non-wireless option.
just got them in
and i am currently using them to listen to music while i type this review!
these earphones have a great fit.
i've used other earphones from amazon in the same piece range but bought these after i lost my previous pair.
"the mic quality on these are far superior, people on the other end of the phone usually report to being able to hear me much better."
they don't have the annoying tips that you have to deal with - fit is usually good for everyone
and i enjoy the fact that i don't have to worry about losing the tips
(they sometimes come off when kept in my pocket).the audio quality is surprisingly good for the price!
the bass is quite nice.
you won't regret this pair or earphones if you buy em.
this is good for people who lose their bluetooth earphones like my kids.
so i got them these
so they stay put onto their ipad rather than losing them.
the sound quality is great and it seems like they’re very comfortable using them as well.
sound has lots of bass and earpiece is very comfortable  the quality when you use the phone is really good  
my son said they were diffently better then the ones i got at the department store
my sister needed a headphone but she didn't want to spend much.
i bought this for her
and i'm impressed by the sound quality.
i will also give an update after a few weeks!
got these for my son.
"he loves them, said they work well and he likes the way they look."
awesome replacement for my wired ear buds.
has nice mic for making phone calls.
i like this !!!  
the sound is clear and it's very comfortable to put on.  
perfect to wear when i'm jogging or working out at the gym.
great headphones with amazing sound quality.
does the job as described.
needed an earphone with the usual aux jack for my macbook air after i upgraded my phone to the new iphone 11.
sits in the ears well.
would highly recommend.

sound quality is nice and cleam
"this earbuds are great on sound, very clear."
love them thank u so much
everything nice.
1.
noise cancellation at its best2.
pretty decent bass and treble for music lovers3.
i bought it exclusively for office use so that i can walk around while talking on long meetings
and it serves the purpose4.
you can carry it on your flight journey or any journey to get rid of the background noise and just for this single reason5.  
best ergonomic design and gives no trouble to ears even if worn for long time
these headphones are worth it!
my cat messed up my aunts previous wired ones.
i got her these since she can’t work some bluetooth earphones if her life depended on
if 😂
and guess what?
she loves them!
"the sound quality is so good, not static at all."
the bass is pretty banging too.
i got the ones with a mic since it comes in handy.
overall great buy.

i love it with build in mic.
"they are comfortable, great fit"
it came very handy.
seriously they’re like high end at a fraction of the cost.

"good choice for the price you get two of them, granted the sound are not on par with more expensive in ear  phone"
but this one does
the job alright.
"if you are looking for the greatest sound quality this are not it, but for basic headphone these are more then enough."
so far so good 
the earphones work perfectly fine in terms of 
"sound quality ,good replacement for original earphones."
"they work fine, and they are very comfortable. "
"i have worn these earbuds for more than 12 hours a day for a long traveling, and they felt just as good at the end of the day as they did at the beginning. "
"no soreness in my ears, which has been a problem with other earbuds."
"if the $30 earbuds you buy at apple are a 10, these are like an 8-9."
"i’ve bought a number of these replicas to hold me over until i could get to the apple store in town, and was always disappointed."
they look like the real thing but sound quality was always 5-6 in comparison.
the bass and volume were always horrible.
these are really close in sound quality to the apple oes and was really surprised at how well they sounded.
i actually had
the earbuds plugged in to my phone
while
"i was recording, forgive me"
if the sound was muffled in any way!
i absolutely
adore this particular earbuds
", they are basically"
the only ones
"i ever get, they are extremely loud when ur listening to something on ur phone which"
i adore!
"i can use my phone with them, control"
"the volume button, pause button etc."
"no static, absolutely incredible"
sound is great.
"a little concerned because the wiring does seem a little thin and most ear buds break off at the ""hinges"" that connect to the ear piece."
will just try to take care and store them carefully so they last as long as they can.
good value though.
i got these headphones exactly one week ago and already the right ear is no longer working for the pair i've been using.
i never anticipated i would have to use the second set for a while
but unfortunately that looks like the case.
hopefully that one was just a one off design flaw
but i'm not holding my breath.
"otherwise, though they actually look identical to the earphones you get with your iphone as opposed to looking like the ones advertised on the box, the sound quality has been very good for the time that they actually worked."
frankly i just wanted a pair that fit in my ears without that rubber
squishy bit most earbuds have these days as those don't fit my earholes.  
"these fit, they sound good, the mic quality is good, and the controls actually work whereas the apple buds (which fit my ears best) do not work on android.  "
"i find no evidence of noise cancellation, but fortunately i don't need that feature."
"we like apple's earpiece and do not like ""cordless"" ones because they are expensive and they'd probably get misplaced at some point."
so we get the $29 one at the apple store - which also get misplaced from time to time.
the other day i found these and when they arrived the first thing we noticed is that they have the same apple look and texture to the touch.
the sound also tested really well.
"this way, when they get lost, the actual loss will only be $4 instead of $29 - 'cause you get 2 in each box."
cool!i recommend them.
great value.
my iphone ear buds stopped working after 2 months.
if these do them at least they can be replaced cheaply !!!!
"i've purchased 3 packs of these - one per gym back, one for the car, one for work, one for my purse, and one for home."
"they are as close to my beloved iphone earbuds as you can get, and the price is amazing."
"i've not had any issues with them, and will continue to purchase these as needed."
the sound quality is good with sufficient bass to stand out but not so much to hurt my sensitive hearing.
"design of the actual ear buds isn't a favored shape of mine as it takes a few minutes to get them settled into my ears, and even then i wouldn't say they're comfortable."
"this is a question of my preference,  as i've had both high and low quality earbuds with this design and haven't been a fan of any of them."
"look at the product you'll be getting - if you can't figure how they'll go into your ears, consider that when deciding to purchase."
"having said that, these are in the mid range of ear buds"
"i've gotten, not terribly good, not terribly bad."
will do well as backups to keep in purse and desk in case they're needed.
very durable and great sounds  
i love these android headphones. 
"simply because they work under all conditions,   easier and safer using."
"it came really fast & is high quality,packed very carefully  and came in "
well before the expected delivery date.  
they fit comfortably in my  ear--not tight. 
"connect my computer, my phone and my projector and the audio "
is  real nice going to my speaker system with no issues.
"bought these by reading some good reviews and i agree these are surprisingly good earbuds, the sound quality may not be as good as apple one, but they are definitely much better than the ones you buy for $5 at 5 and under or tjmaxx, or even comparable to those t $10-$20 range ones."
and these are cheap.
bought some more as i know these won’t last too long
and i will probably lose it at some point.
recommend it.
i fckn love these headphones!!!!!!
definitely recommend!!
i can hear everything in my sex videos with these!
from his moans to my deep breaths... everything!!
i think i heard my neighbors fart in the next house!
when i say the sound quality is beyond amazing...
😩 everything is crystal clear!
talk about a bang for your buck!
thank you amazon !!!
definitely ordering again soon!!!
"terrific headphones, the sound quality is something like"
"apple itself would have, deep base"
it's almost surround sound.
plus it comes with all the great volume buttons attached to the right
ear
bud
so you can adjust the sound with a push of the button
and it has a mic
so you can talk hands free.
"i'm so glad i ordered these, i'll be buying more!"
these would be good even if more expensive.
to me they sound like the apple buds.
they don’t compete with higher end buds
"that have silicone nibs, but aren’t meant to.  "
these are comfortable for many more hours.
i’ve had these for over a week and really like them.  
i will by more
", my wife took one pair already."
i have bought so many of these.
these earbuds are great for school students that have chrome books.  
i use these for watching netflix and other things on my phone.  
if your wanting earbuds to ust to talk in these arent good for that!i use my more expensive ones for talking on the phone.
"looks like a duck, walks like a duck . . . ."
but it's no
duck!don't let the looks fool you
- it's not iphone quality!i gave one a as a gift and kept the other.
on both earbud sets the wires split in multiple places within a few weeks!very cheaply produced.
i bought these to use at work for two purposes.
"one to listen to podcasts and such without noise cancellation, so that i could hear my coworkers and still talk to people if i mute what i'm listening to."
"for that they work just fine, sound quality is adequate."
"the other purpose was to be able to talk hands free while working, for that they fail completely."
no one can hear me well.
every call i've made people complain that my voice is too quiet or scratchy.
i gave up trying to make it work.
this ear bud fits my ear perfectly and blocks most of the outside noises.
it is about the same length as andoird phone ear plugs.
good alternative.
use them at work.
they're great but after getting wet with sweet several times the mike and other buttons won't work.
good value though
way better than i thought it would be.
i bought when i original headphone stopped working.
it sounds the same.
it’s really worthy the money.
i will definitely recommend to my friends.
i bought several earbuds from other stores and none of them worked in my phone or were comfortable.
these are great!
they are comfortable and work perfect for my galaxy phone.
the price was excellent and i got two of them with the order.
i will buy again if i need to.
"it wasn't as advertised, not even on the package, didn't have the features that i was looking for!"
i'm sending it back regardless
(you need to examine it yourself)!!!
here's the tracking number for this item
(i'm returning only one of these as the other one was a gift and the other party didn't want to return theirs)!
it's in the package with the dog mat replacement return tracking # 1z8110y69028758447
2 for the money one for you and maybe to share
"great sound for the price,  even better than some expensive earphones,  "
"i'm used to the sound of brands like akg and bose and this is pretty good actually, perfect for any everyday use and the best part is they're 2 per box!i recommend them for personal normal use"
"this is the third time i have purchased these, a quality an very inexpensive earbud option.  "
"if you want want to pay a ton, but want something decent for headphones, get these."
the sound quality is excellent highly recommend
these are awesome.
"love the design, sound quality and price."
worth it.
i’ve used for a while and everything was good.
if you got a cat at home
"and it broke your earphone all the time, it is a really good substitution."
when i first put these on the audio was unbelievable.
i can now hear what i am trying to view
and i am not frustrated anymore.
thank you for such a good product
my daughter is harder on backpacks than any child i have ever seen or heard of.  
she packs so much stuff in the backpack that she has to sit on it like an over stuffed suitcase!  
until i bought her this one we tried all kinds.  
she is an avid horseback rider
so it was even more of a bonus when we found it with horses on it.
it is not too heavy like some.  
it has many pockets which is great.  
the color has stayed looking new.  
every rolling backpack(or not rolling)that
she has had has fallen apart at least half way through the year.  
she is in 6th grade and this backpack is still holding strong.  
"the zippers are still working, which is usually the first thing to break because she packs it so full.  "
the bottom has not ripped which the second thing so go since she usually drags it instead of rolling it.  
and it still looks great.  
it doesn't look worn which is amazing considering what it has been through.  
we would recommend this backpack to everyone!  
if i could have rated it higher i would have.
my old toshiba satellite laptop has always had issues with vibration and stopping the hard drive to protect it.
using it on my desk and having these issues has been driving me nuts.
"so i decided to try a  ssd to make my version of a chrome book for stability but keeping all my software, windows 7 and my data."
i used the crucial m500 480gb sata 2.5-inch 7mm (with 9.5mm adapter)
internal solid state drive
ct480m500ssd.this hard drive swap is almost foolproof but make sure you buy the crucial laptop install kit 2.5 for ssd at the same time.
the kit allows you to reboot your laptop and copy the old drive to the new ssd.
watch the demos on youtube by crucial and other techies with exact steps to lead you through this swapping process.
"it was so easy to do, even your mother could do it."
"(well, maybe not your mother, but"
you can certainly handle this job).  
my old toshiba is now “smoking fast” with this new ssd.
i like it so much
i just ordered another 480 gb ssd for my other laptop.
thank you crucial for making such a fine product!
you saved me from having to buy a new computer!
"i would rather grow and collect all these roots and herbs myself, but it proved to be way too daunting a project for me."
i am soooo glad someone else has done that part for me and all i have to do is pick
"which vodka i want to use to steep them in, hahaha!"
"i'm sorry they no longer package the ingredients individually but still, i'm very happy with this product!"
i've owned these panasonics for three weeks now.
"after owning two sets of etymotics, a set of shures, and countless iphone / off-brand cheapos, i can attest that the sound from these buds approach $80-$120 buds in all but noise isolation (i.e. you will still hear your lawn mower with these in, but not normal office noise), and blow away everything you will find under, say,"
"$40~$50.i bought a three-pack to have one at home, one at work, and one ""just in case.""  "
"the fit is super-comfy, the sound is full and rich, and as stated, does a more than respectable job of blocking outside noise (my etys were better, but i paid a whole lot more for them).  "
"was looking for a cheap ""hold-me-over"" replacement for a higher-end"
set my toddler set on fire
"(yeah...), and got a lot more than i ever expected from these unassuming little panasonics."
this is the most beautiful case i’ve ever had for a phone.
had a speck candy shell for my last one which i loved.
feel of this is similar.
the edges have a great grip and seem like they would hold up well in a fall.
has a small lip to protect the screen.
i combined it with tempered glass without issues.
overall the case is very sleek and non- bulky.
the wood with in lay is very nice.
this is american craftsmanship.
"worked very well for my situation--had a fairly good size parking lot to cover, using an mr62.mounted antenna 9 ft in air pointing downward slightly.  "
antenna partially obstructed by eave of awning but still worked great in my application.
"i had full wifi signal almost 100 yards away, straight from the antenna with a clear line of sight, and full signal perpendicular from the antenna about 30 yards away, clear line of sight.  "
"signal behind the antenna dropped of after about 25 yards, obstructed by the awning's wood-covered steel i-beam."
"i'm not sure about the signal drop off from in front or to the side of the antenna because it covered the parking lot with full signal to every corner, about 50 yards by 100 yards."
this antenna gave me great coverage and was easy to install.
"worth the money to us, will be using tablets in front lot to check-in cars and take pictures of collision damage."
exactly as pictured.
the pink might even be slightly lighter
but it's perfect.
i've had these headphones before so i enjoy the quality
and they're not noise cancellation
but they do block out most sounds unless you're somewhere really noisy.
for the price they're great.
this is an amazing little vaporizer.
"when i say little, i mean little."
"it is in fact, tiny."
yet it's built very well.
it's also very simple to use.
"load, pop in battery - wait literally 2 seconds, and start drawing."
beautiful vapor in an instant.
it's also completely silent.
i ordered from vapeworld and included in my package
"was the launch box, one medium and one small mouth piece, a brush for cleaning the screen, 2 nimh aa batteries, a sanyo nc-mdr02nu nimh charger, a clear herb holder, herb grinder, and a black bag to hold it all."
"shipped from florida monday, arrived in california by the same wednesday using standard shipping."
also included is a lifetime warranty by magic-flight.
"if there are any issues down the road, just send it to them and it'll be fixed or you're sent a new one."
"if you plan on using this a lot, i highly recommend picking up an extra charger/batteries."
check out some of the quick chargers here on amazon that have batteries included.
"also, keep in mind that the launch box only works properly with nimh batteries rated 2000mah and higher."
"ultimately - if you want an instant heating, low-profile, absolutely silent, efficient vaporizer with a lifetime warranty... this is exactly what you're looking for."
"give it a shot, i highly doubt you'll be disappointed."
your lungs will thank you too!
i havent actually used this one yet.
"the extra's were a cool deal, i have more of these units."
i use them to boost the mp3/ipod players output into my motorcycle helmets
so i can hear my music at freeway speeds.
they are great!
no controls at all.it is just a simple high quality amp.
it turns on an off automatically when you connect it's line in port to a source.
the only other thing you can do to it is put new batteries in it.
"great units,"
"very small, i actually tuck them inside the padding of my helmets."
i bought other small amps and was disappointed.
so i fell in love with my boostaroo
and then my kid starting riding with me
and she took it
so i had to
but this one for me....
they have newer models available but i stuck with what i knew
i have a 43 year old yeasu ft101 that i use daily.  
the only reason i would consider a new radio is associated with notch and filter considerations.  
now that i have completed and installed my vec-830k half of the battle has been won!  
hum and hiss have been brought under control...

i received this product about 3 years ago.
it has held its sound and quality since the first day i got it.
i am very impressed with this product for the price that it is listed at
", i think it is a great deal and well worth your money."
i am and overall happy and very content customer with their product.
i had not heard of this brand before buying it and didn't have too much money
but i am glad that i went with it.
looks great in the engine especially after painting everything else orange!
i bought this backpack since i coach 4th grade girls.
it is perfect to haul around everything.
it has plenty of hidden pockets to store important items.
the front portion detaches
so you can use it as a purse or fanny pack.
i also use this for traveling and going to the gym.
i am definitely getting my monies worth from this product!
i've ordered these in several colors...
"they are very pretty, soft and feminine...."
i'm very happy.

i'm very happy.
bought this to replace the thin cable that comes with the akg y50 headphones.
great and incredibly durable.
the cord is black with red undertones and made of a woven material.
i am now looking for the same in red for my wife's akg's.
if you have these headphones they are a perfect addition or replacement.
"well made, perfect fit, the only downside, will not fit spike's tactical launcher, its too long to fit in the breech.  "
you actually have to remove the tube to insert it
and then it is 26.5 mm only until you remove the tube again.  
kind of annoying.  
still 5 stars because it is beautifully built and high quality construction.  
highly recommend for non spike's launchers.
awesome headphones for the money.  
better than j-brah or the jl audio stuff that breaks just as fast.
can't go wrong with these.
it's huge.
i used it on july 4th and watched independence day with the fam.
the picture is great and it's definitely a good deal.
i just gotta build a frame for it instead of stapling it to the side of my house
(it was in the spur of the moment ok)
"another fabulous product with the greatest benefits, just love it."
very highly recommend this product.  
thank you also for fast delivery and great price.
daniela j.
i purchased these after reading the reviews.
i will say that they were just like the other users described.
looked nice and easy to exchange.
the only issue is that the buttons are a little stiff.
maybe they'll loser up over time
so i won't have to break my finger using remote start.
seller refunded my money since batteries did not fit my phones.
used on my boat batterie cover.
hope when it goes off it will scare the thief’s and make them fall into the water!
love this.
use everyday.
"awesome stickers , everyome was digging them at work lol."
not a lot to comment on.  
"the rules are made of steel that is, to me, ""just right"" in thickness.  "
nice and stiff without being too thick.  
"markings are silkscreen on, not engraved, so these are what they are, low cost disposable steel rules.  "
i have owned them long enough to know the markings will last just fine for my purposes.
omg these blow bose or other brands out of the water.  
i have them hooked up with a yamaha 473
and they sound absolutely great!  
you can hear every little detail and the bass is amazing.  
these speakers can shake the house if i crank them up all the way.  
i bought them on the recommendation of a friend who is an audiophile.  
i am glad i did.
awesome light....
if it is a fenix....
it is good...
i got this for my buddy who is an avid fisherman for his birthday.
he loved it!
he said they are well made and can't wait to go out fishing with them.
i can't wait to see what he catches with them.
great piece exactly what i wanted for a shell i found on vacation in fiji.
great piece exactly what i wanted for a shell i found on vacation in fiji.
lasting much longer than previous unknown battery.  
i now get over 1.5 hrs panasonic cordless phone operation with more to spare.  
old battery was only good for 50 minutes or so.  
"new one does have small larger capacity rating, about 20 %."
the real deal!
"found this for less than half the price, thank you really good stuff!"
shipping took a little longer but that was fine because i paid nearly nothing for the dispenser!
its amazing what these handles did for my bk 14 !!
literally turned it into a new knife.
the grip now is amazing and it looks cool
do ha.
they are extremely durable and feel like they could withstand serious abuse.
"i received a full kit with black and orange handles, two allen head screws a two nuts"
i purchased two of these switches.  
"although the units were refurbished (as stated), they were in perfect working order, clean and in good shape.  "
"all the hardware (cords, mounting brackets and screws) were included.  "
delivery was extremely fast - i received them the next day.
great high quality jig heads.  
nice assortment of colors and one is fluorescent.  
purchased 2 sizes because we primarily fish for bass and trout.  
can't wait to hit the river.
love this light up egg!
i bought 1 and loved it so much that i bought 3 more!it gives off a beautiful green glow for my dark room.
it requires 2 aa batteries and looks like a candle is on the inside.
highly recommend.
these turn out cute for the baby shower
display amber pieces.
great
love em
best fever blister over the counter medicine ever!!
this is a great case and you can't beat the free stylis.  
kindle fits great and the automatic awake or sleep mode when you open or close the case is so convenient.
it swivels very nicely and was the primary reason i chose this case.  
love it.
this tape dispenser is perfect.
"it's heavy enough to use one-handed, it has slip resistant rubber pads on the bottom so it doesn't slide all over my desk when i'm trying to use it, and it fits a standard size (1"") roll of tape.  "
"plus, the color is great!"
love it!
good price.
works great.
quite powerful.
"works great with my 2010 mercedes c300, w204 with nav and ipod interface.  "
turn on the option in the engineering menu including guide lines.
for less than $100 you get a backup camera that works with good resolution.  
"if you have a minimal skill set, you can install it."
okay this review is long over due.
i bought a decal (totoro) for my friends birthday (in march) and she loved
it!!the product came on time (even with a few extra goodies - that i used for my laptop).
it also had a smiley face on the order form.
"totally worth it!it's kind of an ""it"" thing in college to have a mac with a cool decal and case."
i have an hp
and it looks just as good! (:
this is a really pretty necklace.
i wish it came in silver too.
it is shiny and not cheap looking at all.
great with many styles and necklines.
definitely width the wait and super cheap.
just as described.
i don't think they sell this style of bottles at the stores any longer.
the new style is very hard for my mom to open or close due to arthritis.
since she watches my kids these bottles very well.
delivered on time and in well packaged to protect the wall art.
beautiful product appears just as advertised.
does the job very well.
seems to have no effect on screen sensitivity.
just what i needed so i can hook my phone up to my printer.
now i can print from my phone...
just what i needed so i can hook my phone up to my printer.
now i can print from my phone...
using it right now.
exactly what i was looking for.
it close without much effort.
"look great, easy assembly"
these are the best...way better than bags...
i would of liked to see better screen material...
but they are working fine..plus a 5 year warranty
i love my sticker.
it comes with two bonus stickers and came on time!
:)
no bubbles to worry about very easy to put on.
i thought it was really small when i got it
but that was just me.
everything is perfect.
make sure you read the description.
if you have a different size macbook contact them and get the right size.
"bottom line, its a great product, easy to apply and"
you get gifts.
i definitely recommend this.
"i used this to take an 18v output from a dc tool battery & make a usb charger, works perfectly."
exactly 5v dc output according to my multimeter.
my panansonic kx-tg2336 telephone handset was dropping calls and complaining that it could not connect to the base station.
even though the battery meter showed a full charge i suspected that it could be the battery.
this replacement fit perfectly and resolved the issue completely.
"the cable arrived sooner than expected, in about three weeks."
i checked it right away
"(i use it to connect my laptop to the stereo, which doesn't fit on my desk) and the sound quality is beautiful."
it's exactly what i wanted at a low price.
recorded video was really dark and the colours were all off.
"then i updated the firmware (go to the hauppauge dot com website, support, rocket firmware) and it's all crisp and clear now!"
"great little device, very easy to operate, would recommend to anybody that wants a high quality but easy to operate screen recorder."
"and of course the ability to add a voice-over while recording, this was by far the best solution for doing so."
i was so pleasantly surprised when i received my order very promptly.
"the swedish bitters mix was very reasonably priced, neatly packed and smelled fresh."
"it will take me fourteen days to prepare& taste the product, but i am quite confident that this is a very good product."
this case is sturdy and you'll have difficulty removing the inner plastic cover.
"there is a little opening on the lower right hand side of the inner case, you can place something in the opening to gain leverage and you can pry off the case."
i love this case more than any other i've had.
this thing will not pop off when you drop your phone
the stylus that comes with it is pretty cool too - especially if you like match-3 games like i do.
"this case also looks fabulous, the little gem stones have just the perfect sparkle."
my friend loved this!  
works as expected.
fit my car and matched factory color !
"these are slightly larger than the original paper sleeves for my 45s, so you can put both your records and inner sleeves into this."
works for me.
great product thanks!
love it!  
my husband has several repsol motorcycles and so this gift was the hit of his christmas!
this is a simple sweet casual necklace.  
"its a beautiful color gold, lightweight and will go with just about anything."
found this company by chance.
loved my carved iphone 6plus case.
"light, durable."
it fit the phone like a glove.
so naturally i ordered another carved case when i upgraded to the 8plus.
same fit.
same durability.
this company is consistant.
plus the product packaging is on point.
i’m a sucker for good packaging.

this cushion is so great.  
my laptop is so heavy and was cutting off the circulation in my legs.  
it was also so hot
and i was worried about it overheating if it was on a pillow.  
this cushion is light and stays cool.  
just like described.
they arrived earlier than expected.
great sound quality and very bright.
it also can be connected to a variety of devices
such as  
"a laptop, tablet, cell phone, mp3 player and a dsi xl."
very good  product :)
the case is super cute!  
"it holds the kindle voyage securely, has nice snapping closures and wakes/sleeps the kindle as advertised.  "
i love the elastic handle and the nice little stand that are built in as well.  
would but a second case to give myself color options.
came sooner than the delivery date.
love it!
fits good and goes on easily.
it came with two
and i put it on the first time.
absolutely in love with this!
great for a minnie mouse party!
the best
so cool
the 1st
ear buds i have used that have been comfortable.  
i use them 8-10 hrs a night at work and have had them for a while now without them shorting out.  
i would definitely buy these again
this is used for my model train layout to produce musical effects during a public display.
good
came in protective shipping which is always a plus for fragile computer parts.
installing the piece was a breeze because it fit just like the stock piece that came in the computer.
would definitely recommend people buy this for replacing the airport card in an older macbook pro
"as a home use and non constant work stress, this meter will do just great."
the display is easy to read and proper size.
lightweight and affordable.
great for diy projects around the house and small buildings.
must have this y splitter if you using multiple venture heat products.
"love it, i'm proud to show off that i'm a horse show mom."
"easy to apply, easy to see, and hasn't come off yet."
works well.
could be a little brighter.
perfect replacement for two power strips mounted on back of my entertainment system.
the others were destroyed when i had an issue with my power.
nicely spaced receptacles for large transformer plugs.
quality and price can't be beat.
blended perfect although if you look closely you can tell difference but most likely it’s
9.5/10 color difference
great product wifey loves it
very warm this is a cold weather comforter used in camper and kept plenty warm.
the labels fit and worked perfectly in my zebra thermal printer.
thanks for a good product!
"this vga cable (assuming you know that only transmit video signals, unlike hdmi which takes care of audio as well) works great for my laptop and hd monitor."
everything works fine under 1080p solution.
"exactly what descripted no problems ,came exactly on shipping date."
i bought this for my macbook pro because i was tired of looking at the fingerprints on it and wanted something besides a solid color.
i get a lot of compliments on this cover and it fits perfectly.
it was easy to put on and has never peeled or torn.
cant beat the price.
"small, compact and bright."
i attach it to the rear view mirror and it fits perfect!
beautiful!  
lots of compliments.  
"they are mutlfunctional and can be used as placemats or on end tables, cocktail tables etc."
i believe i will be able to use them more often then just for christmas!  
reasonably priced for the quality!
"i like that it is recessed, i had to put these in the floor with brushed stainless plate cover.  "
does the trick.  
looks nice.  
don't expect a tight connection like bnc.
"holds more of camera gear, could be 25% larger"
i got them for my bf they are his new favorite gauges
i bought this ring for my fiancé.
"it was too big, so"
"i asked if i could exchange, fully prepare to pay shipping"
both was.
i was told they would be happy to exchange it for me.
with free shipping on the exchange!
"great quality ring, my fiancé dropped it on the concrete."
"after a few bounces and skids, we picked it up expecting it to be scratched."
not a single dimple!!
the seller is lightening fast with communication and shipping!
"great product, great service :)"
"i love these speakers, and despite the white color of the satellite speakers, you won't notice them after just a few days."
very nice sound for the price!  
no complaints!
i love this orgone generator.  
"purple people call theirs ""haromonzers"", but by any name it is beautiful."
it's great!
"hard to get in stores near me now, so being able to order it is terrific."
and the product is the best (i think) of the meat substitutes.
"thanks, amazon."
"great water-resistant case that is slim, but provides just enough storage to hold a charging cable and couple spare sd cards or a flash drive for added storage."
zippers and strong and sewing is quality to make for a sturdy product.
"good price, the jigs look well made."
this was purchased as a bedroom tv.
i read that some people thought it wasn't loud enough.
i haven't noticed that.
the cd doesn't go in the way you think it should.
i had to get used to that.
the remote that came with it wasn't the one made for the tv.
"i found a dealer online and ordered the correct one, no problem."
"i recently got hd cable, and the picture is excellent."
the quality of the recorded items is crystal clear and the device's memory is outstanding.  
i've recommended the device to my friends and at least one has already ordered one.  
thank you.
good psu.
very nice and different fashionable style.
works great.
i checked it with my voltmeter before using and everything checked out good.
works great for my scx 10 to extend my run time.
i have used optixcam products in the past and they are great.
i decided to upgrade to the 5mp camera.
it comes packaged with a small protective plastic film over the sensor.
when i removed the film i damaged the sensor cover.
i emailed the seller and with hours they sent me an rma number to return the camera for repair
at
no cost!
i told them that i damaged the unit and they still fixed it and shipped it back to me for free!
i have never seen customer service like that.
i would highly recommend them to anyone.
a very well made  computer backed by industry leading support!  
has everything that i need and more.  
it has exceeded my expectations thus far...
carries my asus vivobook x202e and all cables/accessories with ease.
decent sleeve if you want to carry it around in a backpack and have a little extra protection.
it has a great picture and also good sound too.
love to use it on the airplane on long flights.
works best with noise cancelling earphones.
you can get them on amazon for about 100 dollars.

"hello kitty, i introduced this case cover to everyone, thanks, and wish someday they will have more selection."
as advertised works with all the features being accurate
good string quality .

"i can use my car as a mobile speaker at a parking lot dance, or convert my living room into a full surround sound party anytime without wires.  "
this is a great device.
great case!

makes such great product
this is truly the best olive oil you can get for a decent price in the us.
it costs almost half the price (per oz)
when compared to grocery stores.
i highly recommend this product.
great bag - love the fabric -
only issue is it does not stand up straight and will fall over occasionally
but this is not too much of a problem
product just as described and worked beautifully!
first time i had tried black diamond but won't be the last.
price was 30% cheaper than anyone else.
i am well pleased!
thanks!
it is perfect for my home in florida!
they work as  expected to
big and feels nice as expected
the adapter cord is more heavy duty than my original cord that came with my computer.  
"the connection fits nice and snug, unlike my last one which constantly fell out."
i am very pleased with it.
easy to use and convenient especially for travel.  
toss when you're done.  
great for on the go families.
great i could get these delivered to my house.  
"a little spendy,"
but it beats driving 250 miles to the nearest store that i know
sells them.
writes & wipes up very easily.
i bought these for my american girl doll collection and they are the perfect size!!
i tied a cute ribbon bow through the bottom loop.
the best!  
now i have more than enough poulets.
and i* can span 4 feet of my desk....
unreal!
worked perfect in my toshiba satellite c55-a5220!!!  
good speed & great fit with the cd drive bezel..
product is exactly what i need to repair our phone line after water was poured on the old one.
the fit was just right and works well.  
would buy again.
very well made and comfortable
affordable and it had the two screws for attaching the power cord i already had from the previous power supply.
my son loves it.  
works as advertised and is very good quality.  
we have bought several differnt ones and he loves changing them out as the mood strikes him.  
great deal
nice value on clearance.
a-1
i'm not gonna go on and on.
"just want to say this is the fifth portable vape i've tried,and is absolutely the best."
i would actually say it's better than the other four combined.
great quality and unique design.

"bother with the lighter ones, just get a launch box."
you'll save yourself frustration and burnt fingers.
did not realize that i could add more rame to this machine until i stumbled upon this...
now it runs a lot faster.
double the ram is a big deal.
great product.
super slow shipping..not to happy with that....
excellent lightweight and durable stock.  
highly recommended!
great!!!!
love it!
lays flat and great color.
"the ring is very attractive, has a quality finish"
and i have no complaints.  
i will share that it is a thick and heavy ring that you will definitely feel on your finger.  
very satisfied with the product and the seller (titanium kay).
i use thes cables for many audio and video connections.  
i think they are fairly priced and would recommend both the product and the seller.
great discs for the price i got them at which was $8.48 but other than that i would not buy them.
i burnt them at top speed (4x) on my asus bw-16d1ht blu-ray burner with no coasters.
solid.
worked great.
i ordered the wrong size (too big)
but i ended up keeping it and made it work.
seller was very helpful and quick to respond.
i tried to repair the old one with no luck.  
this was a good value compared to a new tv.  
it is still working with no problems.
looks great
good for price.
fitment was perfect.
there was no re-programming of any kind necessary.
"this kit only re-uses your little circuit board, and your actual key, making your key fob essentially look and feel brand new."
you get exactly what the pictures show.

does what i needed.  
"works great for all the routers, switches, usb drives, etc."

love everything about this.

this ring fit the bill = received it quickly and the price was right=not a bad looking ring either.  
not sure how durable it will be but for the price you can always get a back up if you like ;)
great
awesome tool ..
best leatherman ever..!!
"good device, mets all of our needs!"
so far great
wow!  
this is one of the best sounding portable cd players i've ever owned!  
"pretty big and bulky-looking unit, but it really sounds great.  "
it's definitely not for carrying around with you and there's no belt clip
", so don't plan on using it for that.  "
haha.  
"who would carry a cd player around with them, anymore, these days?  "
"i'm old-school, so i still like to listen to certain cd's with headphones,  while i'm falling asleep in my bed at night.  "
"also, it helps me drown out my loud and disturbing upstairs neighbour!!  "
: )  
this is very conveniently designed with easy to use buttons.  
you can even see the disc spinning inside the unit - if that sort of thing makes you happy!  
the battery compartment is on the bottom and easy to access to change the batteries.  
a 6v jack to plug it in to the wall if you don't want to waste batteries.  
"nice easy-to-view display with track #'s and track times, also the battery use is displayed"
so you know when it's running low.  
only bummer is that it's not lit up in the dark.
"oh, well.  "
can't have it all
", i guess.  "
i just use my little flashlight if i really need to.  
this is a seriously sturdy and well-made machine.  
don't let the bulkiness steer you away.  
i'm listening to some classical spanish guitar music on it right now and it sounds just beautiful!  
i love it!  
i always loved my aiwa shelf system from way back and thought it had awesome sound for that sort of thing.  
"usually shelf systems are very cheap and tinny,  but"
aiwa always seemed to me to have a great sounding well-made product.  
same goes with this unit!  
whatever happened to aiwa?
satellite speakers:
"the satellite speakers are solid aluminum, are painted with high quality high gloss white paint."
"a well-kept secret is that if you gently remove the bottom plastic piece with a putty knife, a 4mm screw hole for mounting is revealed!  "
"i have mine mounted, which makes them look and sound even better.  "
"being an audio nut, i have experimented with a few different speakers including a harman kardon ht set (the nice kind with the 3 drivers each), and 4 polk monitor series bookshelf speakers, paired with the cs2 plok center channel.  "
the kefs are smaller than both of those sets
"(way smaller than the polks), but they sound much better.  "
"the kefs sound clearer at (especially at low volumes), and blend better with a sub than the others."
not sure why some people dislike the egg designs.  
"they remind me of something that jim rockford might find in the condo of a millionaire 70's hottie in distress, whom he ultimately helps-out later in the episode."
the kef c4 sub:
"first off, can anyone think of a better name for a sub-woofer than c4?"
"anyway this is a small 8"" sub that is boasts an external volume control, along with an external crossover.  "
it also has a removable power cord (standard pc power cord i believe) and a power switch.  
the sub itself sounds just awesome;
"very punchy, and not boomy.  "
"i compared it first hand against a 10"" polk, and a 12"" harman kardon, and the c4 defecates on both."
the sub is built solidly and tough.  
my brindle boxer regularly puts his front paws on the sub and stomps hard.  
"all while looks out the window and barks menacingly at whatever kindly old man, or"
christian stroller-pushing-soccer-mom happens to be passing by.  
"after a couple years of that, it still cleans up nice in a few seconds with a tiny bit of mild cleaner.  "
i use a highly diluted mixture of sal suds in a squirt bottle myself.
summary:i actually prefer this model over the subsequent models from kef that succeeded the kht1005.2se.  
"the newer ones still sound great, but i don't care for the goofy new designs of the kef subs, or the rubbery outer texture that some of the newer kef satellites have."
"while the kht1005.2se does not sound as good as the british made kef 103.2 speakers that i use in my garage, they sound pretty darn nice for a home theater set."
"if you can get a hold of some of these eggs for yourself, i would highly recommend doing so."
protects hands from callouses and tearing without changing the grip or making your hands sweaty!
these are great!
i was worried that they would rub or bother the space between the fingers when they were being broken in but the material was soft and sturdy at the same time.
they hold up well and enable you to still lift the same way as if you were not wearing anything.
because they are not gloves they do not encase the backs of your hands and don't get stinky or alter your grip at all.
very happy to have tried this style item and not gloves.
measure your hands and use the chart to make sure you select your proper size.
both hand wraps looked the same and were comfortable.
i bought this received very cheap
but i was surprised of all the features and performance it was offering.  
first of all this received doesnt have any optical and digital inputs but only analog which can be little annoying in today's world.  
i had a onkyo receiver from 2007 that broke down and for a while i replaced it with this one
and i thought that i wont have any surround due to lack of all digital inputs
so i connected everything through analog inputs.  
"when playing hd-dvd, dvd laserdiscs and blu-ray movies"
i was surprised that it detected a dolby surround and all 5 channels came to live.  
it is actually able to decode dolby surround through white left audio channel and split it into 5 channels not quite 5.1 but sounds pretty good.  
it has tons of inputs and if somebody is still using composite for video
it has video enhancer that makes a big difference by making picture sharper and cleaning some noise
but i only use for laserdisc and everything else has hdmi.  
sound wise it is one of the best sounding receivers i have ever heard.  
"i have it connected to definitive technology monitor 350 speakers, definitife technology mythos 7, kef sub and paradigm bp speakers and it really rocks the house.  "
"i have also tested it with kef tower speakers, paradigm towers, mythos 3, and set of jamo"
speakers all speakers rated above 120w minimum and this received
"handled it like a pro with clear bass, beautiful and clear treble and at not even half of what it can do.  "
"i have owned different kenwood, onkyo and some newer pioneer receivers but this one sound wise is the best.  "
i demonstrated it even to some people that work in audio business and told me that this is one of the legendary pioneer receivers with some top of the line japanese parts that why it sounds so good.  
"highly recomment it especially for stereo or even for dolby surround with 2 fronts, 2 back, and center speakers but not realy 5.1sound.  "
beside that little shortcoming on new 5.1 or dts codecs its still a very capable receiver with powerful and beautiful sound.
perfect!!!
this works perfectly.  
"i use this at my desk permanently on the end of the lightning cable with a headphone jack, that way i plug my phone in and have the ability to plug headphones in as well.  "
i also got another one to keep with my battery pack to charge my phone on the go.
i love cats but sometimes you will have a neighbour's cat who will choose your garden to leave small
"""presents""this device will make no harm to them but what will happen is their sensitive hearing will perceive the ultrasonic waves as a warning."
"basically the human version of reading a ""do not enter"" sign."
"combined with a powerful light, triggered by movement, any unwanted visitor will stay away from the site."
"amazing repeller, i rented a vegetable plot, planted seedlings and melon seedlings, and i was always ruined by mice."
i quickly put it on for a few days and found that the vegetable plot was quiet and i had to admire the repeller.
"strength, good item, worth buying"
this is a wonderful combination of desktop and tablet.
"i'm still trying to get used to windows 8, but the setup steps are built right in"
and you just breeze through the steps
and you're done!it
was easy to assemble and you can get a link to an online manual which you can save to your computer for future reference or print out as needed.
i followed the directions to add an additional monitor without any issues and i'm really enjoying exploring all the applications that come with the system.
received my bracelet about three weeks ago packaging was okay
it could have been a little more jewelry like
but the jewelry is fantastic i love the silver
it's nice and bright dainty and very nice can wear it dressy or just hanging around the house
scam product with nothing but copy and paste reviews
", many of them aren't even for earphones."
avoid purchasing!
i was impressed by the sturdy build of this tv mount and how it folds almost flush against the wall - especially considering it offers a full range of motion.
"installation took a while, but that's because i had a hard time finding the proper studs through my plaster walls."
"once the studs were located, getting this tv mount put together and mounted was easy."
"fit my 42"" samsung led tv nicely"
and i'd recommend this to anyone looking for a less expensive full-motion tv mount.

i keep having to repurchase this bracelet.
my friends keep begging for mine.
i think this is bracelet number 6.
i just love this bracelet.
it is so dainty and feminine.
i get complements wherever i go.
works
"really well, i was dubious at first, but when i put it in place i’ve had no cats near my house."
very good product
i simply love the look of this bracelet.
the multi strand leather and beads add a wonderful layering look to enhance any outfit.
it is well made and i appreciate the fair trade value for the artisan who created this quality made product.
"and, i just bought a second one for my partner."
she loves it too!
my 10-year-old daughter and i love this lip balm!  
she loves the flavor
and i really like the fact that it's made with all natural ingredients.  
the texture is perfect -- not too thick or gooey like some other balms.
"i haven't take it on a flight yet, but the capacity is awesome, the wheels are the smoothest i have ever experienced, and it is so lightweight"
i can't believe it.  
this is exactly what i was looking for.  
hope it holds up in the air as well!
"fantastic sound, cool design, everything a fan wants including wild tiger's awesome emblem on the earphones!"
sturdy and well put together.
i stuff these headphones in my pocket on regular occasion
and they still work great.
thank you!
my husband absolutely loves this ring.
he has a horrible track record with rings.
they have all been lost because he has to take them off for some reason.
not this ring!
he said it's so comfortable he forgets
it is on most of the time.
"the loves that he can work out, work outside, basically get dirty and then take a shower without ever having to take it off."
he really likes the way it looks too... much more manly than most rings.
very satisfied customer and
i highly recommend to others!
i want to brag about this product.
wish it had been available years ago.
very quick and easy to make - the kids favorite snack to grab when they are hungry.
"whether served at breakfast, a dinner side (they offer more flavors), entertaining or a late night snack"
"- seriously this is my ""go-to"" when i am searching the pantry for something delicious that everyone enjoys."
this adapter is just what my husband needed in order to charge his iphone 7 and use his headphones and or other accessories at the same time.
"performs well, and small and easy to stash in the car or anywhere you may need to use one."
i use my earbuds for singing and immediately noticed a change in the mic quality.
even the texture is different.
"but i thought hey, still a good deal!"
fast forward two months.
these things just crackled and sent little mini shock of electric into my ears while listening to a voicenotes in imessage!
like the kind of quick spark you get when you rub your feet on a carpet and touch someone.
but continuous.
i yanked them out and threw them in the trash.
i’ll go buy from apple website now.
you get what you pay for.
i just got the headphones like this !
open and empty box 😡
"after losing my iphone7 earpods, i bought these replacements---crossing my fingers that these would be legit apple products (my order was ""sold by amazon"" new as a prime exclusive)."
i miraculously found my original earpods
so when these arrived i compared them directly to see whether they matched up.
"the ones amazon sent me are just like the ones i got with my phone, and the packaging is just like all my other classic apple stuff: everything sealed, meticulously held in place, documentation, etc."
photos below show all the box details and the packaged earpods.
the only thing that seemed slightly different was the thickness of the main cord---these are a tiny bit thinner
it feels like
"(but i got my iphone7 some time ago so these might be the ""current"" version)."
"as for sound, i can't tell any difference between my original earpods and these replacements.  "
my one star off is because the shape of the actual earpiece is not my favorite.
"that's just preference---or ear size, maybe?update:"
"looks like amazon isn't always offering these as prime-exclusive, or at all."
"i would never go for these if listed by others, new or used."
head to the apple store otherwise!
i bought 3 pairs of these headphones for christmas gifts for my daughters and they have all quit working.
i bought them one month early before christmas
but they have only been able to use them since 12/25 and already broken.
"i want to start off by saying i hardly ever write reviews, unless i think the product is simply so amazing i have to let others know or"
it was so god awful
i hope to steer others away from it.
this is a case of the latter.
"after receiving them, they worked fine for one day and then stopped working."
"a little background: i only use these headphones at work at my desk, so there's no chance they fell in water or were stepped on or anything."
"here are all the issues i encountered:could only plug the lightning cord in one way, if you flipped it and inserted it wouldn't recognize the headphones and would play through my iphone's speakersone earbud stopped working"
completelythe microphone stopped working completelythe volume would increase and decrease on it's own
bought less than a month ago
and they are already on the fritz.
"they keep activating voice control, cutting off whatever i'm currently using them for (listening to audio, talking hands-free)."
it's driving me crazy and is a major disappointment.
(please read entire review before basing opinion)when
i recieved this product i immediately started using it since after my last pair broke
i had no replacement
so i had to use my iphone without earphones for 2 weeks.
at first it seemed like my product was working perfectly fine
so i started binge watching youtube videos to catch-up on most of the videos i missed (mainly asmr videos)
however after a few hours i had to unplug my earphones to plug in my charging cable and charge my phone.
"the next day, i woke up unplugged my iphone from the charger plugged in my earphones and on my way to school"
i noticed that the right earphone wasn’t working anymore..
i’ve tried to make myself remember if by mistake i may have pulled the lighting jack a little to hard and ruined the product
but i’m usually very gentle about this
"so i don’t think it was my fault however, not being 100% sure"
", i can’t accuse this product of being faulty."
so to be clear this product worked fine like it was supposed to at first
but then didn’t.
i accidentally left my iphone 7 headphones on a plane when traveling with family.
these work as well as the original ones.
would buy them again.
these are most definitely counterfeit.
i bought these to have a back up to the ones that came with my iphone
and they are not the same in comparison as far as sound or build quality.
"i’ve only ever used apple ear buds since the first ipod i had because they stay in my ears, and because the sound quality is decent."
i know apple earbuds.
as soon as i plugged these in and fired up spotify i could tell they were not the same.
"tinny, echoey, no base resonance, and they scratch when you touch the controls."
spend the extra few bucks and buy directly from apple.
looking through more of the reviews it is now apparent most are fake.
"well, i would give these earphones a 5 star rating."
but the only problem or the issue i see was the packaging they arrive in.
the earphones work perfectly fine in terms of sound quality and seems to me very authentic apple earphones.
"having discussed the issue about packaging to the seller, they informed me that the earphones come in this e-commerce packaging and apparently claiming it to be bona fide apple product."
"as long as the product is working fine, i am good.4 stars only because of the packaging"
but i believe thats the reason for the product being low cost.

these are honestly the best headphones with a mic that i have ever owned.
i have had them since may
and they are going strong.
quality sound for music and for phone calls.
the mic is awesome as well.
i can be rough with my things and these headphones still work despite this.
i have always had issues with in-ear headphones fitting comfortably.
but these headphones came with enough bud sizes that i was able to find a size that fit my ears perfectly.
i intend to by more for myself and as gifts for my family.
"ok so, these are much better quality than you'd expect for the price.  "
"they don't feel super high quality in hand,  however, they work surprisingly well."
they are louder and more clear than other headphones i have that were just a tad pricier.
"these aren't beats quality of course or even closer to it,  but 4 for $10?!?!"
these are great!!
i got these simply because i can't afford to go buy expensive earbuds one at a time anymore.  
"on average, i destroy at least one pair a month because i sleep in them, every night, and listen to audiobooks as i drift off.  "
"unusually for me, i am still using the first set out of the box"
and this is weeks in.  
"they're exceptionally sturdy, and although they're not the woven type that i've bought before, they seem to hold up a lot better than many other more expensive brands."
i love that all four sets came in a single box--and the box itself would be just adorable as a gift for a teen.  
"well, i'm not a teen, but when i manage to destroy all but the last pair of these, i am going to order them again.  "
"i have not used the mic feature in them, and i don't think i will, so if that's a big concern of yours, look at other reviews.  "
i do wish they came with extra spare in-the-ear rubber caps like others i've bought.
i had no problem with them and thought it was a great product until 2 people i was talking with said there was a horrible buzzing sound
and they could barely hear me.
i disconnected the earbuds
and they could hear me fine.
i'll have to keep searching for a pair that actually work.
"love them,  great amazing headphones for the price,  and"
"yes they actually have bass which shocked me,  "
these looked like dollar store earbuds
"so i was expecting the worse,  and man was i wrong,  they did a great job on the sound and"
the quality of the headphones are amazing!  
you get 4 of these just for 10 dollars???!!
what a steal!  
great seller and overall very pleased so far!
surprisingly decent sound quality and comfortable.
ear buds usually fall out of my ears but these stay in and usually they hurt my wife's ears because they are small but she also finds these comfortable too.
arrives in a cool box and each wrapped in a plastic baggy.
"we go through headphones like sunglasses, will probably be buying more soon."
"i thought these were great for the price, and other reviews seemed decent, but these are highly disappointing...."
"there’s only a play/pause button that allows activates voice command on your cellphone, but nothing to control volume."
"that has to be done manually, which is a pain if you’re listening to anything with random thrown in adds that are never the volume you’re expecting"
"and you either have to endure a painful noise assault while you have to stop what you’re doing and manually adjust the volume, or rip your earbuds out....."
"also, all sound is just off sounding."
literally nothing sounds right.
it’s to the point
where
it’s driving me nuts
and i literally can’t enjoy listening to anything.complete waist of money.
don’t bother with these.
i highly regret this buy....
"and lastly, as long as you have these earbuds in, somehow, loud outside noises seem to be amplified and filter deep inside your ear to the point of being painful."
my kid’s arguing is annoying normally (
toddlers that can’t share) but
it’s never made me wince in pain before until i bought and started using these.
it’s horrible...
well the first pair didn’t work
so i tried to take it out of the player in my car and the cord just came right off.  
so these are no good.
"i think it's important to note for these earbuds, while they *are*"
low-cost and
*
"do* come in four different colors, their quality is lower than even the low-cost would let you assume."
"i wasn't expecting fantastically-sounding earbuds, but at least serviceable audio quality."
these earbuds do that.
"they're certainly not the best earbuds i've ever used, but that's not why i bought them."
"i wasn't expecting a perfect ear-fit for these earbuds, but at least something that would stay in my ear most of the time."
"these earbuds do that, too."
"they aren't a sealed fit and they don't come with four sizes for your ear canal, but given the price that all was expected."
"mostly though, i wasn't expecting earbuds that arbitrarily lowered the volume of the audio coming from my device."
"these earbuds do that, and it's the reason for my low rating."
"a little research into trrs and some googling seems to indicate these buds are picking up ambient outside noise with its microphone and converting it to a signal that my device interprets as ""lower the volume""."
"maybe it's a design oversight, maybe it's just laziness on the manufacturer; whatever the reason, i cannot recommend these earbuds for normal everyday use, because they don't do the one thing i need them to do"
(allow me to listen to audio).
this was a surprise.
cheap great for the money.  
if you are always looking for it loosing your ear buds this will be your dream.
these will not fit your cell but tablet or mp3 there are just great.
update  these will fit cellphones

they literally started falling apart not even a week after using them.
"i'm not rough on my ear buds either, since i keep them in a case and only take them out to use during my long commute."
"the sound quality wasn't bad, but considering they are built as sturdy as tissue paper"
i can't recommend these.
there are similarly priced ear buds on amazon.
save your money and go with a different brand.
lesson learned on my part.
i should have listened to the other reviews.
these are pretty nice and definitely worth the money.
"they are comfortable in my ears, the cord isn't super flimsy, and i have no issues with the sound quality."
"considering the price, these are great for people who burn through ear buds but don't want to burn through their wallet."
"i only use these to listen to audiobooks, but these are awesome for that."
they're very comfortable in my ears and the braided cords are coated with plastic (or perhaps silicon) and don't get all tangled up like ones i have had in the past.
really good deal as well.
a total waste of money!
"3 of the 4 headphones did not work and the one that i did hear something, the sound was horrid and one ear would go in and out with sound."
whomever reviewed these and said they were great lied.
i brought these based on the reviews and feel totally scammed.
i purchased these headphones because i wanted a pair to use at work and also at the gym while i work out.
"i must say that i have been so disappointed with previous headphones that i have purchased because usually the volume isn't as advertised, and /or the quality of the product is poor."
but these headphones are the total opposite.
the sound is amazing!
i even have to turn the volume down sometimes because the sound is so clear and precise.
"the value is very good, especially because you get 4 pairs in really cool colors which is an added bonus!"
i would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a good pair of high-quality headphones at an economical price!
my son has sent too many nice headphones through the wash.
two of three of these lasted reasonably long and my son was happy with the quality (and
the one that died may be his fault).
"for something priced as a disposable product, i am pretty happy."
overall good earbuds for the money.
two things about sound quality.
they constant staticy/fuzzy sound when you turn up the volume.
"not unbearable, but a little annoying if you notice it."
"also, whenever you bump the cord you can hear it though the earbuds, so i would not recommend them for running or other athletics."
"basicly, in sound quality, you get what you pay for."
comfort was acceptable.
they fit firmly in my ear and stayed in place.
value for money is pretty good because the cost divides out over the amount of pairs you buy.
they will last you a while.
"if you are picky about sound quality, you don't want to buy a bulk pack anyway, so look elsewhere."
"if your not picky, i would recommend these if you need a few pairs."
great price and value!
we kill earbuds frequently in our house..
great backups!
"when they do work, they are amazing."
but these are definitely not a long term earbud replacement.
each pair only lasts maybe 2 weeks before it stops working properly and keeps turning off your music.
you have to then bend the wire to properly hear again.
price wise they are cheaper
so i guess it’s worth it
if you need some spare/temporary cheap headphones that get the job done
but i would not recommend these if you want them to last more than a month.
all 4 pairs combined might last you 6 months with very gentle use perhaps?
definitely not for people who are rough with their headphones or throw them in their purse
(like i sometimes do)

this headphones is the perfect one for this price.
it fits my ears nicely and the ear pads insert easily into place for a gentle cushioned feel.
the sound quality is good and it does block out some noise.
"i have also used it while walking, running, cleaning and other exercising."
i am very satisfied with this purchase.
i really like these bluetooth headphones
don’t i have to charge it everyday like my other ones battery lasts
"the design of the headphone is pretty cool, easy to use, and comfortable to wear."
it is worth the price.
very reliable wireless headphones.  
been using them for about 3 months without an issue.
cute and functional.
awesome for price!
works
good quality and great value
super cute!!!
great quality.
great
very plush
as expected!

reasonable
wow
love it
exactly what i was looking for.
good quality.
works great very pretty
works great
great gloves.
nice and thick but not too thick that you can’t bend your hand to grip the oven tray.
they are coated with silicone so you can grip the tray without it slipping.
they can be worn any way around on any hand.
great product
perfect
works well good price
speedy delivery and a good product.
everything as promised.  
great shipping time.
bought these as a cheap set of headphones to bring with me on trips.
the audio quality totally took me by suprise!
these are really nice sounding.
"bass is strong, deep and tight, mids are clear and accurate, highs are well defined but not overly done."
these are also comfortable since they don't clamp down on your head.
the top pad is also nice to since it helps in overall comfort.
"the earpads are good enough for the price, they block out noise"
well
but i can see them wearing out in a few years with heavy use.
"the microphone is really clear and good for calls, i dont think it's noise cancelling"
but it works well as people on the other end dont have an issue hearing my voice.
overall these are awesome!
"sure they aren't made out of metal, but they're good enough for the price."
i tried all sorts of cherry mx boards and switches.
i finally thought i'll give the topre switches a try and went ahead with the hhk.
i loved the hhk and it was excellent to type on but
"few flaws/features like the control key mapped to capslock is ok for typing but terrible for gaming, especially mobas."
also the lack of arrow keys on it was just something i could not adjust to.
"i'm pretty comfortable using h,j,k,l"
"as i'm a vim user, but using fn with the oddly placed arrow keys was a deal breaker in the rare occasion i have to."
that brought me to the leopold
and i must say it's just been a day of typing on this
and i already love it.
the fact that the control key is where it should be and can be switched by flipping the dip switches makes it so much more customizable when gaming or not.
also the arrow keys are present on this board which is a huge plus point.
the keys feel great to type on and it does feel a little more than 45g.
"i would say this is about 50-55g which is a good thing because cherry mx browns can be a little too light for most people to type on and you will bottom out the keys more often on it,"
cherry mx blues are about 50g
but if you don't want the loud clicky-ness and prefer the firmness/pop of the keys then this keyboard will make you really happy.
the sound too on this keyboard is a nice rumble and not too loud for an open space office environment.
i get that some people don't think high-quality/price usb cables are worth the money.
"i get that most - if not all - of those same people would tell you that usb cable construction doesn't matter as the signal is ""all 1s and 0s, dude!"""
"(wrong, by the way... it carries 0s and 1s, yes, but not as an optical/light signal).i also get (and agree) that you shouldn't invest in a cable like this unless cable quality, signal interference, or some other cable related issue has become a/the limiting factor in higher quality recordings."
"but with all that said, should you decide it's time to upgrade to a better usb cable"
"(in other words, don't buy this if you are just starting out), i think this is the best valued product on the market."
beyond this in the cableworld lineup
and you get into diminishing returns.
you'll have to plow lots (ie hundreds) more dollars into them for an equal step in quality.
outside cableworld the quality to price ratio is totally messed up
(we're looking at you
audioquest).in
other words
", if it's time for a better usb cable, this is your first and only choice."
why didn't i say that straight away?~jericho kenobi
this unit is fabulous in many ways.  
"i did not want to spent nearly $1000 for a shower sytem, but nothing for under $500 fit my needs until i found this.  "
"it was exactly what i was looking for: an overhead “rain” type head and a separately controlled hand held, which can be operated together or separately.  "
i researched the manufacturer and found it is a team out of eastern europe.  
the product however is made in china.  
yet it is super high quality...
"all brass fittings, no plastic anywhere.  "
extremely well crafted.  
the final test was how it worked.  
the rain shower head is on a ball and socket connector and can be adjusted.  
the force of the stream is strong and delicious to experience.  
"both my husband and i have remarked that is it so pleasant, we just want to keep showering."
"this product greatly exceeded my expectations, and at $179 was very affordable.  "
this is great value.  
i wish i could give it more than 5 stars.
"i bought these stickers so that i could remove the middle ""d"" from the dodge sticker on the tailgate of my dakota, and put one of these in its place."
"they fit perfectly, and after a couple of months the sticker i used is holding up great."
"my only complaint is that i haven't found a good enough place to stick the other 3, but i'm glad i have them if the need arises."
my german shepherd is extremely intelligent indoors.
"she obeys verbal and hand commands but open the door and let her outside, she became an instant idiot."
i almost gave her away until i decided to give this item a go.
i'm glad i did!!
it only took about 3 zaps from this collar and she doesn't dare leave my side!
i'd only caution that this should be used on a dog that understands some commands.
"if the dog doesn't know you and/or commands, this item is not for you because if you zap the dog, you'll only teach it to run away."
"this was everything i needed and the shipping was great, packaging, etc etc."
i love this product.
"it's hard to find stretchy nylon pettipants that don't cling;  they are better than regular slips, because you can wear them under pants (i.e., scratchy wool or clingy pants) or under skirts/dresses (ditto).  "
"so the thing to do, is to order them too large, then tack them at the waist.  "
"i'm not a fan of lace at the bottom, but with the right material you can just cut it off and don't need to re-hem."
these are such pettipants.  
"you want them too large, so they won't cling to you.  "
"they keep the dress/skirt/pants from clinging, as well.  "
"you also want them too large, because once the elastic wears out (and it will, in several years or after much wear) -- you can easily make them into something else, or fix them.  "
use fabric softener to reduce static.  
"the more often you wash with softener, the more you reduce future static."
"i learned all this the hard way, having bought the proper size years ago, which now i can't wear because i gained weight and now the garments cling.  "
so had to rebuy.
"very good price, too.  "
"quality is not top notch, but at this price who cares.  "
"i went the quality route the first time, to no avail.  "
these are plenty nice enough.
"the black is true satiny black, and the cream is true satiny yellowish cream.  "
they are not strong enough to hold up panty hose.  
"if you have purchased lingerie in the store and have those old store lingerie hangers, these work very well with those hangers.  "
"they travel well, and make great separators between your clothes in a packed closet.  "
"enfin, even after their useful life ends, they still perform useful functions!"

"i learned all this the hard way, having bought the proper size years ago, which now i can't wear because i gained weight and now the garments cling.  "
so had to rebuy.
"very good price, too.  "
"quality is not top notch, but at this price who cares.  "
"i went the quality route the first time, to no avail.  "
these are plenty nice enough.
"the black is true satiny black, and the cream is true satiny yellowish cream.  "
they are not strong enough to hold up panty hose.  
"if you have purchased lingerie in the store and have those old store lingerie hangers, these work very well with those hangers.  "
"they travel well, and make great separators between your clothes in a packed closet.  "
"enfin, even after their useful life ends, they still perform useful functions!"
"being a retired architect, i have always been in love with the chrysler building in manhattan."
"i have been there many times, and i feel that it is the most beautiful of all of the skyscrapers."
i have been looking for a building like this which has at least some reference to the eagle gargoyles and the hub-cap torchieres.
"i am happy to see that there is one, so thank you."
it arrived in 2 days and well packaged.
you have my recommendation to anyone who collects these statues.
"these pillowcases are amazing, i love the fact they are hypo-allergenic because i have tons of allergies and this was the perfect fit for my bed clothes."
they are so comfortable and soft
you just want to climb inside of them and snuggle.
they color is even brighter then the picture.
"love this set, now we just need the sheets and we would be all set."
great price and
you can not beat the thread count on these.
need to order more of them!!!
"edit, the wash report:  "
"i washed the jacket in hot water, and dried on high cotton heat.  "
"it did not shrink, but of course has to be ironed.  "
think of classic duck twill for clothing worn on boats.  
"that's the material, here.  "
"i wish it had shrunk, but it didn't.  "
"even so, it deserves 5 stars, now."
"closest thing to something negative i can say, is that you should stitch the inner bottom hem, completely.  "
"they merely tacked it, so the fabric curls on the inside, after washing.  "
"just run it through the sewing machine using a loose stitch, and that curling will be obviated.===========i waited too long to get this (snow or milk) white one, so had to settle for a size much too big.  "
"this article runs true to size, yet given the cut, maybe order a size down from what you normally wear, if you want a fitted look like the picture.  "
"if instead you want a stiff 'tent' look, buy it many sizes too large, based only on your shoulders.  "
"for this white twill, is very stiff.  "
just what i wanted.
"hope they have it next season, exactly as made now."
"100% cotton, made in the india area (pakistan, bangladesh, india proper).  "
"so yes, it is boxy.  "
but the scallops are a nice touch.
"jacket is as shown, but in white it's a nice, heavy twill;  you will have trouble pushing back the material on your arms as its heaviness, will make them fall again;  but you can cuff the arms.  "
feels great.
"am washing it right now in hot water and super (length) load, in hopes of shrinking it.  "
"well-made, as i'd hoped, even gives you an extra nice button.  "
"(with these companies, certain things are reliable, like the jeans (not ribbed, not corduroy), the knits (if 7-day or 'soft' in description), and the twill.  "
pass up any suits
: they are made from labcoat polyester and will make you gag.)when
it's too large
", it passes for a chef's coat, except it's heavy twill.  "
brand is roaman's.  
"if you are petite, it will come to mid-thigh, which is what i wanted.  "
i love loose clothing.
"rated 4 stars, pending shrinkage report."
"bco sold and shipped this short carcoat, but the maker is woman within.  "
i got it on closeout for only $10.  
fits exactly as the picture shows.  
"to me, it would have been worth $50-$80.  "
"maybe more, for it is extremely well made.  "
"very impressive, especially considering it's made in china."
"coat has no smell, is very nice to the touch, has a diamond-quilted lining to match (like the kind found in those mandarin-collar chinese jackets, but not stuffed with foam).  "
"standard hip-length, nice light khaki color (unlike the gray one pictured,"
but yes like the description and the light khaki in other woman within colors of that designation).  
"best of all, it's washable (cold, tumble dry low, standard instructions).  "
"they even include one extra, of each button type!else, it's just like the picture:  boxy (which is nice in a coat like this), huge acrylic lapels stretching all the way to shoulder, huge patch pockets, nice cuffs.  "
"you can unbutton the cuffs to cover your hands;  you can turn up the sweater collar, to protect your neck;  collar stands up nicely.  "
very thoughtful design.
jacket drapes
"well, mid-way between stiff and soft.  "
yet i imagine one could wear it through briars.
"coat washed well on delicate cycle, cool water (rather than cold); but i would advise to tumble dry on air only, no heat at all.  "
"or, just hang after you wash it, letting the coat air-dry.  "
"for i did the tumble-dry-low per the instructions, using moisture sensor:  the lining puckered.  "
"so now the coat is a bit tight in the shoulders, and shrank maybe 1/2"" in coat and sleeve length.  "
"on the other hand, if you want that shrinkage, now you know how to get it."
"this fact means you should buy the coat based on the bigger of your shoulders and arms, or your bust.  "
"buy a size larger, if you plan to wear a thick sweater underneath."
"even so, i'm a very surprised, happy camper.  "
will look for another of these car coats.
"my only concern is whether the collar will pill, but even so:  a velcro hair roller removes pills quickly (never travel without one of those rollers).hope"
"they make this jacket next season, it's a keeper."
"edit, 9/18/13:  "
"i went through withdrawal after returning the jacket, so bought it again.  "
"sorry to confess this, but it's true.  "
"despite the 'cotton sheeting' comment in the original review below, i actually missed this thing.  "
ahhh.  
now happy to own it.  
"if you can find another one (this is the last one on amazon), know that it feels great, on.  "
has that decorative-stitch look in more classy fashion than usual.  
"original review follows below.==============i'm returning this only because the picture seems to depict a twill jacket, but in fact the material is cotton sheeting, soft and even sueded like quality, old-fashioned handkerchief cotton, or fine percale.  "
"but i needed twill, for crispness.  "
this jacket will need to be ironed.
"the jacket is well tailored, and if you are big in the shoulders, you'll love this jacket.  "
"its shoulders still look padded, but are not:  some magic in the way they had sewn it, preserves the football-player look, but without the pads.  "
for it's tailored in a long-coat menswear style:
goes to mid-thigh if you are of average female height.  
"i really wish i didn't have to return this jacket, due to its wonderful length."
"inside, there is no lining on the back, but the sides are nicely lined in milky polyester acetate, with the regular man's style of inner pockets.  "
"split back, real flap pockets and breast pocket."
"again, it is with great regret i must return this jacket"
(amazon offers free returns on it).  
wish it were cotton duck or twill.  
hence four stars.
replacement for old ipad.  
pleased with purchase.
"i have bought many, many glass containers for lotions, soaps, etc"
i am very impressed not with just the quality of this glass...
but the color is just beautiful!
really a piece of art.
the design is unique.  
i am getting two more and one green one.
i bought the oramge and it is an awesome light amber.
"again, very imprressed."
"had my eye on these loose-fitting capris for a long time;  they are sold and shipped by bco, but made by"
"woman within, so you can search on either brand.  "
"got the pumpkin, hoping to match a polo i bought from roaman's 20 years ago.  "
"yep, it matches!  "
think of a pumpkin pie:  
"that's the color, exactly."
"nice linen feel, just like the picture.  "
"standard machine-wash cold, tumble dry low instructions;  here, it's important to take those instructions seriously, as the material will likely shrink if you don't dry it on low.  "
"i did wash and dry the capris on low, and they did not shrink."
"the 'almost' in the description, is due to the linen.  "
linen is famous for wrinkles.  
"even if you remove the capris from the dryer immediately while still damp, they will still have that rumpled-linen look.  "
you can spray them with water to remove some of it.  
"you can iron them with starch or sizing, to make them crisp.  "
"yet the moment you wear them, they will wrinkle.  "
"so if that bothers you, don't buy linen fabric at all, because linen always wrinkles."
"as for me, i like the rumpled linen look if it's not white, as i love how linen feels.  "
these pumpkin capris are thus ideal.
"both of my cats, but one in particular, really like this led motion-activated hard plastic ball."
"the concept is similar to that of string-play, when one dangles or wiggles a string for a cat, and then stops the movement."
this abrupt stop in motion stimulates kitty and she pounces!
"when this ball starts flashing with alternating colored lights, it holds kitty's attention, and in a fairly short time the lights stop."
"that's when my cats get interested the most, and go up to it and bat at it."
mine is not so much motion-activated as it is touch sensitive.
my cat boo-boo likes to lie on the floor next to it and make it flash.
"when it stops, she nudges it a bit with her paw, and it starts up again."
"she'll lie there for quite awhile, repeating this play."
i think she likes the cause and effect power it gives her!
"it doesn't roll around easily, like most balls for kitty, since it's not smoothly rounded, but that's a good thing, because it would end up under the couch or some other piece of furniture too often."
"i highly recommend this toy for stimulating cats and acting as an ""interacting"" playmate."
love my hihopo laptop bag!
"i’m using it for a briefcase, so it hasn’t seen a laptop yet."
"the stitching is perfect in and out with no extra threads hanging off here or there, a sign of quality.  "
the bag is light so even with all my stuff in it
it’s convenient to carry.
"the look of the bag, especially the gray exterior gets compliments continually."
"my last bag had floppy handles that i was always looking for, but my hihopo handles stand straight up stiffly  "
-  makes it easy and convenient.
just a couple of suggestions; the bottom of the bag should have some kind of feet to protect from those dirty or wet places where we might set it down.
the zipper pulls tend to twist around and jamb.
perhaps there is something that can be done to keep them straight
so the otherwise nicely operating zips can work smoothly.
great product.
this is my 2nd fc660c keyboard.
cannot love it more.
"now among all keyboards i have, the ibm model m is the king and this fc660c is the queen."
love these towels.
"i purchased bath sheets, hand towels, and washcloths in this color."
i'd never used better homes and gardens towel but
will in the future.
very fluffy
and they absorb the water well.
especially love the oversized bath sheets.
"i bought a bath sheet to use at the beach or after coming out of pool but loved it so much, i bought several sets to use in my bathrooms."
easy to install and program.
great instructions.
works perfectly.
i really like how the touch pad can be illuminated.
will add more to my house soon.
"we've used this ice cream maker a couple of times now, and it is really fun!  "
"it makes great ice cream, and it's a slow process, but that's what is fun about it, too!  "
you have to wait for the reward.  
:)  
"i made a mistake by putting warm ice cream batter (pudding-based) into the maker and it didn't work that time, so i have learned to only use chilled ingredients!  "
"overall, a very fun experience for adults and children alike!"
very bright and high-quality outdoor floodlight.
i tested these side-by-side  with a 150 w incandescent flood light bulb in a two-story floodlight  fixture.
i could tell no difference between the two bulbs.
it also dims very well (down to 5%) with the plum lightpad smart wi-fi dimmer with alexa integration.
it was very nice to stay at the top of the ladder and push the microphone icon in my amazon app and talk to alexa.
"i would say ""set the back yard floods to 10%"" or ""set the back yard floods to 100%""."
that was awesome  
and i did not have to bother my wife!
i wrote a negative review in july when i had delays in receiving this product.  
"i have been trying to remove it, but can't seem to find how to do it.  "
"so, i thought i would at least send another review stating how much i love this essential oil.  "
"the delivery was an issue, because it is shipped from out of the country, which i did not know.  "
"the quality of the oil, however, far exceeds the oils i have purchased elsewhere.  "
it is an excellent essential oil
and i highly reccommend it.  
i am a certified massage therapist
and i use it in my practice with great results.  
please disregard my previous review.  
thank you.
"after i bought my laptop, i hunted several stores in the area, and also online, for several days, hunting for a carrying case for the computer.  "
i didn't like any of the styles that i saw.  
"they were either too plain, or did not suit my taste in patterns and color.  "
i wanted something unusual.  
"when i saw this one on amazon, i loved it!  "
"i ordered it, and was a little concerned that it was taking so long to arrive.  "
"i had ordered several things that week, and things i ordered after this had already arrived.  "
"when it did arrive, i noticed on the postmark that it was sent from england.  "
that explained why it took a couple of days longer for it to arrive.
"the product is great, and i am very satisfied.  "
"it has a zipper pocket on each side to store discs or flash drives, etc.  "
the colors in the artwork are just as brilliant as the photo.  
it is stretchy and durable.  
i would recommend this product to other customers.  
i love it!
very nice 10.5 inch case.
i bought it for my friend.
"he's just bought a new ipad pro, looking for a nice, sturdy case."
"the color of this case is very good, just like the picture."
"it's similar to apple's retail store, but it's a lot cheaper!"
"cost-effective, quality is very good"
", i recommend"
"according to _chinese porcelain glosssary_  ""...osmanthus is one of the 10 famous flowers in china and taiwan and the flower of the month of august...""  which would be appropriate for our niece's august birthday; although  ""..."
"osmanthus fragrans is associated with a number of lunar legends in china, which makes it symbolic at the time of the chinese moon festival which is held in september under the symbol of osmanthus flower and is also called osmanthus festival..."""
so perhaps we'll send this in september!the card
"is gorgeous - the company had taped sturdy cardboard around it inside the shipping envelope, so it was delivered in excellent condition."
"top quality, professional grade hardware.  "
arrived on schedule.  
properly wrapped and secured.  
just what i was looking for.  
it's plugged into my fender amp and feeding from a microphone cord.  
thanks.  
mm
this external cd drive operates just like expected.
plays cd's and dvd's like a charm.
"one thing i noticed, which i don't know if it was just the laptop i was using, but i have to use both cords that came with it."
the usb 3.0
"i thought would be enough to power the drive, but i also need the power cord as well."
i'm still very happy with it though and haven't had any issues at all.
"'calcutta' cloth, this is not;  rather, it is stiff ribbed poly/cotton (65/35);  but it is not uncomfortable.  "
"feel against the skin, is somewhere between seersucker and denim.  "
very durable.  
wish they made a jacket in this same material
"; it would be a nice complement, because the stiff fabric would make for a nice jacket drape."
"comfortable, relaxed fit.  "
"if you order sizes larger than you normally wear, put a drawstring in the waist.  "
'lemon ice' name is accurate (like real lemon ice); color is not shiny.
after two washings i see no pilling whatsoever.  
the pants do not shrink when washed in hot water and tumble dried on high cotton heat.  
"i've tried doing that twice to the pants, first on a normal length cycle and then on prolonged, hoping the hot water would shrink the oversized pants i bought.  "
"there is no fabric damage, either.  "
"so if you want the pants to fit as shown in the picture, order your true size."
"i only paid $7.50 for these, and that's a bargain."
i was only able to achieve a 30x30 link.
i won't blame the radios because it is likely an alignment issue or i need more height.
over all i am very happy with the performance.
i have been using the ptp link for a couple of weeks now with no issues.
excellent product with one exception.  
the battery life is too short.  
i find myself re-charging quite often each day.
i have been looking for a mongolian lamb throw in green for some time.  
i was delighted to find this.  
the color is beautiful.  
"while this is rather small, it was priced very well.  "
"i have other mongolian lamb throws that are bigger, but also priced 3 times more than this one was.  "
i'm very pleased with this purchase.
"this is a substantial-cotton mock turtleneck, not flimsy, great layer for cold weather.  "
"the mock neck is very thin, rising half-up your neck.  "
"i happen to like that fact; but if you don't, pick a full turtleneck, instead."
"the so-called 'royal' blue is slightly off-shade, more like columbian blue."
"it's light, not dark.  "
matte.
"it's generously cut, so order your true size or a size down, if you'll wear under blazers that fit you.  "
"order a size or two larger, if you'll wear with leggings, as these tops are long enough to go just past one's rear-end.  "
they drape well.
assume they will shrink if you wash them in hot water and dry on high cotton setting.  
"best to wash delicate warm, tumble dry low or even medium.  "
"that way, they shouldn't pill: but time will tell."
"i've been using this keyboard for a few hours, now, so this isn't a review that has long-term context.  "
"nevertheless, i'm enjoying the typing experience on this keyboard, far and above any other keyboard i've ever used.  "
it's hard to describe the action.  
"having never used a topre switch before i got this keyboard, i didn't really know what too expect.  "
but it's a bit like you would expect when pushing down on a rubber dome
", only it's smooth and the slight resistance when it's pressed makes for a really nice tactile action.  "
i am really enjoying it and couldn't recommend it more.
"i own a lot of crystal from waterford, nachtmann, hutte to baccarat and this stemware, with every appearance of being cut in the old style, holds its own hanging among them!  "
i couldn't be happier and will purchase more when i get another rack hung!
i've used this product for decades for the evil poison ivy
rashes
"i get, as well as some unidentified periodic weird rashes.  "
"i used to run to the doctor and get prescriptions for steroids which are horrid on my system, but eventually did the job.  "
so does this stuff without any of the side effects from steroids.  
"much much cheaper, too.  "
"my house does not go without it, i always have it on hand, so when somebody here breaks out from yardwork, out comes the xiao feng san (also known as dong quai with arctium).  "
it's safe
", it's highly effective and saves me from having to take icky drugs.  "
"i've recommended to friends and family, they all swear by it now, especially if they have kids and don't want to give them cortisone.  "
great great stuff.
i bought this for a senior 23 yr cat who was being terrified from a new kitten.
i loved the cover so kitten could not hurt my old blind
baby.this makes it easy for me to take care of him and all his needs.
yet my hurricane kitten can not hurt him.
"looking at the picture posted, i expected this blanket to be small ( almost too small)"
boy was i wrong.
this blanket is perfect size for a 7 years old on up to adult.
i liked all the extras that came with it
and it was a plus that it was machine washable.
i bought this for a present for an 8 year old girl and after receiving it i may end up buying another for my own daughter who is 9 and tall for her age.
fits but not as snug as original.  
this is a bit small.  
the paint will spray out while capping this nozzle
so be careful where you point.  
all 5 accept straws.  
"for extra straws, search hurricaineanesth straws.  "
best value i found here and fits.  
"these caps or other straws may feel they don't fit at first try, but little forcing makes them fit.  "
i got these straw nozzles for
more controlled and maybe longer reach for the rust converter.
"the six narrow drawers, about 2 and a half inches deep,  are perfect for the smaller items cluttering my desktop as well as for printer ink packages, scissors, small electronic devices (gps, camera) and similar items.  "
"the bottom drawer is about 8 and a half inches deep, good for printer paper and other larger, heavier items.  "
"the storage cart comes fully assembled, except for the wheels.  "
"there are indentations to indicate where to place and screw in the wheels, but not enough of an indentation to use a hand-held screwdriver.  "
i had to use an electric to penetrate the wood.  
"on the positive side, the wood was solid enough to warrant the electric screwdriver."
so far i've installed 10 of these in our barn so it will be super bright when working on our cars and various projects long after the sun has gone down.  
they are replacing some compact fluorescents that took forever (minutes) to get bright in our sub-freezing winter nights
(the main reason why i didn't opt for high efficient fluorescents - even at 1/10th the cost).  
what a pleasure to flip a switch and have almost instantaneous brightness!  
"there is a one second delay that seems common with all led bulbs i have tried, but they come on full and bright."
only one side is live so you will most likely have to rewire the fixture so the positive and negative terminate at one end.  
of course the ballast must be removed as well.  
it isn't difficult for most fixtures
but i encountered one ($14 fixture from lowes)
that made it very difficult to isolate the left pin from the right (it instantly tripped a circuit breaker and i eventually figured out
there was a piece of metal that i had to cut
"so it wouldn't permanently short; once i figured out how to get at it, no big deal but"
not something i'd want to do on every fixture).that's another thing: no light was damaged by any of my wiring mistakes.  
they just didn't light up when i got it wrong.  
nice.
"anyway, i've now got over 17,000 lumens for just 170 watts, and i'll be ordering another 10 bulbs as soon as they're in stock.  "
"two of the lights sent were cool instead of daylight, and the difference was obvious immediately - and i really hated the cool bulbs.  "
amazon made the exchange process pretty painless and cost-free.  
"it was a case of the wrong bulbs in the right packaging, so who knows how far up the distribution chain"
"the mistake was made?however, every single light has worked perfectly.  "
i like that they are ul listed and have a 3 year warranty.  
i just wish they didn't go out of stock so frequently
so i could buy more.  
"very, very happy with them."
my doggo loves these.
he gets 1 at bedtime and hasn’t had any poop issues.
takes him maybe 15 min to eat.
he’s an aussie.
i wouldn’t recommend for small smushy face pets or any with compromised trachea but larger dogs.
yes i work at a vet.
made in usa i trust this quality
the bulb works good...
still early but 5 stars for now.  
it had that new smell for a couple of days
but it went away.
color is good.
i like the picture on the dlp tvs.  
"they're less harsh on the eyes, in my opinion, than a lot of newer leds."
hopefully it lasts .edit:
iroronic...
a couple days after this review the bulb went out.
im getting a refund
"wanted to show support for my three kiddos, who are all lgbtq."
"and well, i love christmas ornaments, so any excuse to buy a new one..."
"this is nicely made, enamel over metal so it will last forever."
just what i wanted.
"it does what it was designed to do, i use this adapter for a usb mouse on a kvm switch."
"however, i was hoping it would also work with a usb keyboard which i found does not."
"a lot of sellers claim or input ""keyboard"" into this product's description leading many people into believing it would work with keyboards and then leave negative reviews/feedback when it fails."
"but its not designed for keyboards, even has a picture of a mouse engraved on the product."
5 stars because it does what it was designed to do though
i love this better homes and gardens bath sheet!
"i initially bought one for the beach and pool but loved it so much, that i have been buying for use in my bathrooms."
it absorbs so well.
soft and fluffy.
i bought this for a gift to someone that has many watches and they liked it very much.
there are many opinions about dog food.
i find this to be about the best.
my little dachshund only ate pinnacle her entire life.
she lived to 17 yo
"i have a small home bakery and usually wear plain white chef's beanies or bandanas, but this hat makes my baker-head happy.  "
i feel like i need to round up a bunch of kids and cook some green eggs and ham or something.
the fit is  adjustable and seems to have a good range.  
"i wear adult small hats and this hat can adjust a bit smaller, or a lot bigger.  "
"i have washed it in cold water, regular cycle and dried it in the dryer with no shrinking or fading."
"all together, a reasonable bit of frivolity to brighten up the work day."
"i was skeptical to order lamps, afraid they might not look like advertising, size, finish, etc."
"i was even teased a bit by friends, they had shopped for lamps with me before."
well......you showed us!!  
"in forty years, i have never had lamps i liked so well."
"they are exactly as advertised, actually, even nicer."
the finish and quality are impeccable.
"two of my friends have ordered from you since, one bought my lamps!!"
"the price was so reasonable, but it would be a value if doubled, and they were delivered ahead of time."
thank you so much.
these pants are great for hot yoga.
"now, before you buy, they are not high rise, super stretchy pants."
"they're more slick than soft, and fit snug - kind of ""compression"" like."
"you can pull them up to cover your lower belly, but they are cut to be low rise, so they'll slide down once you start moving."
"as long as you're okay with a lower rise, these pants are wonderful."
"they dry a lot faster than other yoga pants i have, which is really nice."
"can be slippery for stuff like vinyasa tree, but i'd rather be dry and slippery than super wet and slippery."
wanted to make homemade treats for our pugs.
"they sit and watch me make their ""cookies"" from start to finish."
please note:
i add an additional three tablespoons of water to the mixture and have found that i can work with the dough much easier.
i (we) love these pet treats so much that we now send them to frinds and family.
oh wow this case is beautiful ..very well made and feels very expensive  .and
a darn good price for the quality of the case..will buy more in different colors that's
gor surefit my ipad mini perfectly.
the boxes were beautiful!  
they were easy to put together.  
the tag for the boxes was different than the description of the item which worked out fine for me.  
"i purchased them for a baby shower and was planning to remove the tags but didn't have to since they said ""thank you"".  "
everyone loved them!
this pot is magic and although the rim arrived broken
it does not affect the functionality it works perfect
i have all kinds of kitchen gadgets
but this tops them all and wins hands down
i am buying another as soon as it becomes available againo
the ox tail we cooked was 10 stars
beautiful sheer curtains for our spare bedroom.
wonderful colors which will match multiple room decors.
we have blue/gray walls and nice green/off white bedding.
"love this pillow cover, for the price especially!"
decent quality and seems to be holding up.
i used a 20 inch stuffer pillow with this and really had to cram it in
"but it went and looks full and good, all corners filled."
"nice neutral off white color, borders beige."
nice quality， keep warm and sound is clear， easy connect with phone
this blanket was super soft and is now the favorite blanket in the house to use in the couch.
we may order another one!
a little wine was spilled on it and it came out easily too.
the sure guard works great
it's a little larger than i expected and
lot more install than anticipated once i have installed thing
works fantastic.
it's a great piece of mind
"know that i have all the electronics in my motorhome protected against electrical surges i now live in california, i used to live in alaska were electrical surges were quite prevalent"
i don't know about the rest the country
but since i travel from coast-to-coast i feel this is a great investment in both money and time.
the first couple times i turn power on after a hit and install the surge guard
i was a little dismayed that it takes three minutes or before the power comes on
that after i got used to it it seems to me to be very worthwhile
the three minute wait is so sure guard can evaluate the power coming into the motorhome and won't turn on the power to my appliances until it safe.

this has got to be one of the most awesome forms of cable management that i have ever used.  
i think i will be using these cable sleeves for all of my cable management needs from now on!  
beautiful and compact!
such high quality for such a reasonable price.
great weight and shine in a 7mm curb chain.
nice packaging with cleaning cloth included.
why go anywhere else.
these are beautiful.
"the description says velvet, but they are more a silk damask feel.  "
i find that i like that even better.
great price as well.
"i used to cook in the usaf, always wore a hat, so now that i am retired and older my hair occasionally has the desire to fall out."
"this hat not only fit my head, but also had the same velcro touch closure that was very familiar to me."
now that i am retired the whimsical
dr seuss was a nice addition to my kitchen.
"this was a gift, sort of a gag gift.  "
i loved it when it arrived and wanted to keep it.  
the gift received laughed about it but actually liked it and will be putting it in their garden area.  
well made and really cute kangaroo!
it's a little hard to build for one person but very doable.
with two people it would have been a cinch.
"looks damn nice, feels sturdy and is plenty big."
they are shorter than regular chop sticks and obviously intended for smaller hands.
they have nub or ridges on the ends to grab things easier.
"great towel, the picture doesn’t do it justice as the colors are very vibrant and bright."
i love most though the big size of it
these are gorgeous!
they are very thick paper & so durable that they have been used over and over again.
i love love love this!  
i bought it for our garden.
but my husband really liked it and decided that it was too nice to stay outside
my dog love this stuff!
wish it came in larger bags and that it wasn't so expensive.
beautiful blinds that fit our windows exactly.  
wonderful company to work with.  
we have purchased blinds from this company several times and all blinds have been perfect!!!
these flowers are for making a bridal bouquet.
the bride loves the colors and the real look and touch of the flowers.
they are also the perfect color
the clock looks exactly as pictured and seems to be very well made.  
keeps time accurately.  
(i've had it about 6 weeks.)  
very happy with it!
adorable!  
"no, it doesn't come with the plant"
but i didn't expect it to.  
"a couple of the kitties are clearly male, which is very cute!  "
"i got them for my mom, her 74th birthday, she loves them!"
the pillow cover is exactly what i wanted.
"it's made very well, sturdy."
the color on this cover are just what it shows.
a very pretty cover and is well priced.
i didn't catch that this crystal does not have a bail or chain with it.  
i wanted a full necklace
(they were ment to be gifts) and i thought that was what i was getting.  
my mistake
i did not catch the text that it did not have a bail or chain.
"(the picture is deciving, and makes it apear as"
if ther is a bail and chain with the crystal.)
i returned the shippment because it wasn't what i expected or wanted.  
"if you do not mind that this crystal doesn't have a chain and bail with it, than the crystal itself is nice."

gorgeous and well made.
looks wonderful in my kitchen with stainless steel accents.
"never saw any like this in our local stores, so glad i could order it here."
these earrings are a nice addition to my jewelry box!
"they are well made, and though they may appear to be black stones, when the light shines through you can see they are cut purple stones."
"and, even though they are just gold plated, not gold, they are not allergenic.  "
i especially like them because the gold and purple work with my school's color scheme.
dark purple cz 18k
yellow gold plated sterling silver teardrop dangle leverback earrings medium 10x14 mm
another quality product !
i am never disappointed with jbl .
ever been a jbl loyalist for over 2 decades .
product came sooner than expected and i hung them right away.
lovely lacy design and very elegant.
the soft scallop bottom adds a nice touch of class.
description of these curtains was right on.
would definitely order them again.
just as described.
would buy from this seller again.
really great quality.  
we use them often in our house.  
recommend them  to others.  
you will love the quality and the looks.
"edit, 8/6/13:  "
"this shirt became available in 'classic red', so i just got it, too.  "
"however, the brand is different, all american comfort.  "
that brand shrinks when dried on high heat.  
"everything else said below about the fit and drape, applies to the red one, as well.  "
"the red is like a school blazer, almost true crimson.  "
"so it's a darker red than 'classic', yet very nice.  "
"so for the red one, you do not want to tumble-dry medium, but low;  remove the shirt before it's fully dry, to minimize wrinkles and shrinkage.  "
"the red one's fabric, is a slightly thicker weight than the ones described below.  "
"wash it alone the first time, in case the dye will run.  "
"(it didn't run, when i washed it.)=======edit"
", wash report:  "
these shirts can be tumble-dried medium.  
"best to remove them while the fabric is still slightly damp, so all the seeming wrinkles will flatten out after hanging.  "
"there was no shrinkage, but then i didn't dry on high heat, and i machine-washed them in cold water using cheer."
edit:  
"liked this shirt so much, i bought all colors.  "
the 'dazzling pink' is really matte coral or (light)
salmon pink;  
"goes with coldwater creek coral jeans, what a surprise.  "
"not see through, substantial-weight cotton, thick turtle for the neck.  "
"the 'tulip pink' is really more of a light berry pink, sort of purplish, not fuschia.  "
"the latter is not made by only necessities, but is nice.  "
very comfortable against the skin.
original review follows below.=============really like this turtleneck.  
"it's well made, a tad thin (which is to be expected),"
but here thinness was what i wanted.  
"even so, it's very close to the thickness you'd expect in a quality turtleneck.  "
well-sewn.  
"best of all, it's made by only necessities, and i've been a fan of their stuff for years."
the color names are confusing.  
"their 'soft teal', but instead is a medium light blue.  "
"the 'rosemary' shirt here is not by only necessities, but it's also nice.  "
"its material is a bit thinner, more like a thin t-shirt; but, well-enough made.  "
picture color is accurate.
"both are true turtlenecks: you must fold the neck material in half, or scrunch it down.  "
"the neck seam is on the side, not in back (thank god)."
its a basic headset but with good sound quality.  
cannot go wrong with this headset.  
solid product.
works on all region 3ds and wiiu units.
does exactly what anyone willing to pay for a rare amiibo card to do...
the same exact thing a regular amiibo card would do.
"other than the look of the kk slider art, i don't believe it has any different functionality in-game than the other regular kk slider card."
really this is for collectors.
i got it for my kitchen.  
nice big size.
and i like that it looks distressed.
i wish they would add more pictures because the sign is amazing.
"manufactured very well with durable wiring, and delicate packaging."
very very satisfied with it.
these are cute and look real from a distance.
i have them in small decorative planters.
exactly as pictured and beautiful design.
fits as measured.
after trying several of the
oh my lubricants for comparison sake
", i found this one to be surprisingly just like blueberry cheesecake!  "
many lubes are sweet or fake sweet tasting
but this tasted just like cheesecake.  
my fiance likes the strawberry better but
either way they were very nice lubricants and reasonably priced.  
i definitely liked the bottle too as it was attractive and when it is done being used it could be reused somewhere else.  
i have recommended this to many of my friends and they like them too.
super easy to wipe clean!
have barely felt the heat with these
these are large sized faux limes.
i'm using them in a beautiful bowl on my island to bring in a pop of color.
very pleased.
these are everything!!!
"im 5'8"" and 175lbs"
and i have a big gut after 2 pregnancies and these are amazing at hiding it
exactly as described.
i found the blanks to have non-sharp edges and this worked great for me
perfect for my son's room!
i like that it zips up and
the design looks great.
this phone case is so adorable and it protects my phone so well.
i always get compliments on it.
the rubber is the perfect consistency and it gives a little bounce when you drop it.
(i've dropped my phone about 10 times).
"the screen protectors are handy too, i don't know about the cell phone bag."
it's elastic and form fitting and therefore hard to get out of the bag.
"it doesn't have a zipper, nor does it close."
but i would highly reccomend the case!
i bought before the dawn set of four and i loved them!
"it really was a great way to update the look of our black couch, thank you!"
bought these to raise a couch to help someone stand from it easier.
they did the trick.
these can both fit on one hand; they’re so little and cute and heavy!!
but even though they’re small; they hold alot of product.
very pretty and perfect for me.
kind of a burlap type fabric but softer
it’s nice just wish it had a bronze dispenser top.
"just the right size so that then can be used for cooking, and then brought to the table for adding more if desired."
love this wine rack!  
so cute.
adds personality and flair!
takes over a month to get to the us from china
but if your not in a hurry it’s worth it.

these covers are well made and look so good for the cost.
an easy and inexpensive way to change the looks of throw pillows.
"great detailing, nice weight.  "
2nd pair i have bought.
arrived fast and i like the quality and color
very nice rug.
fits perfect in my bathroom.
product arrived in great condition!
looks even better than what i thought it would!
novica is my favorite place for earrings..
incredible artist...love these elephants very sweet excellent quality!
"i have tried out several ropes recently to find one that is not only worth its money, but is functional as well."
surprisingly this is a well built rope for the price.
can't beat it really.
"if there is a downside to it, i would say that the weight is slightly heavier than i would like, but again, it's slight"
so i can't really complain.
i've used it for a few weeks and it is holding up well and has good spin for double-unders.
i'd say give it a go.
i got this product yesterday and i love it!
it's very pretty and
exactly what i'm looking for!
thinking of getting another one!
"you’ll know it’s fake, but it’s very pretty."
good purchase for the price.
great cd case!
it holds the disc nice and neat and not too bulky!
plus it matches my car perfectly!
this holder does exactly what it says it does.
"it holds the brush when it's full of paint when you need to move a ladder, answer the phone, or during any other interruption."
"it's also good for holding the brush when you are climbing the ladder, so you only have to hold the paint can, leaving one hand free."
we also found it works great for suspending the brush in paint thinner while cleaning it.
a great little product and highly recommended.
absolutely gorgeous and look real!
exactly what i wanted for the price and pattern....
i'm using this apple
i pad with the square i bought.  
fits perfect!
makes my room look way better.
going to buy them for all my rooms now.
great dies
"arrived quickly, packaged very well, very sturdy and look great in the kitchen."
good price for the money
purchased as gift.  
"seems like a quality product, heavy backing material and smooth face.  "
"the printed logo looks just like the original c7 one, sharp and well defined.  "
available in 3 colors.
awesome tablet so far so good wife loves it great upgrade from mini
i mistakenly ordered this cover for my kindle.  
"being new to the kindle world, i didn't take the time to discover that not all covers fit all kindles.  "
"i loved this cover, the material and the ""stand-up"" feature.  "
unfortunately it did not fit my kindle keyboard.  
darn!  
"i wish they made all covers to fit all the kindle models, as there is none anything like this for the keyboard model."
a dream to type on
just beautiful.  
love it.
this is such a pretty bracelet...
and i'm delighted that it had sufficient stretch to fit the wrist of a larger woman.  
"the scripture is quite legible, so it made the perfect gift for the group leader of our bible study.  "
"for the quality, it was very reasonably priced.  "
wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product
:).
we needed this for a sing out seussical that my daughter was participating in.
it didn't arrive as promised.
otherwise it is a cute hat.
"i wasn't sure what it would really look like when i ordered this, but wanted the sun and moon motif which represents my children."
"it was so cute, when i took it out the package that it became my favorite jewelry piece."
i hope to find matching pieces to it.
"and, i love the price."
its just awesome all around.
"uninova dog nail clippers, i use these on dogs and rabbits works as expected."
love this ipad-so easy and fun!!!
great fit
a little sheer on top
but it's very beautiful.
i got lots of compliments on it.
i love my new ipad!
"it’s fast, great new features and fun to use."
"main disclosure: i consider myself an audiophile, and quite frequently my ears can hear more than some earbuds offer, which ambient noises usually interfere with my enjoyment of my music."
addition as of 5/15/2019: i have accidentally ran these through the rough wash cycle my clothes go through once and the dryer twice because it takes two attempts to dry my clothes completely.
"point is, these things survived the wash with minimal damage inflicted, and almost no alteration to sound qualityso"
the beats are normal sounding if they are not warmed up to about body temp.
which is what most people are going to write about in comparison to other brands.
i learned rather recently that the beats work better
"(bass actually gets pretty good) when the temperature is raised by body heat, which is me saying keep it close to your skin."
"the full science relates to its impedance turning into electromagnetic field strength, where about 25 degrees upwards can nearly double it’s strength, which means it can bass better."
its performance is normal under cooler conditions in relation to the transducer contained within the earpiece.
"so my advice, if followed, will result in probably some of the best earbuds available at their price."
"and the tangle-free feature and remote function with apple devices only makes it really goodedit as of 11/25/2018: there was never a case that came with it, so storing"
"/carrying is a bit of a challenge, especially because it can still tangle if loose in one’s pocket."
i just reused another small carying bag for a different set of earbuds.
"as for durability, and i’ve read a review saying they suck on durability, the main three components are protected with what is either a really hard rubber-coated plastic in places, or just straight plastic."
but the stuff is tough.
"to bend the audio jack takes a considerable amount of force, let alone breaking it, which to me means someone put it in a rather tight spot."
"the bigger/looser the pocket, the better."
addendum 2/22/2019:
i created a clip for the line
so it immobilizes most of it
"so it doesn’t disrupt my music,"
"any earbuds with a “noise isolating” feature tends to do this, so i created a shirt clip that goes on the line pretty much permenantly and clips to anywhere around the collar of whatever you’re wearing."
"other than that the line does transmit sound from bumps and friction all too well and sometimes ends up being louder than the music, which is why i created the shirt clip."
"and for the love of god, pay attention to the science i wrote about."
the sound is crappy if not warmed up.
once raised to body temp (say a close chest pocket)
they’re really good.
the reason is the purity of the copper in the transducer in the driver of the earbud.
lower impedance (more pure copper) means less bass output.
raising the temp will fix that.
other earbuds like skullcandy can start of lower because of the lesser quality of copper.
edit 2/20/2019:
"so my ear canals typically require a larger size earbud tip, but i found sound was lacking for the most part."
"i tried a smaller tip set and shoved the buds deeper, which aounds like a dirty joke, but in all seriosuness, the full power of the urbeats have been revealed."
i also learned changing the setting of eq on apple devices to “small speakers” generates the best sound.
"location in relation to the eardrums makes an incredible difference, as more bass power gets lost as distance increases."
but my ipod nano 6th gen is the last remaining device that can use the 3.5 mm audio plug type.
"either way, superior sound to average run-of-the-mill earbuds."
skullcandy is a different story.
can’t seem to get a good comparison between the smokin buds 2 and these earbuds.
"skullcandy specializes in superior bass, but the clarity of sound in general holds better with the beats."
edit 3/20/2019:
i used these on a plane in comparison against active noise cancelling headphones.
skullcandy venue vs. these.
"these earbuds required less volume and came out with better bass quality on a flight, for two hours, against active noise cancelling over-the-ear headphones."
my experience was simple: active noise cancelling presses on my eardrums in the presence of very loud constant noises.
"the beats have nothing except passive noise isolation, which is like earplugs being bypassed by the buds."
meaning the noise was clearer and blocked out the noise of the engines of the plane.
edit 8/6/2019
: side by side comparison between these and the skullcandy smokin’ buds 2 yielded (again) less than desirable results for these.
"skullcandy has way more powerful base and seemingly less static white-noise under really quiet conditions, but the urbeats3 has the volume control in addition to the remote"
"(i really prefer wired earphones/earbuds because it’s strictly dependent on device power, which for earbuds can go for more hours."
so depending on which you wish to sacrifice (either remote volume control or sound quality/bass power)
i’d
high recommend these for wired earbuds with decent sound and volume
controledit
8/28/2019
: i finally got them on par.
only took over a year and a half.
apparently bringing ringer volume on an iphone/ipod to full actually brings earbud volume up as well.
my guess it
the volume control goes with the ringer volume for master control followed by music volume control.
"that means if ringer is up to max, the earbuds get louder."
"i will also point out they must sit just snug, not pressed in or too loose, to get the best sound quality"
i was under the impression that they came with the case that is also pictured with the item.
is that not true?
horrible sounddo not even bother
"the sound in these is amazing, what an upgrade switching to these!"
the color is nice and matte.
the packaging is very appealing as it closely resembles apple’s packaging.
i had no problem with the lighting connection.
i just noticed the backs of the buds are magnetic as well!
would like to purchase one of every color!
ok earbuds.
"however, i did not receive the case that was shown with them."
nearly perfect.
"as another reviewer noted, they are a great fit and provide stellar sound isolation without being noise canceling."
the cables are flat and light while the earbuds are magnetic for storage.
i’ve not experienced any tangling and there is slight cable noise (the sound that travels up the cable to the earpiece when brushed against).  
they would be absolutely perfect if they had a charging port like what is found on the pioneer rayz plus which allows you to charge and listen to music simultaneously on an iphone.
phone:
samsung galaxy s7.  
i recently purchased these at a good price.  
the headphones look great but
a few things that i was not too impressed about.1.  
the volume buttons were not compatible with my phone.  
in the instructions it even says some functionality may not work for android phones and that it's mainly for ios.  
the play/pause button down work
however so it's not a total loss.2.
know the type of earphones (shape) that work for your ear.  
i knew i always had issues with the shape of these types of earphones
but i thought i give it a try.  
they don't stay in my ear very well even trying the different ear pads.3.
sound quality is not great with these.  
my stock samsung earphones had better quality sound.  
it could be that they don't stay in my ears very well or the type of earphones they are.  
i'm sure the over-the-ear versions have better sound quality.
"the sound is pretty good, though a bit bass heavy (expected that with beats)."
i like that the headphones snap together through magnets and that the cords are flat; altogether this makes them unlikely to really tangle.
i also appreciate that the volume control as it gives me a great indicator for which bud is left.
"i'm happy with them, but that matte gold color looks pretty awful in person."
"""white person who smokes a lot skin color"" is a more apt name."
get a different color.
i’ve used beats my entire life
and i am just so disappointed.
i’ve been using these for 4 months and the right earphone already stopped working.
it came to my attention that the cable had some wrinkle(?)
-see picture-
when i first bought them
but i didn’t put a lot of mind to it since they worked well.
"bad choice, right earphone suddenly stopped working."
i’m
attaching pictures of my 3.5 mm cable
(i use those for my tablet)  
so you guys can see the difference
",  please avoid this product or at least the lightning cable ones (for iphone)."
might try bosé after this...
dissapointed
there is something about my ears that apple earbuds and the other types with a larger outer shape really hurt me.
"these fit perfectly out of the box, and the sound quality is amazing."
there is bass.
they fit so well that i can't hear a tv on at normal volume.
amazing bass.
"i also love that there is a lightning adapter to go straight into my phone, so i am not worried about the apple adapter eventually breaking."
"a+, you won't regret it, give these a try."
great value for $$.
"my wife and i have bought several of these beats earbuds, both the bluetooth and the 3.5mm version, but we normally get them at best buy."
this time amazon was a little cheaper
so i went with that.
i got the earbuds
and they are good
", they have great drivers with a nice low range and are decently comfortable, but this is the first time i received a set that did not include a nice silicone case to keep them in, nor did the packaging include the wingtips that help keep the earbuds in the ear."
"i don't know why they would cheap out on these things, or why my identical grey set from best buy would have them and not the red ones."
"it did seem weird that the red ones were cheaper than other colors, i would have paid more if they made clear it did not include the case and wingtips."
"not a huge deal, still got the earbuds themselves"
and they are good
"but without the wingtips its harder to keep them in the proper position in the ear, which means less bass and less seal to block out other sounds."
these earbuds are great.
they have great sound quality and bass.
they came with many size ear tips that will fit a lot of people.
the lighting connection works great.
very helpful especially when you don’t want to use an adapter
my only complaint is they push them selves out of my ear
"and i have to keep pushing it back in, but after a few times and adjusting it the way i want i can get it to stay."
"sounds great, works great!"
ordered the blue & coral too! 😍
the yellow is gorgeous!
not worth the price tag.
apple's inbox earpods are better.
"no bass, take my word for it."
it's better to buy the studio if u want a good beats or buy a cheaper brand which sounds just as good.
i purchased these so that i could be hands free at work.
we use iphones and there are no aux plug ins on the 8 and up.
i really like the coral color.
it stands out against my dark brunette hair so my coworkers know when i am on the phone.
sound quality is much better than any other earbud set i have had before.
these are also very comfortable which is big for me since the apple brand don't fit properly for me.
everyone that i have talked to on the phone using the microphone have mentioned how clear i sound and when i tested them with my husband he was unable to hear any additional wind or background noise.
i'm planning to get him a pair as well.
wow.
i am extremely disappointed.
the sound quality is awful.
the apple earphones that came with my phone sound much better.
don’t bother getting this product.
the material quality is great but other than that i am disappointed.
"when i purchased the beats urbeats3 earphones with lightning connector - black, i looked at on the pictures and thought i was receiving a single jack (the one with 3 rings around the tip)."
"to my surprise, i received the flat usb type connector."
i have an lg k7 android cell phone and the earphones are not compatible with it.
"again, based on the one photograph that displayed a black cord earphone with the single jack, that's the one i thought i would receive."
another photo had the usb type.
confusing to say the least.
"to add insult to injury, i cannot return the item because i threw out the package it a arrived it."
i paid for something i really wanted and cannot enjoy its use.  
not a very pleased customer.
"i recently purchased a number of in-ear buds, i have a tough time with fit.  "
if an earbud doesnt fit securely it will not sound right and will not produce the bass like a over the ear one does.  
these fit well
", controls are nice and they really sound amazing!  "
i was never a beats person as the tended to get by with their name and hype.  
these however live up to the hype.  
"bass is excellent, full sound, great highs, very impressed!  "
i tested these against imore 3 and 2 driver
and there was no competition.  
these are louder and have way better low end.  
i also had a pair of sony mdrxb50ap
extra bass
but they didnt hold up although not bad
just not as good.  
i am not a basshead either
but these are not overwhelming in the bass department
they are strong and you forget your are wearing earbuds and not cups.  
the only other pair i really enjoyed with these are status iem-2x.  
finallyi had a pair of klipsch r6i ii and they have nice highs but miss too much of the lows.  
so the beats and the status are staying as they also fit the best!
i've owned the powerbeats 3 and now these urbeats3
"and as ive expected,  they work like a charm."
"the sound quality is very nice, not too high on the bass and are very clear."
taking calls with them is easy and so far they seem durable
and i think they will last a long.
"the sound is good on these, but i honestly can't tell a major difference in the sound between these and the cheap panasonic headphones that i used to buy."
"i  bought beats because they were the only other option i had besides getting the non noise canceling apple headphones, or using the connector thingy to use normal non-lightning headphones (ugh, iphones)."
i'm also not willing to use bluetooth earphones.
"these have a weight to them that i had to get used to - at the beginning i felt like they were going to fall out of my ears from the weight pulling down, but they never did."
"also, these urbeats lasted me 1 year & 5 months."
i think my old cheap panasonic's would usually break around the 6 month mark.
"for my beats, the remote and mic stopped working, although i can still hear sound in the earphones."
i had to buy a replacement recently but at least they are actually cheaper now than they were when i bought them the first time- they used to be around $75 but
at the time i'm writing this
they're like $45
and now more colors are available.
luckily i also bought protection policy thing for it back then
so that was usefulthese are standard earbuds
but i wish i could still buy $8 panasonics .
the sound quality is comparable in my opinion and being that the urbeats were $75 when i bought them
i don't think they were worth that much.
"not sure if i still would say they're worth $45, but it's definitely a huge price cut 1.5 years later"
i bought this along with a headphone adapter for my iphone.
"the first issue i noticed right away was that none of the 4 included earbud tips would fit in my ears properly, and would constantly fall out while listening."
"two other problems that i had with them was that audio would only play out of the left ear and not the right, and the volume adjustment switch on the headphones just straight up"
wouldn’t work.
"however, that’s probably just an issue with my pair."
"with my experience with beats headphones in the past, i should’ve known better, but the reason i got these was because of a recommendation of the lightning version for these headphones in an austin evans video."
my disappointment is immeasurable.
and my day is ruined.
"i like the sound quality overall, however the earbuds constantly fall out of my ears, despite changing the sizing."
i've also only had the headphones for about a month and a half and they're already crapping out on me.
i bump my phone and the music will stop playing
so i have to unplug and replug the headphones back in to get them to work.
this never happens when i use my apple headphones instead.
i take good care of these headphones
so there's no possible way i could've damaged them after only having them for over a month.
i can't even return these crappy headphones
so i'm very disappointed in the money i spent.
"ok, so i used to had the urbeats 2nd gen and those where my favorite for a long time, and when i see this for only 39usd"
i say let's do
"it!it's important to mention that y used to have/own other brands (sennheiser, marshalls, sony, soundmagic, bossé) as well as"
"im a fan of high quality sound, so when they finally arrived.."
i was very disappointed.
i remember de 2nd gen with even better sound quality than this 3rd gen.
"it is a very poor quality on details, bass and in general sounds very cheap."
"also, i'm am android user, and the up and down buttons don't work, but this is something beats has always does, making it only appe compatible."
"well, i least i didn't pay too much for these."
🤷

♂️
pros:unique design that prevents tangling.
volume adjustment is functional.
"cons:not sure why, but earbuds started to irritate inside my ear.  "
never had this experience with any earbuds.
sound quality honestly sounds a bit worse compared to cheaper earphones from less popular brands i've previously bought.
no case.
conclusion:
"my honest opinion, not worth the money.  "
worth at most $20.  
better options out there!
"i like everything about this product, the bass the sound, and it fits wherever i put it"
", the packaging was amazing"
"it made me feel like i really spent good money on a product,"
overall the quality of these earbuds are amazing and i would recommend to everyone
i got these to replace the headphones that came with my iphone.
"the originals were hurting my ears after about a half hour of wear, the sound was not loud enough for me and overall just not that great."
"i wanted something that already had a lightning cable, a black cable and was louder."
i know beats tend to be much louder than most headphones as i’ve owned several pairs in the past.
so for the price i thought i would give them a try.
upon recieving  them i really loved the packaging.
"the headphones were what i was expecting, and after changing the earbud size i gave them a try."
i’m pleased to say that they were a good choice.
"the volume is definitely there, infact if i put it on max its too much."
"i don’t notice too much bass, as i typically would with a beats headphone which is kind of odd for me"
but that doesn’t bother me because i don’t like excessive bass in earbuds.
"the sound quality is very good,  "
but i feel they could be a little bit crisper.
"then again, for the price it’s satisfactory."
these are really terrible.
"i just wanted red earphones, and i'd be willing to trade some sound quality"
just so i can have red earphones...
but these are just really bad.
"i thought it was the new mp3 player i bought, but i switched to my razer headphones right after using these and..."
nope.
it's the headphones.
all the one star reviews about these earphone being worse than stock apple earphones is true.for a set of 50 earphones i would at least expect these to be somewhat decent...
these are pretty bad earphones.
if you don’t get a good seal in your ears they sound like garbage.
"the problem with that is that if they move at all, you lose the seal, and they move a lot."
who thought a flat cord was a good idea?
"it kinks, twists, and is too stiff for earphones sensitive to movement."
i gave these a few weeks of use and i would recommend just using the standard apple earphones.
"hey beats, try making some foam ear pieces like shure."
they mold to your ear and you don’t lose the seal when you move.
i have a brand new samsung s8
+
"and the volume buttons dont do anything on any application, music, youtube, nothing."
which sucks..
but the sound quality for only $50 is absolutely amazing.
i know beats are hated for their overuse of bass
but they really managed to tone it down a lot here while still keeping that rumble where its needed.
"putting them in with no music playing, it was already canceling the outside noise."
i couldn't hear much and my own voice was muffled.
so that's nice.
"and they go very loud but taking them out of my ear while playing music, doesnt seem that loud at all so you wont be disturbing the people around you."
i am very impressed with these just sad that the buttons dont work.
it even comes with a sticker and i love when companies do that
xd
it's the little things
beat lightning wired earphones on the market.
"the bass is loud, the volume is loud."
i could drown out outside noise with an ease.
these earphone from beats need to much love because they are good product.
"i was trying to buy these at best buy and other retailers, but everyone in my area was sold out."
"i knew from there, these earphone was gonna be a beast."
they didn’t disappoint.
i advise everyone who like bass and loud volume to buy urbeats 3 dam it!!!!!!!!!!!
👌
🏼👏🏻😁
🤨🤩🤬
"all in all, these headphones are mediocre."
"i appreciate that beats has lowered their  prices over the years, however compared to apple headphones, these headphones lose because they do not feel as comfortable and the wires tend to make noise when i move unlike the apple headphones."
"these headphones were not horrific, but for $50 i have to say ehhhh not that impressed."
before purchasing i read that some guy said that they take a bit to heat up
and then they can work at their full potential.  
"upon first using them, there was little bass."
"by that, i mean the amount i expect to receive from beats.  "
"another thing is, when i turn them up.."
"the highs really hit, i cannot listen with them like that for long because i know eventually it would hurt.  "
the only thing i am waiting to get out of these is to achieve the amount of bass i would like.
the sound cancellation is great!
recently i was on a job
(i am an audio engineer) and the sound system was quite loud.  
after a while my ears began to hurt from the music
so i decided to pull my headphones out and just stick them in my ears.  
i did not even plug them in.  
this drastically changed the volume and i was impressed from this.
"not a bot, honest review."
by far the worst product i've ever had.
the biggest complaint is that you can hear the vibrations every time the cords move.
the sound quality is way worse than the apple out of the box pair.
there is also no noise cancelation unless you jam them into your ear to the point where it feels like your ears are completely clogged.
i would have returned them if i hadn't taken them on a trip and had to use them for a week.
do not buy....
"they sort of heavy and uncomfortable, i am not sure why exactly"
but i don’t like how they feel.
i can feel them pulling me down.
all other earphones didn’t give me
that weird pulling down feeling.
i keep in readjusting the cable;
the only reason i bought these is because airpods do not fit in my ear or does apple headphones
and i do not have a headphone jack on my phone.
"this is a very good lightning headphones with a good amount of bass for iphone 7, 7+, 8,8+,10,10s,10s max, 10r.they come with multiple ear tips and wings for a good fit in your ear, and that is what i was looking for."
i can hear parts of songs i never could before with my earbuds !!  
can relay the base which sounds incredible.
i can even sleep with these in thanks to the different rubber adjustments that you can switch out on the headphones – i’d recommend that if you are trying to sleep with your headphones in that you get a silk pillowcase because you do have to kind of position your head a certain way with a standard pillowcase ; these can feel a little uncomfortable to sleep on otherwise .  
but with a silk pillowcase i can sleep on my side with these headphones in
and they don’t hurt my ears
and i can sleep through a man and a dog snoring simultaneously !!
🙌
anyone disliking these headphones just trying to get attention on the internet for no reason.
these headphones are excellent
my boi.
of course they gonna fall out sometimes
"bro, they are wired, idiot."
but listening to rap and just mainstream music with even average bass sounds
just n a s t y.
in a good way... i forgot how sick good bass feels coming from my airpods.
"also, the sound is just very immersive and isolating almost."
just god tier honestly.
i literally have them in my ear as we speak.
go ahead and add them to your cart and thank me later.
they're largely the same as urbeats 1 and 2 and has noticeable stronger mid section sound which i was not expecting since my experience with beats has been all bass and treble.
for best results use an equalizer (why wouldn't you to begin with) and build quality feels improved over older styles of urbeats.
l and r are not labeled from what i can tell but the side with the controls is left like previous models.
highly recommend!
sheesh
i should’ve paid closer heed to the sub-par reviews.
"i was hoping with the backing of apple and dr. dre, a wired pair of beats ear pods would have a great sound quality for what they are."
all the people that posted on here claiming the sound is “tinny” and sounds like something you can get from the dollar store are absolutely correct.
what a disappointment.
"i give them 2 stars because one star is the minimum, another star for comfort, noise cancellation, and for the blue color i ordered, cool design and looks."
no case to put them in?
boooooo!
as for the sound?
"negative 2 stars, but that’s not an option."
"these would be good for about $10, not $50 and certainly not the $100 they initially cost."
my apple airpods have a much better sound quality.
so very disappointed...
for the price (got them on sale) and quality
i was shocked
they were beats!
was expecting a knockoff
but they’re the real deal guys.
additionally since i have an iphone with no aux input
i’m glad they sold it compatible with the lightning cable alternative since the regular apple headphones don’t work for my small ears
(they constantly slide out no matter
how tightly and painfully i try to jam them in there).
awesome earbuds.
they were delivered in a sealed package in new condition.
i purchased the gold pair with the lightning type connector.
my only complaint is the color.
they are a light tan color with no gold in them whatsoever.
the magnetic surface where they stick together is the only gold you will find on the buds.
"other than that, definitely beige."
the case and extras (ear hooks and replacement buds) are a nice touch!
"these are great earbuds, best i’ve used, except... they’re almost disposable."
"my first pair had the sound quit on the right side on the right ear, when i paused hulu with the remote.  "
my second pair bent where the cable enters the lightning jack after they got tangled in a desk chair
and i dropped my phone trying to untangle them.
"but, they’re also a great product, they have better sound quality than even my skull candy earbuds for my ipad 6th gen."
they truly are tangle free because of the magnets that are on the back of the earbuds where the beats logo is.
i love these earbuds
and i will be replacing them again.
this is the first beats product that i've bought and it will be my last.
"i cannot stress enough how bad, quite literally absent, bass response these ear buds have."
these are so tinny.
"i'm using spotify, base boost, have messed"
w/ the equilizer etc.
etc.
absolutely terrible bass response.
don't bother.
"i'm hoping i got a pair of duds, as i simply cannot believe all of the glowing reviews for this product."
purchased as a gift for our daughter's new iphone.  
she has used many different brand's of headphones and said these are by far the best and her favorite's.  
i'll take that as a 5 star review any day!!!  
they match her yellow iphone perfectly.
i’ve been using beats for a few years
"and i just don’t know if they changed who makes them, but they don’t last as long as i’m used too."
"the first beats i bought lasted me a 8 months, but it seems lately they just break faster and faster."
"by break, i mean the right side stops working."
i use a rubber case to hold my headphones in
"and i take good care of them, but they still broke."
i bought a new pair on march 20 and they broke in mid may.
i bought another pair and sent my old ones in because it has a one year warranty with apple.
apple just sent it back ...
still broken.
not fixed.
"so, i guess one year warranty is worthless."
really frustrated that i spent money on something that is supposed to last longer then 50 days.
these are really not very good.
"the sound feels like it's far away, clarity is average at best, and you can hear the cords swinging under the earbuds."
they earpieces also don't fit well.
i'm using the small ones
"and they still pop out of my ears unless i jam them in there with a full vacuum effect in my ear canal, and even then one of them likes to still pop out."
they fall of my ears
"great sound, especially with bass-heavy music."
"feels super comfortable in-ear, and noise cancels decently."
color also matches image.
my last pair lasted a year with rough use/a trip through the washer and dryer.
i'm sure these will last way longer with gentler care.
"play/pause button and mic works with my samsung galaxy s6 but the volume up/down buttons don't, which really isn't a big deal to me, but just stating it for anyone who may prioritize the feature."
several people have told me they can hear me better with this mic vs. other earbuds' mics and even the phone's regular mic.
overall great product and will be my go-to earbuds
if/when this pair needs replacement.
"these are comfortable in your ears, but for the price i feel like my $15 sony earbuds produced better quality sound."
not super impressed with these at all.
"the bass quality sounds like a speaker that is about to blow out and the audio is not very loud, even with the volume up."
"they cancel noise better than my sony’s, but i can still hear people talking around me."
don’t waste your money.
"bought 2 sets (1 for me, 1 for my husband)."
we each have different hearing levels and needs.
neither of us got a good sound from these.
it was frustrating
felt i could have gotten the same result from the airplane free set.
"they kept falling out (tried different covers), tried shoving in further which altered the sound."
i was hoping for something better but didn't want to spend a fortune and don't like the extra large over the head type.
"i read the lengthy review about warming up, and all the issues there."
not a fan.
these have the sound of $1.99 drugstore earbuds.
i thought i was treating myself to something special — they are terrible.
tinny.
no bass.
going right back to amazon.
awful sound.
very flat.
any $5 earbud sounds better than this.  
even the white apple earbuds that come with the iphone sound better than these.
and the apple earbuds are terrible.  
i have many beats products and they all sound really good.  
what happened apple?
it's a shame apple has pushed beats to the side and are not even trying to create a quality product.
i've had another set of beats for almost 8 years that are still kicking strong!
but i needed another pair that i didn't have to use the apple adapter with
", i was amazed to find that beats had a set!"
"i love these headphones, beats are probably the only set of headphones i'll ever buy."
the sound quality is above par.
overall i am very happy with this new set.
i paid $120.00 8 years ago for my first set so the price on these was a great surprise.
can’t really complain about anything for the price point!
and on a motorcycle at a prolonged 100mph on the highway they stay in my ears with no hooks or anything!
i was surprised!the
only grip i might have is that the highs aren’t as good as they might be in a more expensive pair of earbuds
but you really won’t notice much.
bought these for use with a new iphone.
after less than a month (but after enough time that the return window has passed) they're trash.
"they will work for 3-4 minutes at a time, and then randomly stop."
i'm very disappointed--
i've bought $5 headphones at the drugstore that lasted longer than this.
i love these.  
they don't tangle
", they sound great and they also work great for phone calls.  "
i prefer the earbuds over the apple type because they are more comfortable.  
this was my 2nd pair as i accidentally broke my last ones.  
i was hesitant to buy refurbished
but they have worked out great!.
excellent ear phones lots of base many little things even more expensive
ear plugs don’t have.
i plan on soon buying another pair in a different color.
i highly recommend these ear plugs.
also very comfortable to wear
i sleep with them listening to music on my phone every night
perfect for everyday use.
this is my second pair.
i wear them everyday for work in a medical environment.
first pair lasted a year due to having to be in my scrub pockets all day.
the wires slowly disconnected from the lightning port.
similar to what happens with iphone chargers.
"because headphones break, the less you spend per pair, the better off you’ll be."
"i bought two pears , and only one pair still works."
i prefer my sony wi-c310 pair to
beats x.
"these kept falling out of my ear, the battery was unspectacular, they broke, and the my would lose my phone’s signal when my phone was in my pocket."
can’t recommend.
i’m not sure what the hype is in these.
first off they won’t stay in my ears.
no matter the size pad
"i use the my fall out, even if i’m sitting and slightly move my head."
never before with any ear buds have i had this problem.
i went back to my good old apple ear buds.
sorry
beats
i’m not a fan.
"any time the cord touches something (your skin, clothes, furniture...), it creates a ridiculous amount of noise that mixes with the sound/music."
"if the cord does not touch anything (which is unpractical to maintain for even a minute), sound is good --but"
that's too big of an if.
"i cannot believe this product is sold as is, and i'm quite annoyed given the price point."
don't bother with this until they fix this flaw.
"i love these so much, i’ll never go back to regular earbuds!"
buying some for my teen and also as gifts for other family members.
i’d bought dozens of regular earbuds
but they would always break within a few uses.
not these!
plus the sound is 100% better.
"i wanted to have these just in case my wireless headphones died, but i should have just bought a back up pair of the wireless ones."
these headphones are constantly distorting the sound
and i'm constantly having to wiggle the cord trying to rectify it.
i purchased these headphones for my teenage daughter in may.  
they have stopped working in one ear.  
i contacted amazon and
they said i had to go to apple for warranty coverage.
i contacted apple and they told me there isn't anything they can do about it unless i can provide a bill of sale with a serial number.  
"seriously, a serial number on a pair of ear buds?  "
"needless to say, we are rather disappointed with the service from both amazon and apple.  "
"we have always recommended both companies to friends and family because they have stood behind their products in the past, now i'm not so sure."
had potential but doesn't fit in my ears well even with all the attachments.
does not cancel noise at all.  
"only reason i bought was because of the lightning connection and the beats ""reputation""."
comes with a cool sticker and nice packaging if you're into that????  
i'll stick with my $11 panasonic earbuds & just get a headphone lightning adapter.
earphones didn’t stay in the ears.
i bought these when they first came out and loved them.
i decided to buy the same exact one again since i had lost my previous ones.
i’m not sure if these are knock offs or refurbished because their definitely not the same.
they’re missing the wingtip earbuds and the case my original beats brought.
the mic is also 3 inch away from your mouth yet my voice goes in and out constantly.
to make any type of call i have to place the mic practically on my mouth and that’s extremely frustrating
considering
beats headphones aren’t cheap.
on the other their sound quality is just as great.
with all the bad reviews
i guess i’m one of the lucky ones who had a great experience with these.
"i still use these all the time, and i love how they match with my blue xr (which was definitely the point when they made these)."
in terms of quality i love the sound.
"it’s all subjective so anyone who’s put off by the reviews that say they sound bad, i recommend you give them a try anyway."
unless you are an audiophile the average person will enjoy these
maybe i was expecting too much for 45 bucks.
these headphones feel like 20-25 dollar headphones with the fancy brand attached to it.
i fell for it meh.
the sound quality isn't great at all
and they don't stay in my ears that well.
i guess i will keep looking and maybe fork over a few more dollars to get better quality.
these pair of beats is a great value for the price.
i have bought and was gifted the beats decade collection
and this was the last item on the list.
i didn't think i'd use them much.
but now they're my go-to headphones.
when i'm at work or playing on my nintendo switch or online on playstation.
there is a little bit of a pain if you don't have a headphone jack on your phone or missed placed the adapter.
but i recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of wired headphones and you want bluetooth pair
i recommend the beats x
awesome sound for small product!
i have beats speakers in my car and these earbuds pack the same punch!
noise cancellation is exact.
had a fire drill at work in a noisy wharehouse
didnt even know till a coworker waived me down.
great deal!
i actually enjoy these a lot more than what i thought!
they are really nice!
the noise is amazing and the sound cancellation is awesome!
a little more than your average headphones
but you get what you pay for and these are definitely worth it!
i love these beats!!!
the sound is great.
the bass and treble is what i think music should sound like.
i listen to just about every array of music and have never thought that sound wasn’t superb.
i also wear these to the gym
and i forget they are in my ears.
"the only complaint i think i would have, is i wish the gold were more gold-ly."
"overall, i would buy them again if i lost my current beats."
they met my expectations
love these.
the buds are magnetic and stick together which is perfect.
"the only thing is that it is difficult to change out the rubber buds, the trick is to pinch the rubber part when you put it on"
and it goes on pretty easily.
"just as advertised, i would recommend them to anyone!"
these are my first beats headphones
and i wanted them for when work around the house and yard.
i like the in ear headphones cause they don’t slide out of the ear while moving.
they were shipped in original beats packaging and 3 extra sets of rubber ear pieces.
i trust the seller and i would definitely be ordering another one to have as a spare.
sound of those headphones are terrible and flat.
unfortunately can't return because the person who uses them is out of the country
and i just learn how low quality sound comes out of them and way after return policy date
((((
i use these with my kindle… they’re much better than cheap headphones
"… the sound quality is a lot better… the part that goes in your ear is kind of big, so the fit isn’t that great…"
but i make them work
volume goes and down when button is pressed.
noise comes out of holes at nice speed.
i don’t think they cancel any noise
so i just turn it up louder to drown out my boss telling me to remove them.
"love that they have the lightening connecter, no more dongle to carry around!excellent sound!"
disappointed that i had to order a case separate but love the ear buds
my son asked for these and he loves them.
he said they have great sound and are comfortable to wear.
"sounds pretty good, and it even the packaging looks great."
horrible sound.
"all i’ve heard is how awesome beats sound quality is, so i spent the money to get a new pair of earbuds."
they make a $2 gas station set sound amazing.
"these have no bass, and everything sounds flat."
returning immediately.
"if you like quality sound, do not buy these."
"the sound quality is pretty decent, but the issue is that the sound is a lot more louder in one earbud opposed to the other."
i felt as though the urbeats 2 were definitely better in terms of sound and noise cancellation.
this product however pales in comparison and was not worth 50+$.overall
i would say buy a different version of beats or go for another brand.
"i’ll continue giving updates as i just received this product, but so far i’m not impressed."
these are ok quality and they are loud
but they aren’t very noise canceling.  
i also ordered silver
but they are grey not silver.  
looks a little cheap.  
all in all they are ok.  
they are loud and shipping took a day.  
very pleased with the packaging.
daughter picked these for her birthday and she loves them.
they have really good sound.
made well.
she never takes them off haha
must be that good!
recommend for price and quality
"used for the daily commute, music quality is amazing depending on what app you are using on the iphone."
this perfectly blocked out conversations
a few seats away and is low profile so no big head phones to lug around.
even with the smallest ear bud attached it didn't fit solidly in my ear canal and it would fall out after 5-10 minutes while watching a movie on a plane.
needs to have an even smaller bud option.
authentic beats
i was able to register them.
good sound i use them daily after a couple of months of heavy use
i can tell the cord might get weak and eventually start tearing.
"when they are in tight they have a nice bass, but within minutes they get loose and lose the bass.  "
i've tried all the different size attachments but no luck.  
maybe good
"if you're super still, but not that great while working out."
"they were kinda bad, i don't know if it was that i was expecting too much..."
they do not have any bass and
"when i go max volumen, they sounds weird..."
"another item i won't even bother to return, just a waste of time and money."
i'll use them until they die..
"excellent quality, arrived on time!"
"don't listen to all the bad reviews saying ""blah blah blah no sound and horrible!"
""""
that's not true at all.
they just don't know the proper fit.
with the proper fit the sound it great!
also they are noise canceling!
can't hear a thing with them in.
"great earbuds, a must have!"
"i've had 50 dollar headphones before, and they were way better."
"this par of beats had terrible noise isolation, and volume."
wouldn't recommend.
it’s not confortable and keeps falling from the ear.
"cutting to the chase - these earphones are not cheap, these phone have a mic, well, the mic is terrible."
"people will only hear background noises, voice cuts off, fades, just terrible to be comprehended from the other side."
extremely disappointed as an earphone for everyday use.
don’t feel the best in ur ears and don’t stay in too well but other than that they aren’t bad
"while these are very aesthetically pleasing, i’m not sure why there are so many reviews about how great the sound quality is."
personally i found it to be subpar.
"i expected more from beats, i love my solo3s."
the only good thing was the bass.
"these are a waste of $70, my $40 skull candy headphones blow these away."
this was horrible.
i use my headphones on the bus almost everyday
and i have a hard time hearing the sound over...anything!!!
someone could literally scrap their shoes against the pavement and i would know.
i have to blast the volume up to basically deaf times in order to not hear anything.
i still end up hearing something one way or another.
pity the fool who would use these ina.
"airline flight, thinking it would do the job."
have fun going deaf.
llego en buen estado y funciona muy bien.
brought these as a surprise for my daughter.
she does not like big bulky headphones.
she loves the sound quality and the ease of use.
this is a phenomenal pair of ear buds with noise cancellation for under 50 bucks.
clear sound and a great bass sound.
must buy!
"absolutely love these, put them in and cant hear anything other than whats playing thru my phone."
definitely worth every single penny
son loves these
i use beats with my ipods.
great sound and depth.
very comfortable.this is my second set and got the price they are a really good buy!
daughter loves these headphones and they come with a nice carrying case.
"look nice, sound nice and fit perfectly."
and they’re magnetic!
great sound quality!
it sounded like the sound was in the whole room when i was just wearing earbuds.
highly recommend!
thank you so much my son loves these got
11-8-2019so thankful
he got em even though post delivery was a day late
but he does appreciate it
the heandphones that came with my phone sounded much better than these.
"no bass, and extremely distorted."
pros:- color- magnetic buds keep together- durable- great audio qualitycons:- will need to switch out earbuds for other included buds b/c
these things are not one-size-fits all
"they are great, just hope they could come with a carrying pouch."
"other than that, they are amazing, the sound is great for what they are."
i mean just remember they are beats after all.
not a fan.
very big and heavy.
bulky and the sound is not so great.
skull candy are easy and much more comfortable.
better sound.
"i'm sad, i was so excited too."
super loud
and they are beats
best earphones i got so far and only for iphone
i purchased these in august and they were perfectly fine until the other day (april)
they just stopped working.
i would plug it into my iphone and the music would play from my phone only.
online with apple now to see if it’s even worth repairing.
recommend for everyone
recently order these headphones an love them!
"i was a little hesitant about not ordering them straight from the beatz website, but after getting them i am really happy with the product."
really great sound quality!
super happy with my order!
i like these a lot.
the sound is clear and the bass is good.
i use these at work and they cancel out the noise well.
they are also magnetized and stick to the metal walls great.
i bought one and they broke after 2 days then replaced them and the second pair didnt work at all.
extremely disappointing
not a quality item compared to the price
love them they work great
i bought 3 more for gift
and they loved them as well.
highly recmooned
kinda disappointed with the sound quality.
"since apple bought the company, the sound quality has suffered."
sounds flat.
super bright!
my son loves all things yellow
so i bought these.
convenient fit for iphone plug in.
do not need the adapter anymore for headphones.
great price.
sound quality is awesome.
i have had these since march of last year.
"sound is great, no cable tears"
but tell me why the b symbol/logo on the side of the plugs is sliding off?!
"i’ve kept them in a cool dry headphone case- not the one shown in the pics because it didn’t come in it just like other reviewers have stated, but why is the symbol/logo sliding off??"
they volume control never worked.
"it good quality, but cant control the volume at all."
solid product for the money.
"not noise canceling by any means, but the sound of that comes through is great for the price."
this product is junk.
"not worth $10, not even close to worth what they charged for it."
literally sounds like super cheap headphones.
and the microphone is pure trash!
i don’t know where to start.
"the headphones are nice, pretty, and the sound quality is brilliant."
but uhh problem.
"don’t buy it if you like to sing, and or use the mic."
it sucks.
badly.
for the price i paid i was expecting an overall quality too bad
tho
i bought some cheap ass headphones with terrible sound quality and an amazing mic.
is it to hard to have both?
what a waste of my money.
none of the ear buds fit my ear.
when i tried to use it without the buds they just kept falling out of my ears.
purchased this product and using it for  a week now.
have to say - the bass and the sound quality is exceptional.
purchased this product and using it for  a week now.
have to say - the bass and the sound quality is exceptional.
very poor audio quality.
far inferior to the cheapest apple earbuds.
returned.
"i've used other beats headphone before, but this, is a little disappointed, no bass, didn't feel any different from the original iphone earphone."
not yet a year and the left ear bud no longer works and all of the wings broke.
how does soft plastic/silicone break?
do not buy these earbuds.
great quality.
washed them twice and still work
so that say a lot about the quality.
sound is good and cancels noise
these headphones are amazing.
deep bass and great range for in ear headphones.
also the yellow is awesome.
highly recommend them.
"i like these so much, i bought an extra to have in case another pair was lost or stolen.  "
"however, these did not come with holder, as my prior ones did, which was disappointing."
was very let down by this product.
"sound quality was tinny, dynamic range awful"
i was extremely excited when i got these
but then i tried to use these as a mic on my ps4
all you heard was a loud beeping\buzzing sound
so i got my galaxy s9 and plugged them in the mic and volume buttons
would not work
i was very disappointed....
the only devices that these beats earbuds (mic/volume buttons) work with are ios devices
such a disappointment
these headphones sound great.
with the beats brand you know you're going to get a quality product.
would definitely purchase again.
"great sound, very sturdy."
had purchased these for my boyfriend on valentine's day.
he was always complaining that his were breaking left and right no matter how expensive after a few weeks.
he does construction so very hard on them.
it is now september
and we still have not had any problems with them.
love!
definitely worth the money
beats is always the best
"i love the colour and the sound is nice, but when you move around, the rubber of the headphones rub together and make a really ugly painful squeaky sound in your ears and it’s not pleasant."
i was hoping these would be comfortable to put in but even the smallest of the earbud replacements still hurt.
very comfortable headset.
muffles outside noise does not cancel it out.
very clear sound and microphone very good too.
"manufacturer produces headphones for android, that actually does not fully work for that system."
"having such product, but unable to use volume controls."
illogical
"music is my life and these are the best buds on the planet ,huge base ,great sound"
"fits great, did not tangle and great sound control!"
music the way it was intended to be heard.
"overall they are great,great sound, look, and noise cancelatoon."
the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i always break them after a couple months.
but i do that with all my headphones
ap atleast these last longer than a couple weeks like the cheaper brands i used to get
but i wish they would last me longer for the price
these are the ones i use for working out!
wish i found them sooner.
sound is amazing and they are very comfy!
just a couple complaints.
the cable is short & it doesn’t come with a case.
beside that there great
the earbuds them self fantastic great sound
the noise cancellation is top notch but
quality horrible 2 days in the part you plug in to your phone
is already showing bare wire which is not good.
i’ve always been a beats customers
i’ve had the orginal beats headphone the solo hd
then the solo 2 now
i have the solo 3 wirelsss which are amazing but these earbuds quality is horrible
it works great
i don't want to say its overrated.
but its overrated.
just decent overall.
i really
like these
and the color is great!
great sound quality!
"dope color but darker than i wanted it to be, still cute tho"
right earphone stopped working after six months.
"not eligible for mail-in submission for warranty service because there was not a serial number on the product, and i did not keep the packaging which supposedly includes the number."
nice headphones.
so far they are durable.
it's unfortunate that apple changed the configuration for headphones for the new apple iphones.  
problems with headphones actually working with phone calls... stops in the middle of a call forcing the drop and dial back in for conference calls.  
too expensive to not be the quality needed.
comes with different ear bud covers which allows you to pick the best ones for comfort.
the ear buds connect with a magnet when not in use which keeps them from getting tangled.
great product and you noise reduction is awesome
they won’t stay in your ears.
they constantly fall out unless you shove them in to the point of hurting.
then they may stay a minute.
fake reviews?
great product--no complaints here.
"i got the blue colored beats earphones and the pictures show a pastel blue but the actual headphones are water blue, a much darker blue."
if you get the red and black version then you get the case because its the decade edition
"so i will come with a red case, so if you want a case get the red and black ones"
there’s nothing not to like.
wish there was a carrying case.
"product is not what i expected, ear buds won’t stay in the ear."
music sound muffled.
regret buying them.
daughter loves these.  
the sound is perfect
"if you buy the gold ones, be prepared to have tan colored headphones."
"they sound great, but they are seriously ugly."
sad face.
works great and delivered quickly!
it’s actually really good.
doesn’t tangle at all
"and it has an amazing bass, noise canceling and fits in my ear nicely."
the item arrived just as described and in a brand new beats box.
the sound and quality are 5 star!
ear pieces for all style ears and wear options.
bass you expect from a pair of beats.
flat cord never tangles.
exactly as described
so i sent back some powerbeats which was wireless.
these are so much better.
this is a great value and has a lot of bass.
you won’t be sorry.
im gonna buy some more
not sure why someone cant make a set of ear buds that work well with android.
having a hard time getting a good fit.
don't have the good base sound if there's not a solid snug fit.  
beats 1 were the best.
sounds great
best earbuds by far.
good stuff
the sound quality is in line with all of the other beats headphones!  
"i wear these under my motorcycle helmet, riding my mt."
bike and while at the gym.
"easy to use and store away, great sound!"
nice earbuds (as expected from beats)
but i'm not personally crazy about the angled shape.  
i'll get used to it.  
it doesn't effect sound quality or comfort; just different.
my son ioves the headphones.
quality is superb look and sound.
it cuts out noise while in use.
the magnetic ends are an added bonus.
it cuts out noise while in use.
the magnetic ends are an added bonus.
exactly what was expected for quality and sound
"for unknown reasons, i didn't receive the wing tips."
"but i love how they sound, the amount of base is just what you need, love the design, love the magnet"
great
good
i love these beats headphones!
i use them to watch hulu on my ipad
and it cancels out all the noise around me.
the best feature is that the cord don’t tangle since the ear pieces stick together with magnets.
comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
awesome!
nice but expensive but works great
i like the sound and all but
the color is meh-
it says satin gold
but it looks more like dirty vanilla or car interior beige.
it is only important because i wanted a fun color my kids wouldn't take off with.
i got it
"half right, they won't take them."
the fit and sound are great.
love them
received an old pair of beats headphones without lightning jack that were also broken.
working perfect
as described
"this set of earbuds does not control ipod shuffle, nor android phone."
"my old set broke, version 2, these are version 3 and are useless on both of my devices."
i wish they would make it clear these are not compatible with older apple devices nor android phones....
great product
got them for my son..
he love them..
the sound quality is fantastic and since i just got them
i forgot i had them in my pocket...
washed and dried them.
still work perfectly.
do not wish too
these do not last.
they where great for about a month
gift for our son and he loves them.
these earbuds are so good that with medium volume most noises around you cant be heard noce buds overall
thanks!
... if you shove them deep into your ears.
they got here super fast after i ordered them and had great sound.
the noise cancellation is pretty nice and they are overall decent headphones.
i had only had them a week and have used them maybe 3 times and the right earbud has already stopped working.
the ear buds make these headphones so comfy for extended periods of use!!!
"great loud and clear sound, too."
haven't even had to turn them up all the way.
the backs of the buds are magnetic to each other.
helps keep them neat and together when not using!
i get nothing to say it’s get me speechless 😶
i would recommend5
star ⭐
️
"well sturdy, well engendered in-ear buds."
the headphones are very nice .
well i have had great experiences with beats normally but
this time i didn’t even receive them.
my package was actually stolen
but i have actually owned a pair of these before and they were awesome!
i just happened to lose that pair.
highly recommend!
this product is of poor quality.  
"the sound was poor, made of cheap material that quickly falls apart.  "
the adjustable ear phones were of poor quality as well.  
would not recommend to anyone!
these earbuds are great except for the big problem that the left earbud died less than 6 months after i purchased them.
so now i have to buy a new pair of headphones that will not be these as i (reasonably) expect both headphones to last far longer.
"these are terrible ear buds, was too much treble and zero bass"
no matter how hard i stick them in my ears.
apple earphones from 2009 sound way better.
do not know why apple invested in inferrer quality.
"sorry i bought these, will burn them"
the material isnt as nice as my white and gold ones.
very stiff and the white ones were very soft.
also they did not come with a case and the sound quality was disappointing.
the only issue with them is that they fall off your ear
ans have to constantly push them back in
"pretty awesome for the price, it use to be over a hundred back in the day."
i’m in love!!!
they do not stay in ear.
overall a 10
blocks out sound amazingly!
i love these ear buds!
love them!
"comfy, like the fact that it came with multiple plugs to interchange."
magnet
ear phone are a plus
sound quality is horrible.
the headphones keep popping out of my ear.
i’ve tried all the sizes that it comes with.
i think i will stick to just the actual beat earphones they are far superior.
"great sound, thanks"
great choice for the people that don’t like the extreme noise canceling thing
", i walk a lot in the city and need to know what’s happening around me while i enjoy a good podcast or song."
at the moment my favorites with lightening port.
not great.
"the magnets stick to everything, sometimes is a pain."
the rubber stuff case that comes with it is less than.
these were perfect.
"i love the color, and good quality for the price."
i’ve had these for about a month and they still work great.
the sound quality is really good and they block out most noise around you.
get these if want a pair of headphones that will last a while.
"amazing sound quality, great noise canceling although quite a bit of wire noise."
"great looking, great fit."
i’ve usually been against flat cord designs but these seem to work great.
i’ve had them for a little over a month now
and i use them every day.
the bass is pretty good as well
but i’ve had better.
don't fit ear as well as older ones
"i had the new ones have got that curve in them, hear outside noise because they don't fit well"
they are very comfortable to wear.
especially for long periods of time.
theirs so smooth and sound quality is amazing!
my daughter says these fall out of her ears too easy
only wore a couple times.
meh.
same quality as $10 earbuds.
"they stick together with magnets which is pretty cool, but if you’re looking for good sound"
i’d look elsewhere.
"i returned it, it didn’t fit my ears"
as expected
the cable started to curl after a few weeks and would never straighten out.
after less than six months the wire at the lightning port started to come loose inside and one earbud stopped working.
it's a garbage headphone for $44.
the sound quality of these beats were great.
loved them.
"i like the beat, of the beats.  "
they always get the job done.
they could have a little better clarity but they are in ear
so the sound will always be a little off.  
good buy for inear.. happy face!
nice
these are absolutely horrible
i just used them for the first time and want to return them .
earbud volume loud from left earpiece but soft on right.  
returned them the same day i received them.
i loved these ear buds so much but for some reason the left
ear bud doesn’t seem to work anymore
i have looked online on how to fix this and have not had any success yet.
i’m just sad that they broke so fast.
lasts a year.
to the day.
have had 6 pairs.
average.
but can’t do wireless.
great product at a great price and super fast shipping
these are great.
mic picks up great audio too when i need to record.
"i was shocked about this headphones, the quality and the sound..."
fits perfect!
the sound is very good.
the price quality relationship
it is perfect!
simply not impressed.
great for price
they are everything you are expecting from noise cancellation.
but if you need it for working out then i would get cordless.
"these headphones sound good, if you are just sitting there."
but to run with them they are pointless and do not stay in the ears.
will be returning.
"didn’t come with pouch, i odersd these because i have the iphone xr , they could use some work ."
works great with proper fitting earbuds.
they are great headphones but the volume down button broke.
"since then they have been fine, i’ve accidentally washed them 2 times and they went in the dryer too"
and surprisingly they sound better than they did before
these come with different size earbuds to prevent them from falling out of your ears.
literally everyone of them does not work.
it is annoying and i am very unhappy with the amount of money they cost.
excellent option
they came in early
i was exited
but they don’t work at all
i plug them into my phone and nothing very disappointed literally came broken :(
work great!
great sound!
cute color!
absolutely love these :)
"my son loves them plus most headphones break in a week or two, but these have lasted longer than all the others."
so right out off the bat
the sound quality wasn’t great.
the fit is uncomfortable.
and within a week the right ear pod stopped working
quality all day easy listening lots of extrasevan comes with a sicker b by dre
bass not as good as my previous ones.
staticky after a while.
great just mission to put together and to put in ear
great product
it is good product
"horrible, when i got them one of the first things i noticed was that the cord was bent so much was making the sound lag, and for some reason the cord was cut till the point i could see the wires"
broke a week after i purchased.  
awful product.
waste of money.
they were great at first but after a couple months they stopped working
love it!!
bad fit.
sound was too much bass.
got these because the ones that come with my iphone never stay in my ear and don’t have the best sound quality
but these are amazing and are comfortable.
highly recommend
great
but you can hear thuds if something disturbs the earphones
it’s not the best for the gym but good headphones overall
love them
super loud and wonderful noise cancellation.
one of the most overrated and overpriced headphones in the market
total letdown.
no where near the sound quality of my last pair of beatz(which were close to 10 years old).
i'd expect a newer model to be better...
but no.
"always wanted these and now that i have them, not disappointed!"
"i never liked the apple pods, and i needed these for when i have to charge my wireless."
the buds hurt my ears
stopped working after less than a year and the people at beats told me to hit the road.
good
i was using these in class and there was a fight between two people
and i didn’t even notice until i felt the vibrations coming through the floor and on to my feet.
great product.
son cómodos
great quality but not noice cancelling earphone
good
tough to stay in yuour ear
very good earphones love the flat wire and magnetic earbuds sound
is good
great
they changes them so they now have an angle
and i cannot interexchange them between ears.
they are fantastic headphones!
these are really good quality headphones!
i accidentally put them through the washer and dryer and they still work like new!
i wouldn’t recommend doing that though 😂
bought as a gift for my girlfriend .she
haven't had it for a year and mic stop working already.
i love them.
broke in 2 months good quality but fragile
best sound quality of any pair of earbuds
i’ve ever tried.
"very noise canceling and very comfortable in the ear, definitely recommend"
these are for a kid not an adult on the go.
bought these for riding motorcycle.
sometimes i forget to charge mybeatsx.
these are just as good
"honestly love them, they are loud and sound great for the price!"
need refund
comparados con los que vienen en
la caja
"del iphone estos audifonos son de excelente calidad, la cancelacion de ruedo es pasiva, pero funciona"
love these!
it sounds perfect!
"really good, last long."
only thing is i can't seem to control the volume.
no sound one side at two months.
of course that’s
past return date.
for some reason i saved the box.
apple warranty will hopefully fix them.
buyer beware!
perfect
nothing really to dislike.
has very good sound for low end beats.
like that tangle free cord.
definitely satisfied.
the earphone is comfortable to wear and the sound is awesome.
the price is pretty decent as well.
"overall, great product."
"great quality for the money, great started pair of era phones my son."
i was impressed how great they sound.
i mean come on there
beats were talking about 😂😂
surprisingly good for the price i thought it was gonna be some ripoffs
but they are straight
missed amazon return window by 10 days....
eh kinda good
i have better $40 wireless headphones
so i’m going to return these
satisfied.
good earphones.
using it for playing xbox.
each phones can sticks together because has magnet.
i wish the earbuds were a bit louder to drown out noise like the headphones
these earphones are great.
i brought these for my daughter in april now they stopped working
but they are good quality headphones they just don’t last long
not a fan of these buds sound is horrible ...
i prefer the beats tour 2 sound way better than these not worth 50 bucks
not a single complaint.
accidentally washed and dried them and they still work perfect
love the sound but earbuds don’t fit or stay in as well as my old set of beats
so far so good.
great sound.
love the additional ear buds.
perfect fit.
perfect gift
bought these for my grandchildren and they just love them.
the price are expensive fir this headphones.
but quality are not good we can get better headphones from $5.  
price not worth.
"very excellent, it may been my phone but the controls sometimes have to be unplugged n plug it back in.  "
other than that they are amazing
buenisimo
one side doesn’t work
"had pair for several years, so i replaced them when they quit working."
quality isn't any better and these didn't even come with a case.
my son loves them.
sound quality great.
fast shipping
the earphones was not working good after just few months of purchase.
"great earphones, you can pause/play music and answer calls, but the volume controls don't work with the samsung galaxy s8."
the part that plugs into the phone snapped off on second day of use.
waste of money
"i liked everything about it, so i have bought 2 of them"
these are great for an iphone and ipad
these headphones sound terribledo not waste your moneyi’ve purchased better from the dollar store/drug stores
just got them and now they don’t work anymore
tried on multiple phones.(there probably fake)
these are excellent for convenience for the iphone 8.  
"great sounds, and reasonable price."
purchased as xmas gift.
two full months lasted and still enjoying.
would recommend.
love them-
not at all like my last pair.
"these are cheaply made, not happy at all."
in love
only thing i can’t talk to anyone with them
i don’t hear ntn
"cool color , sleek designs and great sound"
even with the smallest ear buds they still slide out of my ears.
i love them
best sound i've found for the money
"it does not stay in the ear, i ordered ear hooks"
a well made earphones.
beats does it for me
brand new but left earbud came slightly blown.
and just horrible sound.
do not buy
i’ve had these only for 5 days and one of the earbuds already went out.
don’t waste your money
these things are worth so much more than they cost!!!  
"the best sound quality ever, and they will last."
worked extremely well cancels out all background noise best headphone
i’ve ever purchased
ordered the black beats with lightening connector.
got the red ones with the wrong connector...
don’t stay in place
match the iphone xr
so well!!overall
great ear
buds!shipped fast
"great product, excellent quality!"

will be returning asap.
"love these headphones , very loud and clear sound."
thay are amazing
pretty good.
volume controls don't work on android though
great product
it lasted 2 months and the earphones stopped working.
"quality sound  for real, for real....."
it has great sound and looks good too
it has great sound and looks good too
wow am i not impressed.
i bought these mostly because of the brand
and i regret spending so much green.
however it is apparently apple approved because it works with my iphone 7 plus.
it seems not to get too much outside noise-noise canceling?
it fits into my ears nicely since the earpiece is flexible.
however seriously people?
it works and therefore i give it a four.
i did buy these at a sale and they are still outrageous.
i think i should have opted to stay with my original apple buds for the price.
excellent ear buds
sounds distorted and fuzzy would not buy again.
these are my daily drivers and they work great
good
you get exactly what u pay for.
"love love love, best earphones"
i’ve ever had
100
x better than apple earbuds.
recommended
absolutely love these earbuds
broke within the first week.
i think this earphone is great.
worth it!
did amazing would recommend
my daughter loves them
awesome
perfect exactly what i expected.
not worth ur money
ear tips are amazing addition
these sound amazing.
quality is top notch and loving the color!
quality is extremely low!
great headphones
very good
loved it
i like how they sound
🤦🏻‍
♂️
awesome
great
good sound quality
good
great head phones
mic doesn't work
they sound very very good
i enjoy
looks great and sounds amazing.....
when it works!
while using the earphones i often get reverberating echoes and repeating during itunes playback on my iphone 7.
i attempted to contact expert support through amazon customer service site and
when i enter my number for a callback it doesn’t even go through.
fyi amazon
you service isn’t so great anymore!!!
great product
great sound!
i work outside and they are awesome for noise cancellation.
love it!
they praise me a lot because the bass is high and also the sounds are clear
awesome
trash
nice
👍
they were more than i expected
great quality a lot of bass
"you can’t go wrong for the price, i would actually pay $100 for these headphones great packaging comes with extra ear buds"
we bought these in march 2018 and it is now june
and they have already broke.
there is a short in the wire or something it cuts out and is static.
i got these headphones for my birthday.
i loved the way they sounded.
"but after about a month, the audio jack started to bend."
"after about 2 months, they stopped working completely and the audio jack was destroyed."
"now let me clarify that i have always taken care of my headphones, especially ones as expensive as these."
"however, the durability for these is enough to never make me buy from beats by dre ever again."
"i'm sure many of you will disagree, but i'm just sharing my short-lived experience with these."
they came really fast (2 days) and came in original packaging and they work really well.
the audio quality is incredible!
definitely worth the money!!
the color is really pretty
it's awesome
"with all the talk about how good the sound quality is on beats, i thought i would give it a shot."
i honestly was not all that impressed.
i can get a better more robust sound from the standard issue headphones from apple.
i also found that these headphones are not as comfortable as my apple headphones.
i usually have to take the beats off after about 30-45 mins of use as they get a bit uncomfortable in my ear even as i change the various extra size ear pieces in which beats provides.  
not worth the money imho
"everything came packaged right, but my standered apple headphones sound better."
not impressed.
earbuds came in perfect condition and sound great.
i like it.
but it doesn’t sound as good as iphone headphones
", it was definitely not worth $60."
they sound great
but i prefer iphone headphones.
good bass
"compared to the apple headphones that come with iphones, i didn't hear a difference in sound quality at all."
"also, the wires are slightly too heavy and clumsy -- they kept pulling the earbud out my ears."
i couldn't get a full run or workout in without having to constantly push the earbuds back into my ears.
just not worth the 100 i paid.
"sadly, i'll be returning them and sticking with apple's headphones."
for anyone that is looking for audio quality: please put your money on other headphones.
i compared this earphone with the one apple included in the box
", i have to say, this one does not worth $100 at all."
the highs and mediums are totally trash and
"the beat is decent, but i expected more from it."
fatal flaw-
"be aware!!although not shown on any picture on amazon, these come with optional"
"""wingtips""- think the same silicone shapes that bose invented.  "
i put a wingtip on one earbud then decided i preferred them without the wingtips.  
opps- you put it on and ain't no way it's coming back off.  
really?  
a ridiculous flaw.  
so back they go.  
(bought the bose soundsports instead and am very happy with them.  
and no i don't work for bose.
everything about this product is fine except for the most important - the sound.  
"the choice of tips allows for a good fit, the buds stay in the ear even when walking/exercising, and the product is lightweight.  "
"unfortunately, the sound is horrible.  "
"it's tinny and scratchy,  as if someone maxed out the treble."
the sound has no depth whatsoever.
there's absolutely no base at all coming through.  
it literally gave me a headache after just a few minutes.  
do not buy them.
i used them with an iphone x and they are a 100 times inferior to the apple earphones that are included with the phone.
earphones are too loose and fall out of ears
"the only downfall it plugs into the charging port, but great sound."
there amazing i love them
i am going out of my way to write this review today.  
i bought these a few months ago from another retailer and after trying them out put them back in the bag to return.  
twice now i've taken them back out to listen again.  
i paid close to $50 for them over the counter
so i had to be missing something....
each subsequent listen validates my belief that these are actually worse than the $10 disposable earbuds you can get at a local dollar store.
"i have smallish ear canals, and every other earbud (even the $10 cheapies) usually fits well with the medium size silicon bud.  "
"neither the small, medium nor large fit me on the urbeats3.  "
"the small was way to small, the medium a bit too small, and the large was too big."
"using the medium, pushed further in and held in place for an air-tight fit - these earbuds sound like trash.  "
"there is literally zero bass for starters, and the quality is nothing short of tinny."
unfortunately i didn't return them in time
so they are gonna wind up in the garbage.  
i won't even keep these as an emergency spare they are so horrible.
if your using these for the first time and they happen to sound like
dollar store earbuds make sure your using the correct size earbud for you personally.
"secondly, give the earbud a little twist to fit snug in your ear."
"besides that these are great for the gym, flights and everything else."
bought a pair because these were marked down to $38 at a competitor.  
i had lost my klipsch wired earbuds which i loved.  
these things sound like absolute garbage.  
the bass is good but everything else sounds tinny and cheap.  
i have $5 cheapo earbuds which sound just as good.  
if you turn up the volume a bit the sound just gets distorted.
"for $10, these might be a good purchase"
but i would look elsewhere if your'e going to spend $59 on a set of earbuds.
all the positive reviewers need to listen to a pair of good earbuds and see what they are missing.
even if they were $9.99 they’d be 3 stars.
"they are way over priced and you’re  paying for the name, in which this case doesn’t hold up to their reputation of offering quality products."
"the most annoying thing is that when the cord rubs up against you, you can hear the vibrations in your ear."
this would be the perfect headset for a manikin.  
can you imagine what it sounds like when you’re running?  
it sounds like beats fired everyone in the quality control department and then stuck a premium price tag on it.
no more beats for this guy.
"there is almost no bass, the sound is the opposite of ""full"" and the product is overpriced.  "
"two other complaints - no case, and the individual ear pieces are not marked for right and left, which is a pain."
(i got these earbuds for the lightning connector of my new iphone.  
"given the beats brand name, i had no questions about the product quality when ordering.  "
that was a bad assumption.  
i have used airline earbuds that sound better than these.  
"i went back to my old sony earbuds, and bought a 3.5mm to lighting connector . . .  )"
i was skeptical when i saw people had negative reviews about all treble and no bass in these.  
i sit at a desk all day
"so i wasn't worried about them falling out while running, but as soon as i put them in all i heard was treble.  "
"however, after a slight adjustment to the sound on my spotify, and once i put the larger rubber pieces on the earbuds, the sound is so great.  "
"if you don't have the earbuds in and sealed properly, then yeah, you will only hear the treble and the sound sucks.  "
all you need to do is put the right rubber pieces on
so it's sealed in your ear and they work great.  
now i don't have to worry about static with every slight movement from my 3.5mm jack with the lightning adapter.  
very happy with these
and i have been looking for a while!
i helped my boss in selecting these headphones.
i personally have owned 2 pairs of beats in ear headphones that had average to good quality sound for the price.
my boss received his headphones and could not use them after all.
he wears hearing aids and wanted them to have quality phone conversations and listen to audio books.
it was too difficult for him to remove his hearing aids to answer phone calls
so he asked me if i could use them.
i had just purchased the iphone 11 and needed headphones with the lightening adapter
so i was excited at his offer.
i plugged them into my phone to listen to some music and thought that something must be wrong with my phone because they sounded so tinny.
"i grabbed the headphones that came with my phone and tried those and the sound was great, i just don’t like the way they just sit in your ear."
so my review is don’t waste your money on these.
not sure what the difference is between the beats i have purchased in the past and these but
the quality is not there.
just terrible.
the quality is amazing.
the buds are magnetic and stick together and the cord never tangles.
"i did have an issue with the volume rocker breaking, but apple replaced them for free."
"if you're looking for an alternative to apple's garbage earpods and you don't want to feed into the wireless craze, these are great."
i've had them for over a year and they're holding up well after daily use.
it's just so handy to have the lightning connection and not mess around with a dongle adapter.
"i use them at the gym, for music, podcasts, phone calls."
"bass is good, the microphone works really well."
i sometimes have calls while riding my bike and the person i'm talking to can't hear wind noise.
super happy with this product.

super happy with this product.
i had an old pair and they worked fine but needed a pair with lightning connector.
these are basically awful.
"theyre not as comfortable, the sound seems tinny and the cables between the ear buds and where it merges with the connector are so short (and the cables are so thick)"
they pull out of your ears every time you move your head.
brutal - basically a waste of money.
i was so excited to finally get a pair of beats headphones.
"i unpacked them, found the correct earplug to fit for myself and then turned on my music."
😩😩 the sound quality was extremely disappointing.
i listen to a lot of blues and the songs lost all of their depth.
it sounded ‘tinny’ and the over exaggerating of the bass made the songs sound off and uneven.
these are going back for sure.
"the earbuds that came with my phone are a lot better, and less expensive"
the sound on these is great.
no problem there.*they don’t stay in my ears -
i’m constantly having to push them back in while at the gym.
got 3 alternate size rubber pieces in original packaging
- none of them help.*they are so susceptible to picking up noise.
"when i run, the chord bounces against my body and makes a loud thumping noise in my ear."
"when they work, these work well."
"however, i have to constantly unplug and replug the jack into the lightning port."
i've cleaned the lighting port and the disconnection does not seems to be related to any wiggle or poor fit.
it's something in the headphones themselves that require constant resetting.

i was happy to receive these as a gift but after only 3 months they started making a high pitched whine.
a few days later the left earbud stopped playing sound at all.
don't waste your money on these poorly made pieces of junk.
"at least while they worked, they had slightly better sound quality than the $5 grocery store ones i typically buy."
i have $5 headphones that sound better.
just terrible quality.
i took them to the apple store and was told there was nothing wrong with them.
"in other words, they're really just terrible to begin with."
the bass on this product is both muddled and undefined.
you can hear low end
but it sounds like a low extension.
there is no bass definition like hearing the bass guitar.
sound quality is similar to dollar store buds.  
i dont think the positive reviewers have ever heard good ear buds.  
i like thw flat cable and that the buds stick together for storage.  
these would be average earbuds if priced at $20.
bought these from apple store for $120 cdn.
bad design (lack of appropriate strain relief at plug) resulted in failure after 3 or 4 months of use.
"neither apple nor the manufacturer would honor the 12 month warranty (as the problem had a physical cause, namely the early failure of cord).not impressed!"
these sound like complete sh*t.
do not buy these.
i am very disappointed.
the regular plastic apple earbuds are a million times better than these could ever be.
sound really good
and i had accidentally put them through the washing machine.
"guess what, i’m using them rn"
"expected sound quality, but somewhat poor figment even after changing the ear bud pieces to different sizes."
they constantly fall out
"when during basketball, while running or on cardio equipment."
i’m still convinced that $15 skull candy earbuds are the way to go.
"these are exactly what i wanted for travel, they sound perfect and fit in my ears nicely."
i have not heard a better sounding headphone to date.
the microphonics (annoying rustling sound you sometimes get with earbuds with silicon ear pieces) are terrible on these.
you can wrap over ear and/or use a shirtclip to help
but they are still bad.
"save you money and either go wireless, over the ear, or cheaper ear bud"
"that isn't ""noise cancelling"" style."
my 11 year old gift 🎁 he loves it
"great job, i advise any rap/hip-hop fanatic to purchase these especially on the road."
"bass is good especially for earbuds, sound quality is clear, and for sure high quality earphones."
but i wouldn’t pay more than 60
"$, they’re good but not good enough for it’s retail price."
🤷

♂️
"i would have expected that beats would produce a better product, designed to last more than a few months...….only used for casual listening, no exercise, and one earbud already does not work.  "
not built to last
"these have been great, no issues until recently as now the volume/playback controls don’t work."
considering these are made by apple
i’m not surprised since they were probably designed to break.
outside of the ear bud covers fell out within five months.
once that happened different pieces start breaking.
cheaply made wouldn't buy again.
comes with nothing official beats comes with i got some from best buy
a while ago come with extra ear clips and carrying case this come with just headphones plus unboxing videos show that it should have it
i call fake
"the headphones that came with my new iphone 8 plus had some kind of weird feedback, and i wanted one piece of equipment, rather than worrying about losing the small lightening port to headphone adaptor.  "
"there are great, and the varies sizes of the inserts helped me find the right fit.  "
no complaints.  
"when the price drops again, i'll buy more!"
had one set replaced under warranty for mic not working then the right side went out with no audio on the replacement.
the warranty does not renew.
never buying beats again.
not good at all.
for the price not worth it.
if they were $9.99 then
ok.
returning them.
save your money
started malfunctioning a month after i got them
"these broke in a weeks, they are not good quality."
me llegaron en perfecto estado
ᗷeᗩtᔕ iᔕ ᗷeᗩtᔕ
really like the extra ear pieces
no decía la descripción exacta
good
amazing!
"it does not work well whit android, and the package is basic."
the comfort is not good for your ears.
perfect.
the box it came in and all the extra pieces it came with were great.
definitely worth the money.
i used them when on the bus
and it blocked the outside noise pretty well.
"these sound amazing, but honestly i bought them for the colour."
i love these!
i use them a lot
nice
great quality & sound.
love them
needed new headphones
and i always need the ones that have a strap and go over the ear.  
"for working out, they're great..."
they don't fall out and
no worries i'll leave them somewhere.  
when not using they just stay wrapped around my neck.  
they tend to have a pretty good range connection and fast/seamless connection to my iphone.  
battery life is about average.  
"the only thing i'd want to change is the ""battery low"" warning come on before it's almost dead."
would be better if it popped up at around 50% power
left
so i can remember to plug them back in before i totally run out of gas.  
"they are noise cancelling but not as ""silent"" as some others i've tried.  "
"but it's probably better off that they're not ""that"" noise cancelling"
so you can hear things going on around you.  
overall they're a great value and would buy again!
for years i have used one brand only but the model i like was out
so i tried these.  
"nice sound to me, comfortable.  "
my expectations may not be that of young people.
these also play louder which is good for my elderly ears.
this is the second pair.
use them all the time everyday.
i will buy them again when i need them
i bought an active headphone about two months ago from amazon.
it works great.
this one is for my dad.
he likes it so much.
"i don't need a fancy one, but one with all the basic function is fine."
the most important is that this is very affortable.
you can't complaint anything with this price.
and it works so great!
pros:
these sound really good.
"whether i'm using for calls or to listen to podcasts or music, the quality is sharp and clear.  "
the on/off button placement is great and doesn't take a lot of pressure.
the volume button is slightly less easy to deal with.
cons: they are a little uncomfortable.
the earpieces fit well enough
"but if i wear the neckband in back, it gets caught on my clothes and pulls."
i am constantly adjusting the band.
i find it is almost better to wear the band in front
but that looks horrible if you are using this outside of the gym.  
"if you want to keep one earbud out (so you can hear the kids or listen for the door), it's hard to deal with the hanging bud."
i try tucking it into my shirt.
battery life is good if using only for the gym.
i use mine around the house while i'm cleaning or working at the computer and the battery life is just okay.
"i have to charge these after about 7 or 8 hours, depending."
another pair i had would last double that time or more.
this is not a big deal because these charge up  fairly quickly.
"overall, i am just going to deal with the negatives because the sound quality trumps any cons."
i don't get the usual complaints about sound when i am talking to people.
i so far have enjoyed having these headphones.
"they're good for workouts, they're comfortable to wear, and the sound is good for what they are."
my only gripe is that they use the old sbc bluetooth codec instead of the more modern aac or aptx codecs (which sound a lot more clear and distort the audio a lot less than sbc).
"the drivers are surprisingly bassy, and although the bass is a bit overrepresented, the sound is only slightly muddy."
"i feel like the good hardware in these is let down by the lack of aac/aptx, though."
all of the artifacts sbc adds to the audio (that sound like digital static more than any part of the speaker being overdriven) take away a lot of the life in your music.
"like older bluetooth speakers and headphones, these begin to show distortion in any track that is complex in treble (such as half·alive's ""runaway"")."
"the audio is good until there are a lot of high-end elements, and then the quality falls apart until the intricate parts of the track are over."
"if you aren't a snob about audio and need some workout headphones, i recommend these as a good, affordable option."
what a gift to give to my sister.
"she sometimes trains dogs and will be going to college soon, what a better going off to college gift than these earbud."
"now, thankfully she does not wear glasses, then the hooks that go around the ears would be a little bit of trouble, but she doesn't, so it doesn't matter."
hopefully i will be able to update this later with her thoughts on them (when i talk to her next!).update:
"sister says that the ear loops are not terrible, but they are not the best either, hard to use if wearing other things on head as well."
"i have only had these for a few days, but so far they are amazing for the price.  "
sound quality is much better than i expected.  
you just need to be sure to adjust them
so the buds sit in the ears properly.  
that really does make the difference.  
the are comfortable to wear.  
wore them on a run in the rain and they didnt slip out of place at all.  
the only negative would be the bluetooth range is only about 25 feet.  
so if you wear them in the house and try to go to another room it will get choppy.  
but that is a pretty minor detail.
"right, so i don't typically write reviews for many products, it just slips my mind a lot of the time."
"that being said, i feel obligated to write this because of how good of an impression these earbuds have left on me."
"for the price they cost, they're excellent."
"i use them daily at work in the middle of the bay, surrounded by water and dirty muddy gunk, and they have yet to show any signs of wear or tear."
"the battery life is pretty good, considering it lasts a complete shift at work for me, and has enough charge to stay alive through a session at the gym afterwards."
"sure, the sound quality isn't the //best//, but you shouldn't be expecting the absolute best sound from something in this price range."
"regardless though, if you're looking for something with good value, this is what you should get."
for 13$
(
"or whatever it was i paid for them ), you can't go wrong with these."
these headphones are so wonderful that i ordered another pair for my hubby for father’s day and then ordered two more pairs to stick away for my kids!
they are fantastic at noise cancelling (so much that sometimes i just use one side).
i almost wish they would adjust a little quieter.
"i’ve used them in the bath, while exercising and while doing housework."
fantastic deal!
for the price these are some nice headphones.
"i use them in the office, haven't used the during a workout yet."
"they are comfy, i wear glasses and they still fit well over my ears."
good sound quality.
"synced with my phone quickly, fully charged in a few minutes."
trippy...
"i walked away from phone, when i came back in range"
i got a message that i was reconnected.
this is a perfect replacement for powerbeats 3.
audio quality is truely great.
i liked the ergo design which fits into ears and doesnt come off.
best fit during workouts.
nice battery life.
gets charged real quick.5 out of 5 for this product.
do consider this before going to powerbeats.
this is definitely worth for the money you pay.
only flaw with these is the cord between the two earbuds.  
i seem to have untwisted it
but it seems to still twist and is stiff enough that the twisting cord will lift these off my ears.  
it's like a wonky phone cord if anyone remembers phones with cords...
otherwise this item is perfect.
"strong connection, great sound, fit well on ears"
had these for a month now and havent had any problems.
"use these mostly at the gym and havent experienced problems with sweat or moisture so far and they tend to stay pretty firmly in place, even when i'm running on a treadmill.  "
connects well via bluetooth with my phone and laptop at the same time which is nice.
only issue is that the volume doesnt go down all the way
"(but i also prefer my music to be more in the ""background"" normally, not blasting loudly)"
my husband loves these.
i wish i could explain the amount of headphones he goes through.
"however, these i have yet to get a “babe where are my headphones?!” (in this house, that’s a miracle)"
but it’s because he’s literally always wearing them.
"for this price, you can’t beat it."
he’s a personal trainer and has his own finance business
so he’s either on the phone or in the gym
and these are so great for him on the go.
"he’s had problems before with ear pieces not staying in the ear correctly and these come with different sizes, so it’s perfect to mix and match if you need.  "
"i have a matching set for myself, too, and love them."
put the unit on connected great sounded great
but.... after an hour of wearing it a sore spot developed in the ear from the rectangle base of the unit putting pressure where the earbud connects with that base.
i used to wear my old head set for hours and hours no problem.
this one from just using it for about 1.5 hours to finish up a book on audio
my ear is still hurting this morning.
the fit was terrible and the over-war pieces aren’t adjustable.
"if you don’t have exactly the right size ears, these will be uncomfortable and fall out all the time."
i can’t use these for running because they continually fall out of my ears.
"i'd never heard of this company before, but took a chance based on the reviews."
"i'm so happy i did, the fit, the sound, the overall appearance, just what i was looking for."
"i couldn't have asked for anything more, very happy."
very comfortable headphones.
nice headset.
comfortable to wear.
paired up nicely with my phone.
i'm not good with technology
and i figured it out.
very happy with my purchase.
great product.
i use them on my bicycle rides and working out.
good volume and noise cancellation.
the sound is nice; you will like it.
i was gifted a pair of these headphones and loved them at first.
"after about 4 months, the bluetooth stopped working."
"because i liked them, i bought another pair."
the second pair worked great for about a week.
"after that, the bluetooth stopped working and now they are useless."
i would suggest spending a little more money and getting a better quality pair of headphones.
sound quality is average at best.
the fit of the actual ear part is awkward and hurts after 10 minutes of use.
"however, the biggest thing is that the battery life does not go for the advertised ""up to 8 hours."""
"at full charge, i would listen to a few songs and within 40 minutes the system starts warning me of low battery."
"at best, i got about an hour each charge."
it got ridiculous that i would charge the set for an hour to use for an hour.
other reviews stated that the battery life was okay
but i must have gotten an extremely defective unit.
i got these to leave at work because i was always leaving mine at home.
right out of the box they were charged and quickly paired with my iphone.
"the sound quality is great, i'm really impressed with these for the price."
i bought this headphone because a friend of mine uses the same one and he recommended me to try it because i like to listen to music while noises around me are canceled and focusing on the music.
and this headphone does just that.
"also the sound quality is remarkable, if you are lookin to get a bluetooth headphones look no further honestly!"
these headphones are easy to pair and have very nice sound for this price point.
i could wish for a bit better battery life.
uses usb micro.
very good value
these are quality for only $20 honestly.
"decent battery life, good looking,  and decent sound."
a noticeable downgrade in sound quality from my skull candy's but better than the garbage apple gives you.
the sound quality is good.
"if you're only using them while still or for commuting, it will work."
but it skips constantly when running or playing a sport.
i opened it yesterday and first thing i noticed is that the charger does not go in the slot fully.
"it is damaged on one side, therefore it wont go in the designated slot."
product looks impressive but i cannot use charger.
disappointed.
"though the price of the product is on the lower side, it offers great sound quality."
"i would recommend this to someone who's looking for a decent bluetooth earphone at a lower price, this one suits you."
it has good sound quality but would not stay in my ears and fell apart after a few months of usage.
my other wireless headphones died after 2 years and needed a similar set for running and workouts.
"if you get the proper earbuds, then these stay in the ear and are super comfortable.  "
great sound without having to blast the volume.
i couldn't believe how good these headphones sounded.
"like one reviewer mentioned """
"is the price right""."
easy installation on multiple devices - phone and tablets.
"sound quality unchanged between devices, no distortion."
ear pieces comfortable with or without glasses.
would i buy these again?
absolutely.
would i recommend to a friend?
already have.
these are surprisingly good headphones at a low cost.
love that they come with a pouch to protect them.
easy and fast to charge and to pair.
work really well.
"i purchased this item originally on may 22, 2019 that headset stopped working with no fault of  my own( did not drop in water, did not keep near any heat)."
i liked the  convenience of these so much that i purchased another set that was delivered today.
i would like some sort of credit or another bluetooth due to the fact that they just stopped working all of a sudden.
"decent sound quality, earplugs doesn’t move or fall while running or exercising."
comes will small carry case.
good product for price.
bought these to replace my power beats and these are pretty good.
"pair fast, charge fast and have a stable connection while providing good audio."
for the price these are unbeatable pretty much clones of the power beats however those have better ear clips with a stiffer rubber than the letscoms.
overall 9/10 minor improvements needed to make them perfect but for $30 they're unbeatable.
love these.
i use them probably 1 week at a time and then put them on charge
i use these daily for 1-2 hours at the gym and these are perfect.
purchased these about a week ago to use for running and have not had any problems with them.
the sound is good with reasonable bass.
these worked wonderfully out of all the bluetooth i've owned and tried the voice is clear loud enough to hear even in noisy situations
i just got these yesterday and they seem to be what i was looking for at an affordable price.  
i can't rate the battery life as they are new
but i am happy with the sound quality so far.  
"also, while i was using them watching youtube vids, my wife couldn't hear any sound coming from me, which is not the normal situation.  "
"finally, they seem to be very comfortable so looks like a winner!"
"battery life good, clarity of music outstanding."
i use these when i cut my lawn.
whistle while u work.
took about 15 seconds to pair with phone.  
very light and easy to connect to ear.
not bad for the price..will check back later for durability and performance.
☆☆☆
bought in august of 2019 and no longer work.
i tried contacting the company however no response.
they are great headphones but they didnt last.
if the company's see's this review please contact me please.
the ear plugs fit my ears comfortably.
the sounds / bass are crystal clear.
i feel like i’m at a live concert when using it.
the round holder has a zipper very convenient.
highly recommended.
i gave them away because they weren’t as comfortable as my other head phones.
the charging cord and charging port melted together while charging.
the headphones only lasted a few weeks.
do not buy!
works and sounds really good surprisingly.
sound just like and just as good as beats
"good for working out at the gym, or running, good deal for the price i paid"
sound quality is respectable but with basically no bass / low end.
i bought them for jogging.
"the bluetooth controls work well, and they stay put well enough."
for the price they're tough to beat.
these are amazing!
comfortable and stay on while you move about.
connection is horribly unless you hold it very close to the headphones and dont move.
using these at the gym with my phone is the pocket sounded horrible and scrambles almost every second.
i tried it on 2 different iphones and same result.
"these are excellent headphones, especially for the price."
"the battery life is amazing, they are comfortable and easy to use."
my only con is the bass.
i've seen some reviews say it was too much bass
but i highly disagree.
there is hardly any bass unless i max it out on my eq settings.
overall though they are great and i would buy them again
great product with good sound and ease of use.
these wireless bluetooth headphones are an excellent value.
they work well both during casual listening as well as during physical activity.
phone call quality is superb.
battery life is good.
included carrying case protects the headphones well when not in use.
i would highly recommend these headphones for purchase.
these are good for the gym and worth the money.
i usually wear my headphones as loud as they can go and with these i don't need to.
it feels nice in my ears and sounds great!
easy to use and a great product.
sound is excellent
easy to use and a great product.
sound is excellent
not to bad for the money
it great for listening to an audio book as you hike
awesome product
very clear & loud!
"was a little nervous because of price,but love them,bought another pair for my dad,quick easy set up on my iphone"
i ordered in mid june 2019.
as of mid august they have quit working.
they will not turn on even though the indicator light says they are fully charged.
you get what you pay for
i've lost my headset about three times.
this is my fourth pair (i'm irresponsible)
and i keep coming back to these.
"for the price, they're actually perfect."
i use mine for workouts and they're perfect for that!
highly recommend these earbuds!
satisfied
great price for a great product.
very comfortable and really has a great sound.
noise cancelling works great!
la batería no dura demasiado pero
la calidad precio es muy buena
great product.
great value.
these are some great headphones for the gym or being active in some other activity.  
my only issue is where to put one if i can only keep one in my ear.
inexpensive pair of quality headphones!
the sound quality is great and i could instantly notice he noice cancellation feature.
"they sound great for the price, easy to use, easy to pair and all that."
would recommend to anybody tbh.
these earbuds are amazing!
better than what i expected.  
i love them so much
i ordered 2 more for my coworkers who is in their 60's!!
i highly recommend these.
i love the case and accessories too!
i worked out with these earphones this past week and loved them!
the sound quality and noise cancellation are fantastic.
i highly recommend them!
just got these in the mail today.
so far so good.
the fit is great and the bluetooth connection is fast..
my only issue is the sound.
it's too bass heavy with weak treble and mids.
sorta lacks a good dynamic range
but for the price they're cool.
"i haven't used these yet, but i do like the fit"
and i like the style.
i'm sure i'll be very pleased with them
these headphones are great!i love that these headphones fit in my little ears and stay in place.
i’ve had more expensive headphones that aren’t as good as these.
the price was right...and the sound perfect.
would highly recommend.
these head phones are great.
i use them when working out and mtb.
so far they have stood the test of my abuse.
sound quality is great as well.  
come with a nice caring case and different size ear bud for you to have the perfect fit.
works good
had them for a while now.
no issues.
sounds great
compact and functional.
battery life not the best but for the price...
acceptable
the sound and battery life are superior.  
probably should have bought this in the first place.
i absolutely love these!
"they arrived very promptly, fit my ears very well, and i do have pretty small ears.  "
the sound quality is very good for the price.  
very satisfied with this product.
great set of headphones which work well with amazon fire tablet 7.
awesome product awesome price!
i would buy again!
good quality didn’t expect to have this quality for the price ill buy again
overall a decent set of bluetooth headphones for a reasonable price.
"audio quality is sufficient for average use, but if you're an audiophile you might want to pay a little more for deeper bass and higher consistency."
"i took great care of these headphones, but after two months they stopped charging even after trying a half-dozen different chargers or cables."
this was a gift for my dad for father’s day.
he loves them and uses them during his workouts.
he sweats a lot and they still work fine.
he also said they’re extremely comfortable.
"great for phone conversations, staying on ears and battery life."
not so great for the bulk of the actual earbuds nor for music.
almost zero base.
it's a shame because otherwise they are amazing.
these are low-quality junk.
the sound cuts out at least every five minutes.
"if i can find the box, i’m returning them."
i have had for a month and the right headphone does not work.
good product
absolutely love them
the battery stopped charging after a week of use.
the sound quality of the headphones allows me to stay focus on my workouts.  
the quality motives my drive to ignore all outside distractions.
they were great for the buck but not even 3 months later they just stopped charging and no longer work.
like these great battery life they stay in on my runs easy to pair and
great range
works great.  
easy to set up will be buying more later
these cordless earbuds have worked great.
"i use them running, around my apartment and when i am out and about."
the sound quality is awful...
it sounds like i am trying to listen to music on an alarm clock from 1980.
amazing!
and very helpful customer service.
pretty good for the price.
i’m pretty hard on these things too.
they are worth it.
"ok quality, for the price more than worth it."
i use these when i go to the gym.
they work very well and stay in my ear just fine.
sound quality is very good for such an inexpensive set.
these headphones are wonderful
so far so good the battery life is great.
it a good headphone for the price.  
i would buy again.
product stopped charging 35 days after my purchase.
please advise how to return
the sound quality is really good and the built-in microphone is clear.
overall good quality for the price.
"works good, no big complaints."
does it's job
everything is great about this except the plastic piece tends to bruise my ear on the right side and the audio could be louder 4/5
nothing.  
better than expected!
"i mean they work, they sound fine, but why do the beep?"
loudly.
whenever i press a “button” on my phone?
they’re wonderful!
haven’t put different buds on yet sorta hard to get on
but when you do won’t want to take off.
me gutan
i wear them inside my helmet while i ride my motocross bike and the sound quality is great.
love the headset it was well worth the price that i paid for the product.
works well
horrible.
broke within a month
liked
love the quality for the price.
great headphones
excellent product...
i loved it.
clear sound and very comfortables.
works as advertised.
superior price.
wear them every where and everyday it seems like.
product does as it says.
"battery life is great, lasts most of my work day."
they work great and easy to connect to your phone
i bought a pair for me and my husband.
one of the headphones were brokenplease replace them
mainly wear these when i work out at the gym or walking in the noisy city
works good happy to have this headphone 😀
thank you letscom 👌
it worked in the steam room.
excellent product.  
easy to use and excellent sound
haven’t had the headphones even a month and they stopped working!
"bought it a month ago, and the product seems good."
listening to music at work
i have not had any problem with them so far...
does what it says
"easy to setup, easy to turn on, easy to turn off, easy to use"
great product for working out!
"sounds great, noise block is good!"
super comfortable on my workouts
"excelente, muy bueno"
exactly what i am looking for!
good quality for little money
great product great value
to watch movies on cell phone
great and inexpensive
i like the quality of sound and feel
"gym use, daily use."
good product.
needs more battery life.
it came fast and the sound quality is good
it appears this product may have changed.  
the images shown with this items are different from what i have.  
"i have wireless earbuds, not the ones now picture, however, they are letscom earbuds"
and i can say that the quality is outstanding.  
i have friends with the expensive apple ipods that think these sound better and have better noise cancelation.  
"easy to use, fast and simple to pair, long battery life.  "
"for this price, this is a no-brainer!"
i bought my first pair of these headphones and one of the ear buds stopped working after i tried to remove wax from it.
"i did enjoy the battery life and sound quality for the price, so i decided to buy another pair to replace the malfunctioning headphones."
my new pair lasted a couple months at most and then simply turned off and wouldn't turn on.
"i had just charged them earlier in the day, so i don't think they shut down due to low battery."
i have spent $40 on two pairs of these headphones and they lasted a total of maybe 5months at that.
i would have been better off getting a more durable set of higher quality headphones.
"the list price of these headphones is cheap, but they won't last."
"the shape of the headphones is great to keep it in your ears, even when exercising."
i've ran and skated with these in and have had no problem.
the bluetooth connection is pretty strong.
"every once in awhile it might unlink or get finicky, but it is rarely."
"i'm definitely happy with my purchase, especially for the price point."
i use these all the time.
for improvement it would be nice if the volume went louder.
you can't beat these for the price.
if you are looking for decent ear buds to have while you do various activities or even talk on the phone
these are it.
"i bought these for my 16 year old grandson, who i raise.  "
he absolutely loves these!  
he had a pair from another vendor that he lost.  
i bought these
and he said they are the best he has ever had!!  
very well worth the money!!  
excellent value!!
ordered two for my sons .
"one pair worked fine, the other pair only got sound on one side"
so i get to return a pair and hope to god the next pair works.
okay sound.
"right out of the box, these headphones easily connected to my laptop (didn't even need to charge them first)."
i immediately opened spotify to test out their music playing abilities.
the first song i played was juice (by lizzo) and the bass is sooooo much better than i expected it to be!!!
"i had bought these to be a ""traveling"" (aka not-at-home) set of headphones due to their extremely affordable price point."
"i have some other wireless earbuds, but they were much pricier"
and i definitely didn't want to deal with losing one of them while out.
these are also good for any time i'm doing things that require regular music pausing (like at work) since they have the cord that can wrap around my neck.
"i charge them every time i get home from using them, but i haven't had them die on me yet when i use them while out and about."
"the noise cancelling is pretty good, which has been both good and bad for me since i'm using them while not at home."
"the only negative is that overear piece is almost too big for my ears, but any subsequent use after the first one i barely noticed it."
"got these headphone for so to go to the gym, his favorite color is red.  "
"he misplaced like 10sets every year, so no longer gift him super expensive headphones like those with the “b”.  "
but still want quality and durability.  
"he had this headphones for a little over a month, thankfully.  "
working properly and no complaints from him.
i wore them several times to see if i should get a set for myself.  
"things i like, fast charging that last long hours.  "
fast and easy to connect to phone.  
"clear and nice sound, can take calls from headphones, go back  to music automatically, comfortable to wear with my hair down (got waist long hair).  "
forget that im even wearing them.  
i can lay down to nurse my daughter while wearing them.  
hope
"he doesnt lose them but if he does :(, they wont hurt so much to replace as the other name brand headphones $$$ he lost in less than a week."
"first off, what more can i say?"
price: $19.95 at the time i post this review.
"once you get the right fit with the included various sized ear tips, i don't think you will be disappointed with this purchase."
"after using these for a couple of weeks and breaking them in, i found the sound to be amazing for $20 bluetooth earbuds."
"i will add that being someone who wears glasses, i've had no discomfort wearing them for long sessions."
the ear hooks were very comfortable and didn't cause any issues with my glasses.
they paired quickly with my galaxy phone/tablet/computer.
"i never watch movies or listen to music at very high volumes, but i can say i have hit well over 9hrs at around med to med-high volume before needing a charge."
but i'm sure that will vary depending on volume levels.
"receiving phone calls were quite clear, but i was told that i had a slight tin can sound to my voice, but they had no issues hearing me at normal speaking volume."
i would highly recommend them for $20.00
the quality of the headphone is terrific.
it fits around the ear very easily.
it has ear hooks which is very helpful to provide stability.
because of this it's very good choice for running and workout.
in florida we get a lot of rain.
it's waterproof design is perfect fit for that.
the bass and stereo sound quality is absolutely amazing.
i was quite surprised to see how much power this small earphones pack.
the call quality is awesome as it has excellent noise cancelling features.
the battery life is very good.
i'm getting around 4-5 days of normal use after a full charge.
it comes with a beautiful case which is really good for travelling.
i got these in and tried them out immediately.  
i love them.  
sound quality is great but it seems to be low for when i'm on a phone call
but it's definitely better than some bluetooth headsets i've owned in the past.  
i bought them to go skating in since i usually skate alone
however i ended up getting a concussion
so i'm going to have to wait a month or 2 before i can use them with any strenuous activity.  
battery life is well.  
i'm using them to listen to music while i sit in bed and relax.
this is my second pair of these earbuds.
"the first lasted 3 months, then refused to accept a charge."
"this pair lasted less than 2 months, and now refuses to accept a charge."
"i don't know what's going wrong inside, but it's happened to me twice, so be warned -"
"these are inexpensive until you find out they'll only last 40 or 50 uses, then they'll die and can't be repaired."
i like the fact that it's somewhat cordless.
or least the cord doesn't get in the way of physical activities.
"the bass in the headphones are great, but it does need more of a surround sound."
it needs sound more clear while maintaining the bass.
"also, the ear hook could be a little bit more snug."
i kinda have big ears yet these headphones don't grip the top of my ears the way it should.
pressing the button successfully responds to phone calls and the volume buttons work in controlling the volume.
"pairing with my phone was easy, but pairing for two devices at the same was a little tricky"
but i just had to restart the earphones and reopen the bluetooth menu of the other device.
it's a good pair of bluetooth earbuds.
very few of these headphones stay on me when i’m working out.
"i had previously purchased some from hopday, which are identical to these."
apparently the hopday are no longer sold.
"they are a bit bulky, but do not fall out of my ears, which is most important to me."
the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the bulkiness & the fact that the exact same headset was cheaper under the other name.
these are great for the price they hold a charge
all day i work 10 hr shifts
so its important
they last all day the sound is crisp and clear much better than the ones that came with the phone.
nobody complained about not being able to hear me when i'm using them if they break
i'll replace with the same thing.
in the last several years i have tried many different sets of never been as happy i am with the sets.
"the quality of sound is outstanding for phone calls or music in the car or outside, and the headset sits in the ears securely."
it comes with a nice case to keep the charging wire spare sponges.
"with versatile colors and excellent price, i purchased several sets to surprise the loved ones."
"after 1 week of use, this is the first bluetooth headset i have used.  "
"good value for the device, but kind of disappointed by (1) the short distance at which the blue tooth cuts out,"
"(2) how quick the battery loses its charge, and (3) discomfort in my ear from use after working out.  "
overall the wireless headphones are convenient and
i assume will just take some adjustment on my end.
if you prefer the ear hook style of wireless earbuds this pair of wireless earbuds does it all.
very comfortable and doesn’t fall off your ear like traditional earbuds.
these work great as running earbuds and would definitely recommend.
i love these headphones.
they sound great and stay in place during my workout.
"with other bluetooth units, i've periodically had to ""forget"" and repair."
these guys connect quickly every time.
"at 16 bucks, you cant beat them"
"i just tried these headphones with my smartphone, and they sound great."
very comfortable to wear.
"the controls on the headphones are very convenient to find, and they pair easy."
overall a good set of headphones for the price.
bought these headphones for my son who wears them at all times except when sleeping.
they have been very durable and sound quality hasn't changed since first purchased.
he used them so much the cord wore out
and we ordered another one online
and he is back in business.
you don't have to use the cord that comes with these
but he prefers it.
best sound i have heard on a wireless headphones so far.
very comfortable while moving your head.
look professional with label on it
just wow wow
"great for work out, running and other activities."
product won't pair with phone on several attemps.  
phone sees it and they won't pair.  
no problems with other devices.
will have to return.
"these are perfect to keep in my gym bag, they fit well, don’t irritate my ears and stay put while exercising."
a great price and the sound quality is really good
my husband took my earbuds and now i need another pair!  
he says they are great!  
they stay in his ears well and sound great.  
will definitely place another order!
easy to use and they actually fit in my ears!
"they come with different size ear buds, an instruction manual, a charger, and a case."
definitely a good value.
"i've had to charge this after each 1 or 2-hour uses as as soon as turned back on i get the ""battery low"" annoying signal."
"maybe my product was defective but based on my experience with it, it is a poor quality headset and by far my worst purchase on amazon."
"it fits my ear nicely and very comfortable, the sound quality is crispy clear."
the rechargeable battery lasts long time between each change.
this is the best headset i've owned to date.
"great sound, super easy connect, and i love the battery level feature next to my bluetooth icon."
i used these to run a 10k today and they stayed in my ear the whole time.
charges quickly and decent sound.
the earbuds paired immediately with my ipod touch and sound great.  
function buttons are intuitive and work as expected.  
have not yet tried pairing to a second device yet.
i wear glasses
so the fit is a little awkward.
otherwise i am very pleased with them.
sound quality is very good.
bought to use with a loud motorcycle.
they help tremendously.
lightweight and comfortable to wear.
the price doesn't represent the quality.
it exceeds expectations.
nice headphones!
no issues.  
they have good sound quality.
very easy to bluetooth connect to my phone.
for 15-20 bucks you can't go wrong.
i use these exclusively for working out and they're great at drowning out everything else.
sound is great.  
just wish it was wireless
so i can use just earbud when walking in street def same brand.
great for the price
decent pair of headphones.
love the case and extra ear pieces.
love the color!
i loved the ear hooks.
the headphones didn't move when i was working out.
seems to work just fine.
will see how long they last.
good so far and love the color
very good for the price.
nice and loud
very cool set.
my son loved them.
it's a good value for the money
my fiancé was always borrowing my headphones!
he loves these!
great quality for the price.
like everything but the lowest volume is way too loud
mostly i listen to books and love the convenience.
lot of backround noice
but they are so clear and comfortable!
great buy for the price
i like them; great for the gym.
great volumen
"fits well, good sound."
light and secure when active.
sound quality is better than others that i have triedat a slightly higher price point.
great item for this price point.
"cant be beat for price, good sound,  stay put on your ears,  long battery life"
better than expectes
"great product, no complaints!"
great product for the price.
i definitely would buy these again.
the sound quality is really good.
perfect to use while on morning walks.  
works so well with my galaxy s 10e.
it stopped pairing with my devices after a day of use.
i’ve tried multiple devices and it simply does not pair anymore.
must be technical malfunction.
i recommend to anyone who likes to enjoy the high and lows of music.
"the quality is fantastic, they are so light weight."
great purchase
👍
awesome product at a great price.
"fits well, stays in place, good battery."
sound is very good.  
"clear sound, and good noise reduction."
a solid 4 stars
just stops charging after about a week or two.
don't waste your time
"loved them , bought a second set for a spare .battery life is great !"
"i really liked these headphones; however, after about 3.5 months of use, they are no longer pairing with my devices despite several attempts."
you get what you pay for.
they get the job done
but they are not the best.
i have gone through a lot of headphones.
from $200 bose (wired/wireless) to $100 beats.
but nothing beats the simple wired headphones.
i produce music and listen to a lot of music and these earbuds do the trick.
"if you're looking for simple headphones with high quality sharpness, these are the best for the price you are paying."
"the frequencies are all flat, so you get music and sound as its suppose to sound."
nothing on the low end (bass) is altered.
and you can hear bass and all on these headphones.
very crisp and punchy sound.
does not sound cheap.
"in fact, i can compare these earbuds to sennheisers earbuds which range from $75-$100... and they sound just as good almost the same...."
think about that:$10
headphones =
"$100 headphonesit comes with a nice bag to put them in and alternate ear pieces (sm, med, larg)."
the packaging is impressive.
it looks like you got expensive headphones.
overall: if you don't want to spend more than $10-12 on good headphones these are awesome.
i don't know about the longevity of them because i just got them.
but i'll update the review once i see how long they last.
now ive tried dozens of head phones.
"for the past 3 years, i reached a point in my life where i had to constantly buy a new headphone every month."
"whether its at walmart or amazon, the headphones would just loose sound or the cable would tear apart from twisting in a pocket, getting snagged on a door knob, or being used while alseep."
lately i tried to search for headphones that market themselves as durable.
"last few pairs i tried were from amazon. """
"chsmonb bass stereo earbuds headphones"" absolutely weak headphones, didnt last two weeks."
"returned it after giving it a deservinv negative review. """
"kinden durable headphones"" had similar issues."
complete waste with an awkward design.
explicitly labeled as durable.
it's trash.
"the ""anker soundbuds verve"" was even worse."
i was overwhelmed by frustration.
i thought to myself; theres nothing good out there.
"but these, these are good."
"i bought it about over a month ago and thought to myself within ten minutes of use, this might be what i've needed all this time."
"the flat cable design is brilliant, the elbow port is perfect for using a device stowed in a pocket since it redirects the cabling to avoid tension."
the earbuds are fantastic.
and the cable is remarkably durable for a flat cable and they definately do resist tge wear a rounded cable would have snap under.
it also makes it super easier to detangle.
"as i sat around using these headphones that have saved me the hassle, i came to realize a positive review was due."
im even a planning on buying extras.
today was the first time i had used my betron dc earphones.  
"like everyone else, for the money, i was very happy with the sound quality.  "
"unfortunately, i am not convinced they will last one month.  "
immediately i had to wiggle one of the cord lines because i wasn't getting sound through one ear.  
"it came back, but a second time it began to crackle.  "
"so that part is disappointing and if you wish to purchase these, i would recommend investing in the protection plan.  "
if i get a year out of any earbuds i am extremely happy.  
"the betron's come with a pouch, but i have started to always place my earphones/buds in a tupperware type small container."
i use to have brands that cost me over $100.  
neither lasted a year due to the cheap wiring.  
"betron is no different, but placing other brands in a hard case seems to allow them to last longer."
i needed a replacement set of headphones for my mp3 player.  
"i tried a number of different ones that my friends had, but most of them had something unappealing with them.  "
the exception were a set that ran $40 and a set of beltron's similar to these dc950.  
"for the price, these playback almost as well as the $40 set and better than the original set that came with the mp3 player."
the box comes with three sizes of soft silicone ear pieces.  
"they fit tight on the earphone post, so changing them out is a bit tricky; but that's good once you wear them in the gym.  "
they set in the ear comfortably and stay set while running on the treadmill.
"overall, the beltron units a good value for their price..."
"clear sound production, nice strong bass (which is missing in most earbuds in this price range), and comfortable fit."
"with so many choices in the market for earphones, it's hard to believe these earphones by betron are so reasonably priced for the top quality they provide!  "
"i have ordered betron dc950 earphones, and then i ordered more in another order - also recommending them to others.  "
"if you think you have a great pair of walk-around daily earphones and tech earphones, try these!  "
you may be convinced (as i am and others) how these become your new mainstay.  
they really are impressive.  
their packaging and accessories included are incredible for such a great price!  
"thank you, betron!"
i just needed some earphones for my computer at work.
my sony's started shorting out after 10 years.
"i gotta be honest, didn't want to invest more than $10."
these betron dc950's were well reviewed.
"let me say the positives first - they look good, feel o.k., and are solidly built."
the negatives - the sound is a'ight.
wasn't too worried about noise cancellation at this price point anyway.
but i had some skull candy's at this price point many years ago that had better sound quality.
all in all - they are a solid 3 stars for price point and durability of the ear plugs.
pros:  one of the most frustrating things about the other ear buds i've purchased is the thin wires that are used.  
"they're destined to fail, and generally, it doesn't take long.  "
these ear buds haven't failed me after 4 months of heavy use.  
bought several more pairs as backups.  
they sound good too.  
"while they're not noise cancelling, they do help to muffle background sounds.  "
another plus is the extra ear cushions they come with (nice diameters!)  
cons:  
"if the angle of the buds in your ear changes , there can be dramatic changes to sound.  "
"so if you are listening to something while sitting down or resting, great.  "
"on the other hand, if you want to listen to something while cutting your grass, to avoid having to crank up the volume too much, i use 'over the ear' type of ear protection (big & cushioned).  "
what i've found is that i typically need to make numerous adjustments to the buds &/or ear protection to get everything sounding right.  
"once i do, that's pretty much it, but getting there sometimes is a pain.  "
all in all:  highly recommended.  
the pros really outweigh the cons!
"overall for the money, i guess i am happy enough."
my experience with buds under $20 (that's all i buy!)
"is that perhaps 40% lack punchy bass, 40 % lack any presence or highs and 20% are absolutely flat and missing lows and highs."
"however, i noticed that the efficiency seems to be higher than most of the other buds i have been using."
at least a 6 db increase in volume over the skull candy and a few others.  
have not tested with equipment
but i suspect that the power band is pretty flat across the entire spectrum.
i had been buying skull candy inkd around $12 and they would last about 9 months or so before i would destroy the connector etc.
the flat rubber cable used with the betron dc950 appears to be pretty durable and preferable to the plastic leads used by most others.
for the money sonically i would give these a strong 4 plus.
"mechanically also a 4.0by the way, this was a second choice product for me."
the model i wanted to order was a betron also.
special sale at about $13.95
(amazon) ysm1000.i took a phone call and to my dismay as went to finish my order
the supply went to zero.
a day a later i check again and that same set of earbuds was around $40!  
ysm1000.
today now $13.95!i wonder how they compare?
"unfortunately, i can only budget for only about $15 a year for buds!"
"i use both headphones to listen to music during sport/activity, so the comparative review is from such perspective."
music quality:
panasonic has a decent sound - both bass and highs are clear enough.
"so far, panasonic are the best among other headphones i had in this price range."
betron is sealing completely air-tight to the ear canal and as a results had pronounced muddy bass drowning the rest of the frequency range.
"wear comfort:the air-tight fit of betron i mentioned above makes it rather uncomfortable, it is ironic that despite it betron headphones are easier to fall from the ear than panasonic."
i’ve been trying various sizes of included ear-buds yet the result is the same.
convenience for sport/activity:
"betron has tangle free cord, which does tangles less than panasonic, but the cord is heavy so when you are running the cord yanks the headphones making thumping sound."
both panasonic and betron cords have rubberized feeling and tend to catch on the clothing.
also the ear-bud pieces on betron fall off too easy when wiped and hard to put back - should be the other way around.
"on panasonic it is equally easy off and on, not ideal but better than betron."
durability:
"i had this panasonic model for quite a while (three pairs) and can tell that the cord is well made and well attached to the buds, but the diaphragm fell off after few hundred hours of use - not a big deal considering the price."
"i didn’t use betron long enough to judge its longevity, but it feels well made, slightly better than panasonic."
price:
panasonic is slightly cheaper than betron.
conclusion:
"panasonic is better than betron in almost every aspect, but still have shortcomings, so i’ll be trying other brands…"
"first i ordered the betron bs-10 earphones with extra base, which was true; however, they were not entirely noise-canceling"
"but they still deserved ""editor's choice"" as they were as-advertised on amazon."
no complaints at all.
i then ordered 2 betron dc950 earphones for myself and my wife.
they are also excellent and
"in fact, i ordered one more as a spare.  "
why?  
"although the base is not quite as evident as the bs-10, the noise canceling seems to enhance the quality range fidelity by eliminating external sound influences, and the treble frequencies seem a little better for voice frequencies."
"bottom line: both earphones are great fidelity products, and well constructed."
"i prefer the dc950 because of the flat, no tangle cord (which really is true!)"
and the 90-degree angled jack.
"both earphones fit snugly into the ears, especially if you loop the cord over the top of your ear."
"the bs-10 has about a 10-15 degree angle on the bud to perhaps enter the ear canal better, while the dc950 is conventionally straight."
both earbuds fit more or less flush and don't protrude externally = nice designs.
"it is sort of a toss-up, but for the reasons above, i chose the dc950 for my spare buds."
"either way, you will not be disappointed in the excellent construction and fidelity quality."
this item is cheaply made.  
my teenage son put them in his ears and the soft part of the bus came off and was lodged in his ear.  
an inexpensive bud for school turned into a 150.00 urgent care visit to have it removed.  
do not buy!!!!!!
it didnt come with the pause/play and skip remote on the headphones themselves.
"but, the last pair that i owned lasted me 2 whole years, so i know that they are durable."
the bass is phenomenal.
the sound quality is amazing for the price
(i'd go as far as to say it's a steal).
"but yeah, my only complaint is there is no control on the wires."
"i wanted non noise cancelling earbuds, but i guess nobody knows what those are"
so i got this instead.
i'm satisfied with the quality.
"they are well put together, have decent sound quality, and even come in good packaging with multiple different sizes of covers."
"the quality could be better, but they're earbuds."
i won't complain.
"it's pretty good if you can put them in your ears correctly, but i guess you can say that about any earbuds over 15 dollars."
the noise cancellation (which
i didn't want) was okay.
it makes everything sound like your under water.
"also if you open your mouth wide while using them, you can hear dampened brown noise."
i just thought that was kinda cool.
it's about as good as my ignorant self would know about noise cancelling earbuds.
one more important thing to note.
"due to the design of the wire, it does tangle but can be easily untangled by just grabbing it from two end and shaking and tugging at it."
that is if nothing is knotted.
this makes it a lot more convenient than earbuds with slimmer wires.
"i've tried many name brand in-ear headphones: from bose, sony, jvc, philips, nu-force and others.  "
but none sound better than these.  
the only other from the list mentioned above that comes close to be as good as the betron dc950 are th nu-force ne-600x.  
but these headphones have been discontinued.  
the betron dc950 has the most bass of any in-ear headphones i have ever listened to.  
the bass doesn't degrade or negatively affect the rich sound quality.  
these betron headphones are my new favorite in-ear headphones.
"i was excited about these earphones, they have lots of positive reviews.  "
"they arrived quickly, are well packaged, look good, come with nice accessories, and have good sound"
quality- until i move my head.  
"i purchased them to use with a ""silent guitar"".  "
"when i move my head or shift my body while playing the cord rubs against my shirt, or jacket, and the rubbing sound is quite noticeable through the headphones- definitely not what i was expecting.  "
the cord is a soft rubber and doesn't slide smoothly across anything with texture.  
"i tried using the clip that comes with the earphones, but that didn't help, i tried positioning the cord a couple of different ways- again without success.  "
"i suppose if i jacked the volume up on the guitar, or played heavy metal, i might not notice the rubbing  sound, but its definitely there with finger picking."
"so, i'm returning them, though at a cost-"
i had to pay shipping both ways.
"prior to purchasing these earphones, i had another cheap set from a discount store that stopped working soon after i bought it."
"but even while it did work, the sound quality was not the best, but i was used to it."
so i wasn't prepared for what i was about to hear when i tried these earphones.
wow!
"it's difficult to remember the sound quality i was hearing back when i had my old surround sound stereo, but to me, these earphones remind me of that stereo system again."
quite amazing!
i hope these will last me a long time.
i plan to update this review later to report how long they are lasting.
"but for the price, i don't think you can beat the sound you will get from these earphones."
title says it all really.
"the sound quality is good, especially for the price."
"they feel well constructed, come with a number of varied earbud tips; including a sound canceling foam type that i haven't quite been able to keep in my ear solidly enough to make it work to"
it's full potential
"(i have pushed them and held them into place to see how well they will block noise, which they do quite effectively.), and also a clip to help hold the wires in a way as to prevent the earbuds from falling out due to wires being pulled from varying pull stressors, such as when the mp3 player is held in ones pants pocket and gentle but constant pull created from that scenario while walking or working."
"flat sealed wires are seemingly far more resistant to tangling, though obviously not impervious to the curse."
"overall, vary satisfied."
"keep in mind, i'm not an audio fanatic; so if you aren't one as well you most likely with be very satisfied with your purchase as it's comfy, solid, inexpensive, and outputs a good clean range of sound."
"if you're a noise marine though, these may not be for you."
the betron dc950 are good quality.
a bit thicker wire with red and black on both wires which is pointless.
"if the wires were color coded to know which ear to use, it would make sense."
"i use them with an imac dt, so the cable length is important and the ""l"" shape of the connection to the computer back would give me another inch."
all earbuds are intended to be used with your phone
"but i wouldn't mind paying a little more for earbuds with another 6"" added to the cable."
these replace another pair of 2 yo earbuds that for some reason one side was at very low volume and with an imac
you can't choose mono output in system preferences.
good ear buds right now
but in two years?
time will tell.
these are not good at all.
the sound is much louder out of 1 side than the other.
"the earpieces are pretty heavy, so they are constantly falling out of my ears."
and they just do t sound good.
"not at all worth the money, do yourself a favor and skip these!"
"i have been through many earbuds, they either break, speakers blow or the quality is bad."
i was really surprised by these.
the packaging was impressive.
they seem very well made.
i listen to music with pretty heavy bass
so i was very surprised when these could handle it.
sound quality is pretty good for the price i would recommend these for people who want a quality earbud for a decent price.
i wanted to try a cheaper version of these brand earbuds before spending money on more expensive ones.
i will for sure be buying more.
updatei was very disappointed when i went to listen to music and one of the earbuds no longer works.
not sure what happened because i keep them in the case.
i really liked these headphones
but i am not sure i will be purchasing these anymore just because they up and quit for no reason.
i guess the search continues....
"the headphones arrived, quickly i might add.  "
"besides that, this is an order gone terribly wrong.  "
they are wedged in packaging
"so tightly i had to tear the headphones out of the plastic, pulling the padding that was on them off.  "
"there are a bunch of these pads, i don't know why.  "
there's no instructions.  
"i wouldn't think i'd need instructions for a cheap set of headphones, but in this case, a set of instructs would be nice.  "
"i'll try again to get those silly pads on there before i throw them away, but as of now, they are a $12 set of instant trash."
"for my rating, i was using these in combination with a yeti microphone for audio and video recording for some web shows and live twitch streams for gaming."
i wanted something that didn't cover my entire head and make my head look three times the size it was but was still able to give me great sound quality.
i toss these into the output on my yeti and use the earpieces that were adjusted for my canals.
the sound quality was great.
the noise cancellation was so-so.
i'm more or less feel like because i was able to fit them in my entire ear canal that it just stopped me from hearing more on the outside.
i would assume that if i was in a louder area i could still probably hear people in the background.
"however in my studio of my house, it wasnt an issue."
overall i would recommend and buy again
typically use earbuds on treadmill or walking ~1hour/day.  
have tried many many brands and have been extremely disappointed.  
they don't hold up.  
lasting a few days to several weeks.  
the betron dc950 still works fine going into week 19.  
impressive.
side note:  
strongly recommend using a bent 3.5mm plug.  
straight plugs put too much pressure on cell phone receiver port.  
eventually they broke solder connection on two phones.
received early.
quality packaging.
no real (active) noise cancellation going on and none expected at this price point.
"no volume control/mic/track change, etc."
"(which is just what i wanted: no doo dads, no unnecessary queries with siri, etc.>>>just a quality music listening device when you find yourself away from regular speakers)."
size selection for ear pieces
(s/m/l+ set of foams).
clip included (nice touch).
"and yes, the cords are thought out>nice and flat making them easier to keep straight and not tangle."
even a small drawstring carry pouch.  
"for the $, this is a nice set of basic buds.."
"quality is everywhere and tolerances are tight..when you put the 3.5mm end onto your apple dongle, you push firmly"
"and then there is a noticeable click-no slop or sliding around, etc."
a mention on the ear buds and sizing:
proper fit is critical for good sound-especially bass.
play around with not only how you put position
"the bud in your ear, but also the size of the ear piece fitted to the bud itself>if you don't have a good fit the bass will definitely be lacking..  "
fitting
the ear piece on/
"off the bud can be a tad challenging (those dang tight tolerances again), but worth the time to get it right-don't rush it."
recommended.
i bought a set ofbetron bs10 ear buds and they failed within a week of purchase.
the stem going into the output jack of my laptop became flimsy and finally broke...luckily not inside the laptop.
the sound of the b510 were very good
so i looked into another set of betron buds and settled on dc950....
"first and foremost for the l shaped jack, which is far and away better then a straight jack for everyday use."
the sound of the dc950 is very good and for the $ excellent!
"the fit, finish, and accessories of the dc950 or in every way a couple of cuts above the b510.  "
here is the clincher: betron will replace my originals at no cost.
bottom line....
"very good value, excellent customer service."
i dislike them after the first couple uses because it would trigger the google assistant randomly.
i was able to get it to stop erroring out the second time i used them.
this is probanly why i reveied an obvious return.
sound quality 7/10
considering they are ear buds.
product quality 5/10 for bringing up google assitant when not prompted
"(thus interrupring the music)i think its ridiculous that i paid full price for an obviously opened/returned package of ""new"" head phonesi would not recommend them  because the package was torn up when i opened the box"
and it caused repeated errors on my phone (the unwarranted google assistant).the
"only good thing is the buds fit well in mg ears, are somewhat inexpensive, and sound quality is middle of the road."
would not recommend and i would like a refund or partial refund because  of these iasuesi do not recommend buying these.
i am giving these ear phones a 3 star review....
here's why:
"although they have good sound quality, the cords are just a pain."
"for one, when i work out in the gym, these ear phones tend to get pulled out of my ears due to the nature of the cords."
just what do i mean?
"well, the cords are made of a material that has a lot of friction in it; meaning they grip onto anything, unlike iphone ear phones, etc."
"the rest of the ear phone, that is, the cord, grips onto so much (your skin/shirt, etc) so that while lifting weights, these ear phones will easily be pulled out of your ears, disrupting your jam session."
"still, they are robust and give a good sound."
i'm about to do some traveling & decided i better get a 2nd set of earbuds just in case.
i wanted to buy the jlabs j5 again
but it is no longer available.
"after looking around at the bewildering number of choices, these seemed to be similar specs & in my price range."
i use these mostly for videos & some music.
i am usually static
so i can't comment on how they would perform during very physical activities.
i use them on my phone & kindle.
the sound quality is very similar to the j5 i've been using for a couple of years which means subjectively they sound pretty good for earbuds.
"i felt the ear cushions on the dc950 are too ""stiff"" & not as comfortable as the j5's."
"the j5's cord is much lighter & thinner (though 1 did fail & was replaced under warranty) than ""bentron"" cord."
since i'm just sitting there it hasn't been a problem.
the dc950 is definitely heavier all the way round.
"i still prefer the j5's but since i can't get them any more, i think the dc950 will do a good job & for the price, i would recommend them."
"as soon as i plugged them into my ipod, the loudness was piercing, but that's my fault."
i always have the volume cranked up.
i have a nearly life-long devotion to metal and great tracks to support my love for the genre.
these headphones are no joke.
"when placed comfortably in your ear, the bass is pretty deep, treble's decent and the overall reproduction is nice."
my only 2 gripes are:1)
the little booklet / instruction manual they come with advertise
in-line volume controls and there are none.2)
they slip out of my ears here and there while i'm going about my business... and i have small ears.
i wish they were more secure in that aspect.
"it's not so bad, but those of you with larger ears might wanna beware."
"those issues aside, these are good pair of budget in-ear headphones."
"fellow headbangers, be careful."
long-term use at high volumes will cause you to be made fun by other metal fans for being too dumb to lower the volume from time to time.
"they're awesome, but blistering!"
i bought these to try something different from the panasonic earbuds i have had for a couple of years that have been awesome (and that i will buy again).
these do have pronounced bass but at the expense of losing clarity.
i don’t like how bulky and heavy
"they feel in my ears; also, the cord is kind of thick and sticks to itself which is annoying."
these will be a back-up pair for listening to podcasts.
"everything about these earbuds is vastly superior,sound quality-vocal and instrumental reproduction-surround sound-"
-each earbud is labeled l & r_do this and one can experience and what can't be described by words-.there
"is no comparison,plus amazon offers a 2  year protection package."
"on one hand you have a 5-speaker stereo surround sound with eq--treble ,midrange & bass"
and  super bass faithfully reproduced.
"as an audiophile with perfect pitch-,been looking for the perfect set of earbuds"
"-i recommend,do not look any further-for $28.99 with  a 5% discount when available-"
look no further-
this quad earbud-
is perfection  
personified-
the description provided is 100% accurate-no other brand can even come close-
"if it would be possible,i would give this fantastic-vastly  superior earbud 15-stars !!!"
-by
"all means,read the product description"
",you'd be amazed!-update"
-
i still stand by my original analysis-86% of those who bought these earbuds
are not wrong
-
all i know is that the musical colors of the music comes thru-
once you position the earbuds in your ears so that the full richness of the music comes thru !
"great sound, bass and clearness."
great buy!
summary: earbuds that perform as good as those more the twice the price.

(luciano pavoratti with zubin mehta and the london philharmonic orchestra)i use this playlist for specific genres with specific voicings and instrumentation.
"it is a wide variety of music, testing dynamic ranges, equalizer ranges, and even volume levels."
these earbuds were a very nice surprise.
great sounding with no distortion throughout the whole eq spectrum!
"even with the volume levels at 80%-85%, as far as i dared to go."
there is a better presence of the music with these compared to apple's earbuds.
"indeed, apple's earbuds sounded shallow after listening to these."
"there also is more gain with these earbuds than apple's, and when putting in apple's after listening to the linklikes, i had to turn the volume up."
the bass is really decent.
"i would not say that it is deep bass, especially compared to my high end bluetooth earbuds costing five times as much."
but you will still like it.
there is enough bass to make the music enjoyable.
"in my playlist are electric basses, upright basses, avi kaplan's deep bass voice, and deep concert bass drums as well as low tuned tympani, and of course, bass or kick drum of a drum set."
"all had a nice, decent sound to it."
"vocals were great, and i listened to a large concert choir, small a cappella group, and orchestras."
"brass, woodwinds, percussion all sounded great."
"voices, solo or in a group sounded clear."
nothing like carmen mcrae or pavoratti to enjoy in good headphones as well as great choirs.
the fit was very comfortable.
i would say that i like the fit much better than apple's.
i could shake my head around and not have these pop out.
"they felt better in the ear than apple's, resulting in longer listening time."
"i also like the black color, unlike white which can get smudged or dirtied easier."
"the packaging was slick, just as good as apple's."
it even comes with a nice storage bag with draw strings.
"i highly recommend these earbuds, totally worth their cost and more."
i've been a bose earbuds fanatic for years.
"however, recently bose has gone down in quality, so i searched for a replacement."
"after trying several other brands, i stumbled onto these linklike earbuds."
"at first, i didn't like them."
three reasons for that: 1.
"i was comparing them to airbuds in a whole other price range, 2."
"i was comparing them specifically to bose, which have typically strong bass frequencies."
3.
the rubber earsleeves that came with linklike earbuds did not adequately convey
the quality that the earbuds had to offer!i didn't know that.
"i heard weak bass, thin highs, no mids, and i thought it was an inferior product, and so i wrote a negative review."
the company quickly sent me a different pair of earsleeves.
they made all the difference!
"the sound became well rounded, nice and even throughout the frequency range, a ""mature"" soundstage allowing for good detail in the music, including substantial bass."
--not
"like bose bass (an unfair comparison),"
"but i was willing to adjust my hearing for that, and for a good quality overall sound."
please see the picture attached.
"the earbuds came with the pair on top, and then linklike sent me the ""ahastyle"" ear hooks, on bottom."
"without question, the ear fit makes all the difference in how earbuds sound."
lesson learned.
"also, everyone has told me that they can hear me clearly on phone calls."
(this is where bose started to fail miserably!)
"so, with the audio quality that these linklikes offer, along with a good micropone .... and at this price??  "
yep.
i changed the review.
"also, you have to hand it to the company, they did what was necessary,"
which was to send me those earhooks.  
so now the question is:  linklike:
why don't you include those earhooks in every shipment?  
please consider it.
"i know, it's extra cost."
might be worth it to you.
"anyway, congrats on a very good product, and amazing customer care."
reason for 3 stars ...
"the shape of these hurt my ears , they fall out constantly.  "
its annoying !
i use these during my walks.  
i dont like the shape of these ear buds ....
on a postive note the sound quality is out standing!
amazing volume .
loud sound .
cancels noise .during phone calls
people heard me perfectly

after seller read my 3 star review they sent me an email and offered to send ear hooks for these ear buds for free.
i posted photo .
these slide over the ear pieces .
now the ear buds are so comfortable and dont fall out.
great customer service
very good quality love them and fit
very well works works with android and apple
very balanced
note:
i'm not payed to say this
but i believe in sharing my thoughts so people can know what to expect.
it's true that this headphone is very comfortable so you can sleep with it and even on the side.
"they are very light in weight too, so it means they can easily come off."
sometimes when listening to a high quality audio you believe it's happening in the room.
"the voice is clear when talking by the phone, according to everyone that i have talked to, but the control bottoms are too hard; you have to use strength when pressing."
"when in high volume you can hardly hear anything around you, so it has certain level of noise cancelling."
"and if your phone or pc has some sort of 3d sound or simulated surround, these work great."
"not too much bass, but that's ok because the sound quality overall is pretty impressive."
are they worth it?
yes.
"if lost or damaged, would i buy these again?"
yes.
do i recommend?
yes
i'm a bit odd.
"i don't care for bluetooth headphones, and i don't always want the noise isolation that many headphones have."
i wanted a pair of plain-jane headphones that i could use in an office environment and still hear my coworkers.
i have finally found them.
i'm using them with a galaxy note 9 (in case anyone else out there is looking for a pair for their phone).
"the buttons for volume work, the skip track works, the play/pause button works and will trigger whatever assistant is on your phone if you hold it down."
it's exactly what i've been looking for.
"i can't verify that it works on other idevices, but these headphones work with my ipod nano that i still have."
"the play/pause, skip, read the track title on holding down the play/pause button."
"i've only had these things for 5 minutes at this point, but i have been very impressed."
these are exactly what i've been looking for.
"oh, these also come with a few little covers for the earpieces."
some rubber ones and then some rubber ones with a sort of hook to keep them in your ear during workouts.
there's also a little bag with drawstrings for the headphones.
"that was a nice, unexpected extra."
"so far as i can tell, these seem to work as you would expect with both android and ios devices."
"don't hold me to that, as all i can independently verify is the aforementioned note 9 and ipod nano."
these also sound pretty good.
"i don't consider myself an audiophile, but these sound just about as good, if not the same, as the akg ones that came with"
my note 9.very happy these exist.
it's about time some company made wired headphones that work well with android phones.
"the up and and down volume signal is broken, so that when you press up or down one time, the signal rises to its max or min."
"so when i tried to raise volume one click, it blasted my ears multiple times."
i'm hoping the sound comes back into my eardrums over the next 24 hours.
these are not good quality.
i don't understand where all of the positive reviews are coming from.
i've only had them a few months
"and i don't use them every day or for very long at a time, but one of the ear pieces already has a crack in it."
i don't even know where that would've come from.
"besides that, the sound quality is no better than some of the cheaper options."
these are actually worse because they don't cancel any noise at all.
i had the sound turned more than 3/4 of the way up at one point
and i could still hear someone talking several meters away.
"by the way, they weren't talking very loudly."
"finally, they are too big."
or maybe my ears are too small.
"i don't know, but they don't fit very comfortably."
"and even when you get them where you want them, you can't move your head too much or lay down on one side or anything because they'll fall out."
"the only good thing i can say is that it comes with a carrying case, but honestly, what good does that do?"
"i carry them that way, but they still cracked."
"for years i have only used cheap sony earbuds; partly because i am cheap, partly because i can't stand earbuds with rubber and most of the higher end ones seem to have rubber."
the pair i had fell apart after years and it was time to get some new ones.
i found these and decided to give them a try.
first thing i noticed was that listening to music felt like i was completely immersed.
when i say immersed
what i really mean is that my brain feels that it is surrounded and permeated by whatever i am listening to.
it doesn't even feel like i am hearing so much as experiencing.
the frequency range is also extremely impressive.
"based on some quick testing these respond to frequencies from 25 to 14,500 hz."
what a bargain!
update: seller
is horrible.  
i had to return because the buttons didn't work and they tried calling me about
(i never gave them my number).  
when i didn't pick up; they somehow found the number for and called *
my mother
*.  
about returned earbuds.  
seriously wtf.  
stay away.
"i bought this specifically for the buttons, i.e. volume and forward/back control.  "
i have a google pixel 3a xl with android 9 and they don't work.  
"pause and volume down do, but the volume up button activates the google assistant and the forward/backward functionality (by pressing pause 2 or 3 times) doesn't work at all"
(it just pauses
/unpauses that many times).if
"you don't care about the buttons, they fit well and have decent sound quality, and microphone is decent as well."
the sound quality is quite good.
the bass is there but not that impressive.
"don't expect same quality as like 150$ over the ear headphones you can buy, but certainly among the best earphones you can get for this price for the sound quality."
really pleasant to listen to music to.
warning:
they have way more noise-leak than like earbuds which go into your ear directly.a.k.a.
"don't blast your music max volume in public transport, i was asked to turn the music down a notch by someone sitting behind me at around 80% for this noise-leak"
"i'd normally take 1 star off, but since the headphones are actually so loud that i wouldn't go above 80% or normally even 70% volume in them, i'd say it's not an issue."
noise-cancellation
i didn't notice much difference with these vs cheap 10$ earbuds...
so i don't know...
i'll give it 3/5 for that.
maybe noise cancellation works better for some than others...
or maybe they're better at blocking out certain sounds than others.
"who knows, to me no difference like"
i said.
overall great though.
"nice clear sound, a bit more bass than normal headphones or earbuds."
"worth the price, quality is good, design is solid, nothing to complain there.ohh and packaging is excellent."
10/10 nicely packaged.
edit 2:
"after posting my review, customer service contacted me."
they sent me another pair of the same headphones and a pair of 'ear hooks' attachment.
i must say that the ear hooks helped to give a better seal and produce a more pleasing sound.
this company cares about its customers and very much believes in their product!
"sound is subjective, so i am updating my review to say that, in comparison, these earbuds do not sound like oem apple earpods, but they produce a a quality sound when fitted properly in your ears."
edit:
this company has the best customer service.
after posting my review they contacted me to help.
very impressed.
these headphones sound just okay.
they do not compare to the apple oem earpods.
the quality of the construction and the materials is quite poor.
i doubt that they will last very long.
overall way too expensive for what they are.
"update 8/28/2019 : after i received the hooks, the sound quality get improved in noticeable waythe customer service is really kind and helpful."
they care a lot to satisfy their customers.recommended product and seller.------------------------------the quality of the sound
is so basic
"no bass nor noise cancellation, the sennheiser earphones have the same quality with less price ($14.99) and more comfortable."
actually i don't recommend it because there is better earphone than this with better price.
i have always had troubles finding a set that would fit secure and comfortable and have good sound.
most of the time it was either or for me.
"these headphones fit my ears quite well and don't tend to fall out constantly; wearing them even for a long time is so comfortable, you barley notice they're in."
i use mine with the standard rubber cover (it comes with two different versions).personally
"i find the control buttons easy to use, you can feel the +/-"
or the play/pause button in the middle very well.
"phone calls are of great sound quality, loud and clear and nobody complained on the other side of background noise, even when i was walking outside."
"wind, traffic noise is cancelled out perfect."
"listening to music, ranging from classic to pink floyd or rammstein and almost everything in between is a pure pleasure."
"treble is crisp and clear; bass is nice and full, but not overpowering."
"when listening to music loud, i still don't have the volume set much higher than 75/80%, leaving enough, if you really need it."
"overall i think you can't find a much better set of in-ear headphones, especially not for that price."
"great sound, good fit and very well made."
"the little pouch is a nice add-on, too."

these exceeded my expectations.  
the sound was very good.  
they can be used to talk on the phone.  
"i really liked that i could change the music to go to the next song, previous song, or even pause it.  "
then i could call up google.  
the sound was nice.  
it was crisp but not sharp.  
the ear pieces fit very well.  
definitely recommend using those.  
"the only drawback with these is that when the volume is raised, the sound seems to emit from the back of the buds.  "
"it's not bad, just something i noticed."
i was so excited to get this product.
i plugged it into my laptop
"and i got sound, but the volume up, down and pause buttons, do not work."
i plugged them into my phone.
i got sound.
"the volume up, down and pause button do not work!"
i am so disappointed.
i decided to pay more especially for this function.
"i could have gotten a cheaper headphone that did not have the volume remote, but chose this one because the reviews said it was awesome."
"i don’t know if a received a defective one, but i will be returning."
update!!!!i was contacted by the seller who apologized that this product did not work for me.
"she offered to send me a different product to try and by the next day, the new product arrived as promised."
i would give this seller 5 stars for going the extra mike to resolve issues with their products and i would especially like to thank elsa for her great customer service.
"i am changing my overall experience to 4 stars, because the new product did work, but the sound quality could be better."
"however, i would definitely recommend this seller, as they do their best to give a great customer service experience to anyone who buys their product."
thanks elsa!
okay so i wear ear buds at the gym
and i can't get into wireless ones because i like my music loud.  
wireless ones don't have any decent volume.
i've owned all sorts of low ($5) to mid priced ($15)
wired
ear buds
and they all sound pretty similar.  
i wanted more
so i decided to try these.
they are good.  
sound quality is at least as good as the cheaper options.  
"not dramatically better but at least as good, and maybe a tiny bit better."
but they do indeed get louder than any others i've tried.  
"so much so that i can't leave it at full volume, i have to dial it back a notch now."
so they are louder and at least as good as others (maybe slightly better).  
if that's worth the $30 price tag to  
you then go for them.
decided to buy this mainly for the good reviews.
both buds have static and sounds horrible.
i'm not sure if i got a defective one or what
but i'm really disappointed.
"i think that the title summarizes my opinion quite well, but obviously that's not going to be enough to convince most people so i'll elaborate."
"after getting my pair to review, naturally the first thing i did was try them on: and what immediately struck me was how light they were."
unlike a lot of the other headphones i've tried they really did fit in my ear perfectly without needing to resort to being true in-ears.
"despite this lightweight feel they also stayed in despite my usual ""shake my head for a bit to see if they fall out"" test."
the other important trait to consider in these headphones is sound
and i have to say initially wasn't that convinced.
"my more recent tracks on my spotify playlist consist of trap, guitar heavy, and techno songs that didn't sound as punchy as some of my other headphones."
"however, where these absolutely destroyed just about everything else i have is vocals."
"i kid you not, the only headphones that beat it out for 80'sand 90's music (yes i like 80's music,"
and before i get asked my favorite is your love by the outfield) in this department were my sennhesiers.
they were crisp and clear; i liked them so much that i stopped carrying my bluetooth headphones and switched to these for my daily use as i initially intended these to just be for my switch.
"not to mention some of the other benefits of having a wire again: one less thing for me to charge, there's virtually no delay or connection dropping, and they're harder to lose."
obviously there are drawbacks such as the wire getting in the way or the wire length maybe being too short for every need
but for me these were worth that hassle.
also to their credit i've definitely abused them quite a bit since i have gotten used to the wireless lifestyle and they ended up getting pulled and crushed here
and there
but they still work just fine which frankly is a miracle.
if you need a wired pair of headphones these are a good investment.
context: i was looking for some new ear buds for my daughter because her new cellphone didn't come with them.
summary:
"overall, these ear buds are good."
"they are not the best i have ever used in regards to comfort, sound or quality; but the value of these ear buds is very high."
"i think for the cost, they are worthy of a 4-star review; but i wouldn't pay too much more for these before they would drop in overall value to three-stars."
so just make sure you monitor the price on sites like 'camel' and make sure you are getting a good deal.
"if so, these will definitely serve your purpose."
"pros:great valuegood sound, but not as good as my samsung s8+ stock sound (that comes from phone)comfort is above average."
"they don't have any rubber/silicone sleeves on them, so it is just hard plastic."
"despite that, they fit my ears relatively well."
"i do know that my ears usually have some difficulty fitting ear buds...for whatever reason, and these do a good jobconsnot cons, unless price increases, or you are looking for 5-star sound quality."
plastic ear buds with no silicone covers.
this
"i think creates a less comfortable fit, but it isn't necessarily bad."
it is really all about preferenceconclusion:
"overall, i think that these are great for the price range, but again, they are just a spare set in order to give to my daughter."
kids will never know any better in terms of sound quality.
"so if you are looking for a great backup set for yourself, or a really well-priced set for someone who may not be as audio-technical, these are an excellent option."
"i was really excited to get some nice-looking earphones with great sound quality, as the reviews suggest."
"however, i was very disappointed to find that the sound quality is not great."
"everything sounds much better on my headphones, and on the previous set of earbuds that i had lost."
those earbuds were only $6 too.
don't invest in these unless you only care about the look of the earbuds.
update:
i ended up returning them after trying them for a few days.
the accessories were probably the best part of the purchase.
"i especially liked the earhooks that kept them in my ears, but the sound quality was not worth it for me."
update:
the company contacted me and sent me another pair of earbuds.
i was strongly suggested to use the earbuds with the ear hooks for better sound quality.
"i can't tell if the ear hooks make a large difference, but this pair is definitely better than the previous pair i received."
i assume the last pair i got was just defective.
update:
i didn't realize that elsa from linklike's customer service was sending me a separate shipment of just earhooks from aha style.
the earhooks definitely make a huge difference!
"the sound quality is much improved, and i have no complaints anymore."

i really like it
", especially it comes with a little bag for me to keep the headphone."
i will say that i really think the sound is very good.  
and they look really nice and stylish.  
the only thing i have a little problem with is that i do have to keep pushing them back into place often.  
but i am very pleased with the sound.  
i may have to return them if i can’t get them to stay in.  
"as for noise cancelling, yes, they do a fair job at that.  "
i like that they are not completely noise
cancelling bc
i can use them at work and can still know if someone talks to me.
"i still have to remove one bud to clearly hear what they are saying, but i can hear enough to know they are trying to get my attention.  "
the only reason i gave them a 4 star rating is bc
i have to keep pushing them back in often.  
"but overall, yes, i would recommend them."
i bought these earbuds for my husband who wanted a pair of wired ones.
"he likes the wireless earbuds too, but says that they give him a headache."
"after looking for a while, i settled on these."
just the reviews of other people alone had a big impact on my decision.
that many people cannot be wrong.
"and yes, we agree, he likes the earbuds a lot."
"they are comfy, noise canceling and"
the sound quality is very good.
it seems that they have the best ergonomic design.
the included two pairs of ear tips really cancel out the exterior noise and help to enjoy music or whatever you are listening to.
the earphones cord is made of soft and flexible material and does not and tangle up.
"also, since they are wired, you cannot lose one earbud like you can with the wireless ones."
i lost (or someone lifted)
"my samsung wired earbuds, which were the best i've ever had for sound and"
"since i have narrow ear canals, by far the best fit i've had.  "
i was really disappointed as i couldn't find a replacement anywhere
and so many of the cheap wired earbuds on amazon get lousy reviews.  
"these are actually very good, perhaps slightly better for jazz, classical and acoustic music than for rock, but i like the sound on every type i've listened to.  "
"they have a very similar design to the samsung earbuds, where they sit comfortably in the outer ear with the speaker fitting into the opening of the ear canal, so quite comfortable.  "
"they don't have flattened non-tangle wires like the samsungs had, but i am hopeful they won't tangle as they are more substantial than most cords on inexpensive ear buds."
very pleased with them.
update:
"no noise canceling really, but still a good value imho"
color is probably the best feature but probably would have rather just invested my money with the apple oem ones.
i also for fun compared these with shure se535.for the price of $29.99
it's okay though.
and if you want more info feel free to read below.
noise cancelation
:i could still hear my fingers/thumb rubbing together when i put my hands out to my side with these earbuds one.
also fyi if you can't hear your fingers rubbing without earbuds i might recommend lowering your music levels on an overall bases.
bass replication:
the drivers seem to hit those lower notes but you don't hear them unless you either cup your hands around your ears or push the earbuds into your ear cannel which is kind of a misnomer because who is actually going to do this when using this product.
i would honestly mention that unless you are putting the headphones full blast and lowering the mids and highs considerably/who can do this on their phone really🤷

*not recommended will cause hearing loss)
you aren't really going to get much bass out of these.
volume control:i like that these earbuds have them
but i wish instead of circular
they made them more flatter to make pressing the buttons easier.
the roundness of the volume control makes it difficult to control/grasp.
"these earphones have the potential to sound quite good, but they don't fit my ears very well to get the best possible sound, so i find myself constantly twisting and pushing and trying to get them to fit more deeply in my ears to get more bass response."
"secondly, the shape of the volume control/microphone unit is not well designed from a human factors point of view."
the cylindrical shape makes it trickier to find and press the correct button.
"with some overall redesign, this could be a 4- or 5-star product."
update:
"as a result of my less than 5-star review, i was contacted by the vendor and offered a full refund on my purchase of these earphones."
"they have continued to follow up to ensure my satisfaction, so i can say with complete confidence that if you have any problem or complaint about these linklike classic 2, you can rest assured that they will do whatever they can to address your issues."
"furthermore, after additional use of these earphones, i feel the sound quality is better than i originally experienced."
"if they fit your ears better than mine, i expect you'll be quite pleased with their sound reproduction."
and you will be fully supported by the vendor if you're not satisfied.
i've added a star to my review.
i like my bluetooth earbuds
"but when they're charging or when i'm in a situation where i might jar them loose, i like to use wired earbuds."
this pair works quite well and sound very good.
"they come with two pair of soft silicone adapters to fit different size ear canals, but i get the best fit without them."
the slim little microphone pod (blister?
bulge?)
"on their cord gives control of the volume, next/previous song selection, and call answer/reject and hang up."
and when i'm not wearing them i appreciate that there's a nice leather-like pouch to store them in to protect them from damage.

updateso i reached out to amazon regarding the issue that i was facing and the connected me to the company.
i have to say they have really amazing customer service.
they reached out to me immediately and provided me with a new pair of ear hooks.
i've been using these ear hooks for some hours now and they don't seem to be causing much discomfort.
five stars for an absolutely amazing customer service experience and valuing the customers.
the reason i am giving 3 stars is because the headphones are uncomfortable to wear for me.
it might just be the case only for me though.
i am usually picky about my inear headphones and for past few years i've been using the same brand of mi piston that are both reasonably priced and comfortable but recently their quality has gone down
and so i wanted to switch.
i would probably absolutely love these headphones had it not been for the discomfort that i am feeling.
the quality is really good.
"clarity, volume, bass are all top notch and sound cancellation works brilliantly well."
overall i am pleasently surprised that such good quality is offered at the price they are offering it.
the leather pouch is a great touch and i would definitely use it (unless i decide to return if these headphones continue to be uncomfortable for me).
they provided two types of tips to cover the headphones which is good.
overall i would recommend this product despite the comfort issues that i am facing.
i put on some skrillix and tested these out on my phone-  sound was great.  
a good amount of bass.  
they come with a few different ear pieces / covers which is nice.  
i just use the basic ones and they stay in my ears great.  
i haven't worn them to work out or anything
yet i just like to have a pair of these wired ones to have on hand and the last ones i had went through the wash in my pants pocket...
which may have been a happy accident because i like the sound of these ones a lot better.  
i am happy with the purchase.
it came in really nice packaging as well.
"at first, these plugs would not even partially stay in the ears.  "
almost worthless.
-1
star.  
their customer service contacted me and provided a fitting that was apparently designed for apple wireless buds.  
these fixed the situation.  
now the sound is quite good.  
"this companies customer service goes above and beyond anything that you might expect in today's current ""oh well"" environment."
"these are an odd design that just would not work without a modification, but once modified  sound as good as any other ear bud in this price range.  "
"tried these on a smartphone, sound was adequate.  "
"tried these on two portable dac players, sound was fantastic  with more bass response."
"pros:-sound is indeed fantastic - ranging from rock, electro to classical orchestra; it sounds great!-the classic style of the earbuds instead of the annoying meta in-ear buds.-mic and volume controls works for my 5 year old android (note 4)cons:"
construction - all but the earbuds itself feels like it could break at anytime.
"even the third time using and having phone in pocket, i'm already getting cut-outs from listening which i presume is from the short headphone jack bending against the phone."
price: $25 - i could buy 3 edifiers for the price of one of these.
the imbalance of good sound quality and the lack of what seems to be bad construction of the wire itself does not seem worth to me.
placement of the mic
: why is the mic/volume control located on the right side?!?!?
"my old skullkandy, samsung oem headphones are located on the left."
tl:dr -
for $25 you get great sound quality in expense for lack of good construction and improper placement of the mic.
"earphones or earbuds look amazing, easily the best looking earbuds at this price-point that i’ve seen.  "
the sound is pretty superior.
"highs, mid-range, and most impressively, bass is good."
"bass is strongest, most fully present, than in any wired earbud i've listened to or own."
everything sounds clear in headphones.
earbuds
fit the ears perfectly fine.
the fit is perfect for my ears - very ergonomic as the bud rests nicely in the ears.  
"i can assure you these earbuds, when properly fitted, sound great."
"earphones are light, and the cord is durable or flexible."
"i would say the headphones have excellent sound quality, great look and feel of the construction and nice quality materials, the volume is great on the headphones everything is very nice."
"really good price, great sound and overall good build quality design."
"if you are looking for a clear, low bass, and stable sound for the ears"
then this is the one for you.  
headphones accurately reproduce music very well.
i would recommend them.
sounds like you're in some tunnel; no base barely any mids.
this needs to go back to the development boards.
i really liked these earbuds.
they had good weight to them and the bass was superior.
"i'm very sad, however, because they broke after only 6 months."
"i take very good care of my electronics because i want them to last, so it wasn't from extreme wear and tear."
"the right earbud lost the little mesh screen that sits on the inside edge, which is designed to protect from dust and dirt."
i don't know how this fell out or where/
when.
i wasn't even aware that it wasn't built in (which it should have been).
now i have to buy a new pair
and i doubt i'll buy these again if something like that happens after only 6 months of use.
"the other negative of these earbuds is the ""noise cancellation"" feature."
it doesn't work as intended.
i bought these for work and even at max volume
i can still hear the chatty women who sit near me.
not impressed by this so called feature.
update:
seller contacted me and apologized for my bad experience.
"they offered to send me a new pair of earbuds to replace the old, broken ones and even sent me a gift to help with the noise cancellation!"
"i received both really fast, so i'm giving an extra star for customer service and one more for addressing an additional problem even though they didn't have to."
these are the best wired in-ear headphones i've owned.
i am impressed with the quality of the sound.  
"the tech is unique and if you have small ears like mine, it's worth purchasing the compatible anti slip ear-tips."
i travel in a busy noisy subway system and they help reduce outside noise.
now i take these with me wherever i go.
this product is ahead and moving in the right direction.
i'm really starting to appreciate this purchase.
edit:
"although these headphones did not work for me as i have small ears, i kept them as my spouse has larger ears, and they are amazing headphones as far as sound quality goes."
"however, i edited my review to 5 stars as i have not encountered customer service like this online or in person!"
amazing customer service!these headphones seem to be amazing quality for the price.
"the sound quality is excellent, and they do block the majority of ambient noise."
"however, i have smaller than average ears, and these earbuds did not fit."
i could not find a comfortable position for these to be in my ears without causing discomfort.
i did give them to my spouse as they have larger ears than myself.
"she did try them and loved them immediately, impressed with the sound quality."
may update as to longevity.
these earphones are hidden gems for the price they are asking!
"the pair of bose earphones i’d had for nearly ten years finally died on me, but i wasn’t willing to shell out a bose just yet for a new pair."
"i decided to try some cheap pairs off amazon and it has been a very frustrating process of finding ones that had decent sound, simple controls, or one that didn’t suddenly change volume on it’s own."
"i even tried a bluetooth set, and although the sound was okay, using it drained the heck out of my iphone."
when i saw these earphones listed i was at my wits
"end and wasn’t sure i was willing to fork over $30 for another potentially low quality set, or just throw in the towel and buy a bose again."
i’m 5 weeks away from delivering my baby
and i wanted something reliable when it’s time for me to go into labor.
i am so glad i took the chance!
the sound on these are very comparable to my old bose—and i was not expecting that!
"bass is on point, sound quality is crystal clear."
controls are simple (though i do need to get used to how small it is in comparison to others).
i am all around very pleased.
"time will tell how they hold up, but currently i have zero complaints."
"decent sound quality, super comfy in ear"
this is the first time i’ve felt compelled to contribute an amazon review.
i was moved to do so by an excellent product backed by impeccable customer service.
these are wonderful earbuds that should delight nearly everyone.
"their sound is powerful, warm, vibrant and very clear, with an immersive quality that really enhances the listening experience."
"i own several high-end headphones and in-ear monitors from sennheiser, v-moda, audio-technica, and westone, among others."
these little gems from linklike have a performance to price point ratio that compares favorably with anything in my collection.
"there will always be those who find a reason to complain, but i listen to a variety of classical and popular genres and these haven’t let me down yet."
"in addition, if you enjoy listening to contemporary audio drama or old time radio, these earbuds have a surround sound quality that make it feel like you’re in the middle of the action, or perhaps standing alongside the performers at the microphone."
it’s a lot of fun!
"also, if you enjoy vintage recordings, they impart a wonderful depth and clarity to good source material that reminds me of the best remastering efforts of the late robert parker."
"after purchasing this item, i received a follow-up email from linklike asking if i was satisfied."
"without being intrusive, they reminded me of my 1-year warranty and offered any additional assistance i might require."
"later, their representative even helped me to get the best possible fit and seal by sending along some wonderful ear hooks."
where else can you get such sincere personal attention in the aftermath of a very modest online investment?treat yourself to a pair of these.
i hope and trust that you will enjoy them very much.
this is my preferred design for ear buds and this particular set has great sound.
"when you don't want to spend a kagillion dollars, but you want quality sound, you have to shop around."
in this price range you often find what should be a $5 being sold for $25.
these from linklike exceed what you'd expect at this price range.
"i haven't tested the mic, but for music these are great."
"i will be very content with these as my next earbuds, so the next time they go on sale i will pick up a backup pair."
the earbuds feel premium (piano black) and are clearly labeled l/r (which isn't always the case).
i wish the wires were higher quality.
the inline control is terrible -- it is round and smooth and the buttons are flat.
by touch you don't know if you are on the side with the buttons or what button you are pushing.
"i had issues with the initial pair, but elsa with cornfield audio customer service quickly sent out a replacement."
"i don't like earbuds that go in my ear canal, which is why i picked these."
they fit in the outer ear.
the price is maybe a bit high.
they come in decent packaging and include a leather like storage bag.
you also get a second set of rubber earpiece covers with a rubber hook that fits in your ear lobe for stability.
the standard earpiece covers don't include the hook.
the sound is ok.
"obviously all ""sound"" observations are subjective."
i don't play my music really loud.
"i do pay attention to having the lows, mids, and highs actually there and balanced."
i don't expect earbuds with a 5mm or so driver to rattle my scull.
neither do i wish to go deaf.
"but, i do expect the tones to be reasonably present."
"i compared these to my shure srh240a over the ear headphones (probably unfair), some $ 9 earbuds, and my good old jvc gummy earbuds (with no mic) (~ $ 15)."
"as one might expect, the shure headphones with ~ 40 mm drivers beat out all earbuds for bass."
"even so, these earbuds are a little weak on bass and mids."
the highs sound reasonably good.
i tested with a celtic woman concert and the performers and the instruments
sounded a little thin and bass was lacking.
"overall, these have the worst sound of any of the cheap earbuds i have."
i don't have any really premium earbuds to compare to.
","
"but, even if i did, that wouldn't be fair."
"these are, after all, about $ 30 headphones."
"while the quality seems good otherwise, i think the price is high for the sound."
"i've made one phone call with these, and the other party said the sound coming from my mic was fine."
"from my point of view, the call sounded fine."
i had a problem with the buttons though.
you may or may not care about that.
"on my android 9 moto phone, the volume up and down buttons work fine."
the play / pause button works fine.
"presumably, answering or hanging up a call would also be fine."
"on my old android 5 asus tablet, though, the volume buttons don't work at all."
the play / pause button works fine.
"so, the bottom line is, pretty good quality but"
just ok sound.
no volume control on my android 5 tablet.
(my gummy's have no buttons at all though.)
some people complain about them not having magnets to join them together for storage.
"i don't mind, since strong magnetic fields near your brain are a bad idea."
"the feel of the ""stalks"" that you would use to pick up the earbuds near the earpiece are a bit thin and hard to pick up if you're driving."
"the button and mic module is a round cylindrical piece, and it's a bit hard to position the buttons in your fingers without looking."
"overall, those things are minor."
"i will probably use this for cell phone calls, but will stick to other earbuds for music."
hope this helps.
ron
i bought these headphones for talking on the phone.
they work great for the most part and are superior to most other headphones i have tried for this purpose.
i am generally impressed by the quality and the microphone works quite well.
"the one frustrating thing about them is that whenever i plug them into my computer, the microphone doesn't work until you press a button on it."
perhaps a small complaint but no other headphones
i have had do this and it has become quite frustrating when i use the microphone so often.
edit:
my only real problem was the comfort level of the ear buds.
"after seeing my review, linklike reached out and sent me ear hooks, and i have to say, the comfort has improved dramatically."
i still wouldn't say they're the most comfortable
"ear buds i've worn,"
but they're now certainly at least average in that department.
"combined with the good sound and build quality, i'd definitely say they're worth the money."
and i always appreciate a company going the extra mile to make sure each customer is satisfied.
old review:
"the sound and build quality are both quite high, given the price point."
if only i could use them for more than 5-10 without discomfort.
"size-wise, they're basically identical to apple earbuds, but they are definitely not the same shape."
"i don't doubt these felt fine for a majority of users, but i can only speak for myself."
"despite the note ""reach out if it didn't fit well."
"we will offer you an effective solution"", i was not offered a solution when i said they didn't fit in an email, either."
"i had high hopes for these earbuds, and in many ways they met those, but if they're not comfortable enough to use, it doesn't matter how good the bass is."
so just a fair warning: these are not a one-size-fits-all pair of earbuds.
"they may be totally comfortable for you, or they may not be."
update:
"after putting some earhooks on these, it brought bass up to a good level, a level better than the earpods."
"so now, the audio is pleasant to listen to."
"the reason i personally raised it to 4 stars, not 5, it because in putting on those earhooks, it isolated all the background noise, which for most of you, will be seen as a feature, but i like this design because it allows me to hear what's going on around me."
"for the past couple of weeks, after finding out my apple earbuds don't work with my ps4, i've been searching for a pair of earbuds with similar sound, and the same form factor (the earbud style fits perfectly in my ears)."
this is the third pair on that search.
"the first two were okay, maybe 60% of the audio quality, and a little more uncomfortable, but they were $12 each, so i didn't leave a review, just returned them."
"but these are $30, and had amazing reviews, so i figured that these had to be the ones."
"they're charging more than apple for their earbuds, and they're making claims about it being high quality audio with more bass, so i figured i would take a shot on them."
i'll make this as simple as possible with a pros and cons list.
pros- comfortable.
they fit probably better than the earbuds do in my ear.
"very lightweight.- mic sounds decent, haven't used it in a noisy area though."
cons- awful sound quality.
worse than all the $12 earbud knock-offs i had tried before this.
"the only way i can describe the audio is that it is flat, but with mids recessed a good amount."
"so no dynamics, and no clarity in vocals or guitar."
not sure how they managed that.- no latch to connect the earbuds when you pack them up.
"at more than the apple earbuds, it needs it.- build isn't bad, but it definitely doesn't inspire confidence."
less sturdy than the apple earbuds.
moral of the story.
these are worth about $5 based on audio quality.
"if you are looking to spend this much and like the design (not having tips shoved into your ear) get the apple earbuds, unless you want to use them for chat with a game console, in that case, im still searching."
"there are a lot of headphones and earbuds we've gone through, most of which the quality of the sound and the ability to drown out noise around out without blasting the music full blast was very poor quality."
decided to give these a try and the so far they are great!
"the sound quality is clear, they fit easily in the ear without fitting too big or too small, and even talking on the phone has been such better quality."
"sound control has worked beautifully so far, as has the microphone."
for once people can really hear when talking using headphones likes these.
really appreciate these and hope they last a long time.
first impression...
i like these!
build quality appears very good.
cable has a good feel.
click on controls appears good.
no noise canceling because these are like apple airpods or their standard wired earbuds
so that is not a defect.
sound is pretty clear and low end is not bad.
"buds are shiny black, smooth, and fairly heavy, not a bad thing."
case is junk but you probably already have one
", i’m using a hard case i had laying around."
they seem a little bit pricey but you can hear where your money went.
"these headphones sound great, and support has been helpful in assisting me."
"i used viper4android, which has magical ddc/irs (convolver) functionality."
the support provided me a graph for the frequency response
so i could manually neutralize the sound (which is why some headphones are sold expensive.
viper4android makes cheap headphones sound professional).
"unfortunately, my only complaint is that the frequency response has some big dips, which makes the software tuning less effective."
"the noise isolation from the environment is, null."
"it's like open back headphones, so if you like hearing the environment these are excellent, except i hate hearing most background noise."
"my family is split in two, my husband loves his wireless headphones and i can't do anything that doesn't have a cord."
i buy him wireless headphones and for myself i buy wired
and i'm all set.
"i love these headphones, they fit great in my ear"
(i can't wear the ones that just go in ear without the support).
most headphones just fall off my ear but these i can even run with.
they are also very sleek and modern looking and
the black color really is shiny.
"the earbuds fall out of my ears consistently, even with the slightest movement."
no noticeably noise cancellation.
"however, the microphone appears to work very well for phone calls."
these earbuds are one of the rare few earbuds at this price where no one on the other line has complained about not being to hear me or lousy voice quality.
it would be great if the earbuds actually stayed on so i can use it on the go instead of having to set camp every time to make or take a phone call.
great sounding headphones with in-line controls work through my dongles for
both my work iphone 8
+
and my personal pixel 3xl.
"the cable is the perfect length - about as long as those that come bundled with oem phones, and they don't use rubber tips which can fall off, rendering them useless until you can replace the tips."
i keep these headphones as a backup in my everyday bag so that i can use them for either phone if my bluetooth headset goes dead.
my only complaint is that the controls aren't as fast to use as the wired buds that come included with my iphone or pixel.
"instead of a flat rocker design, it's barrel shaped with physical buttons that you have to kind of fumble a little bit to locate."
"this is a minor complaint, however."
buy these headphones!
after you try these earphones you will not go back to any other!  
"they are comfortable even for my small ears, extremely durable"
but the real kicker is the amazing sound quality.  
"when listening to music it sounds, to me, like i am actually at the concert and not sitting in the car.  "
works great with my samsung phone as well.
"i have never written a review for a product before, but everyone looking at these headphones should know about the issues i had."
"first off, it feels like really thin cheap plastic and the wires are also thin."
of course i still tried them out
and i kept getting constant static in the right ear bud.
"kept taking the aux out and putting it back in, same problem."
started pressing the buttons to see if it might fix it; ended up finding out that the volume up button doesn't work.
had to give it one star..
how do you mess up wired headphones and also charge $30 for them?
"seriously, you had one job."
sound quality: 3.5 out of 5 stars.
"it's a good sound, but not good enough to either compensate for other shortcomings or give sense of good value for the money."
noise cancelation: 2 star.
doesn't exist.
volume control: 3 stars.
the control buttons are very slim
so they hard to press right sometimes.
the volume control location is so high near
the right ear
you can't see what you are pressing without either feeling your way around or take the headphones off to see which button you need to press.
materials quality:4 out of 5 stars.
the earpiece covers are the cheapest part of it.
"these headphones work as headphones and as a ""headset""."
"i specifically bought these for using on my pc for conference calls, but also listening to music/podcasts while i work."
"they stay in my ears (don't fall out), and the sound quality is fine."
"i am not an audiophile, so i can't really say much about the sound quality."
"i have no complaints in that regard, however."
"the ""noise cancelling"" is non-existent."
"i have used other earbuds and have had significant noise reduction from those, but these don't block external noises much at all."
"essentially, they are equivalent to the earbuds that come with the iphone."
"additionally, these headphones are painful to wear for more than an hour or so."
"i have never had this kind of discomfort when wearing headphones, but these go beyond mere discomfort."
it is almost like they are too thick when the little rubber covers are attached.
"however, without the little rubber covers, they fall out."
these were definitely not worth the cost.
"having owned many different brands of ear buds/head phones, i would rate these 7 out of 10.  "
placement in your ears is very critical.  
mid tones and high end tones are crisp.  
"depending on how they fit in your ear, the bass can be deep or very muddy to non-existent.  "
you definitely have to experiment how they fit.  
it would be nice if the ear buds could rotate a few degrees on the stem.  
yo get them to reproduce a solid bass tone i have to rotate them which results in an uncomfortable fit.
edit:  
i was contacted by customer support and they had genuine concern for the way these fit my ears.  
they emailed and called me.  
they also sent me a pair of ear hooks that made the sound much better.
"these headphones are really good quality ,  i can barely hear what’s going on around me when i have the volume up all the way listening to music .  "
"the clarity of my music is excellent and the phone calls as well, no static, no lagging."
the buds in my ear excellent.  
i highly recommend these headphones .
they are awesome!!
these have some of the best sound that i have ever heard.
"the bass is deep, the treble is high but not distorted."
they sound like a professional quality headphone set.
they come in a nice box and are very very comfortable to wear.
"the cord is long enough that your not running into issues, but also not too long to where it is constantly getting tangled."
great pair!
for the price i paid this would be a good spare headset
and i didnt expect much.
boy was i wrong.
this was one of the best unboxing i have had in a awhile.
the package arrived in good shape and it was fast.
the sound is amazing and the quality is outstanding.
after a week they became my primary headset.
"with 3 teenagers who live with these things in an ear or a pocket, i don't know how i didn't think to look for this before."
the kids love the way the cord is braided seems to tangle much less often
these headphones are a great value.
four for ten dollars can’t be beat.
only small issue is the volume control is a bit to sensitive.
for the price i’m not complaining.
just as expected - great four pack of simple earbuds with nice shiny accent colors so that you can tell them apart.  
my teen son said they looked “cool”
and i agreed!  
"love them and they work great (have only used with ipad and laptop to watch movies, and have not used microphone, but they work perfectly for planes and such)."
great price for 4-pairs!
"i was just looking for cheap headphones to tide me over until i could buy some good bluetooth ones, these pleasantly surprised me."
"the cord feels really strange for some reason, but they fit in the ear"
well and
the sound quality is pretty good.
"i've been looking for a pair to use for work and calls, and these were perfect."
"the sound quality is great, the noise cancellation works pretty well, it doesn't pick up as much background noise as other earphones, and i like that the mic is closer up top, so i can use it hands free."
"i love that the cords are thicker, flat and more dense."
it doesn't not get as tangled as the other thinner ones.
"for the money these are good, they fit perfectly and better than the sony headphones i usually buy."
pleasantly surprised at the quality and performance.
took this on a recent international trip.
"like everyone else, i've listened through many different wired and unwired headphones."
the base in these are unequalled.
mid-range and highs are equally as good.
definitely going to buy another pair.
sound is great.
impressed with the plastic-coated cords.
excellent value.
great headphones for the price.
"give these to your kids and when they break/ loose them, it won't hurt in the bank."
very good sound quality for this price.  
the volume control is a plus
great inexpensive ear buds.
very comfortable and easy to use.
sound is decent and they are light and don’t get easily tangled.
a terrific buy and nice to have a couple extra pairs lying around when the nieces are over and have lost theirs!
if you're looking for bang for buck here it is.
i was prepared for one of these sets of earphones to be bad and would still be happy but all three sound and work great.
honestly they sound better than my old ones that cost more and now i have extras.
do not recommend.
broke apart after only a couple days.
used it maybe 2 times before the volume control piece broke off randomly.
didn’t even drop it.
can’t figure out how to contact seller
i thought i was buying braided earbuds but received smooth plastic cables.
still the audio quality is fine and a very good value.
will see how they hold up over time.
they work perfectly for listening to music and taking calls.
"also, 3 for this price was the best deal i've seen for earbuds"
"and they work just as good that the more expensive ones, so i'm happy!"
"i use headphones to watch movies on my tablet when i'm riding in the car or something, and these were super affordable, have great sound quality, and arrived in only a few days."
i was very impressed.
i could not believe this awesome buy!!
"they are well made, nice long cords, comfortable in the ears and the sound and voice quality is great too."
super good buy.
they work perfectly.
awesome quality.
great price for good quality earbuds.
quality seems fine but the cord is a little short for me
"sound great,comfortable and most importantly stay in my ears."
better than i thought it would be
these are much better than i expected
great sound!!
great sound!!
what i loved.  
the rubber coating on the cables helped in preventing tangling.  
i used these headphones with translation devices
"so i kept wrapping cables around devices, storing multiple headphones together and the cables did not tangle.  "
"the sound quality was good, the headphones are excellent considering the price.  "
i will purchase again when needed.
these headphones are a steal for the price
and i really like them.
i have these in my car because sometimes when i’m giving cat rides i don’t want the people to hear what i’m listening too on the radio and these give me that privacy.
they connect easily and the sound quality is amazing.
i don’t have to worry about them connecting to my cars bluetooth capabilities.
i even had one person buy a pair from me.
nice sounds and great value!
my grandkids are going through headphones
so i thought i would buy a multi pack.
they really blew me away at the quality.
i hope they will hang on to these a little longer since they are so nice!
nice earbuds.
used them with my ipad and love them.
nice sound quality.
well worth the money.
kids liked them too!
"inexpensive, but reliable with good soundgreat choice of color for those who like to match with what you wear."
great sound for the price as well.
comfortable to wear with this design.
i let my nieces and nephews use this.
great for them.
excellent quality!
crisp clear sound!!
i like the different colors to choose from.
easy to plug in and start using.
good sound quality and fits as expected.
great for kids.
they feel weird due to the cord being twisted but work great.
just plug in and listen.
"very comfortable,  great sound and a great value with the 4 pack.  "
good buy
love these.
they fit nicely and don't hurt your ears.
sound quality is really nice.
so perfect!
great product and easy to use
purchased them to load large files from security camera systems.
they work fast and well.
working fine.
i used this to put my music on and leave permanently in my car and forget about it.
i have not had an issue with it.
if i do in the future i will change this review.
price was fair and it arrived very quickly.
"hard to find and one my daughter absolutely had to have, and she enjoys very much."
i’m happy to have bought it and the ship time was reasonable.
love these -- so comfortable and great fit for a plus size!  
do not purchase
the just love women sleep pajamas -- they sit way too low in the rise for a plus size.  
i made the mistake of buying them and figured they would be like dreams & co -- no way!
we never realized what a racket the old pump made until this one was installed!
"it is very quiet even at high speed, we can barely it at low speed."
this 1 hp 2-speed pump replaced a 3/4 hp hayward super pump.
"our kreepy krauly cleaner would sometimes fall off the walls if the suction was not just right, now it stays put and reaches further and much faster."
please note that at this time the pictures on amazon shows the single speed version.
"this model actually has a speed controller mounted on the top of the motor, and has a switch at the end to control the speeds as shown in picture."
"love it, so easy to put together, and using it weekly."
you do need to have 3 short (30 min) fires to set the paint.
lucklly i called to ask what the little bottle they included was because those directions weren't anywhere.
the little bottle is paint in case it gets scuffed in transit.
"i did get some bricks from home depot to put underneath it so it wouldn't burn the deck, which was really smart because you do have to have the plate in the bottom slightly askew and open to get the air in for the fire to burn."
(directions explaining that would have been helpful too)
so live coals do fall out frequently.
so just know there is some prep.
but i do absolutely love it.
i have this on a bookshelf in a darker corner of my room
so it draws attention and luminates the bookshelf a bit.
"it has pretty standard led colors, nothing too crazy aside from a strobing mode which i'll probably never use."
it's definitely interesting to look at due to its unique shape.
"the base is made of wood so you can easily paint it if you desire,"
which i'll probably do so it can better match my furniture.
"if you hold the power button for a few seconds, itll turn off the led light."
this is the faster way of turning off the light.
you can also turn off the light by cycling through all the colors and modes.
i'm a pediatric icu nurse and at work we need hats for sterile procedure all the time.
"line changes, dressing changes, etc.."
one of my best freinds has one
and i've always thought it was cute.
so i bought one late at night one night out of the blue.  
i searched around for different styles and decorations.
i really love hello kitty
so this was a perfect for me.  
plus the hat wasn't that expensive.
so i received it in the mail and it came in a nice little pouch of
it's one for storing.
the colors are vibrant and stand out.
the kitties are printed well.
i absolutely love this hat.
the first night at work when i wore it
all my co-workers noticed my cute new hat.
the hat fits perfectly.
it has a nice elastic piece onto the back that you can tighten.
i also have very long hair (down the middle of my back)
and if i put it up in a pony tail it fits perfectly under the hat.
"long story short, if you work in a hospital and you need a hat"
and you like
hello kitty
this hat is perfect.
two thumbs up.
i recently began a journey into ethiopian cuisine and one recipe called for besobela to make an ingredient called niter kibbeh.
i was surprised to find it (and another herb used for clarification) on amazon.
the fulfillment process was timely and the product was as advertised.
the doro wat (spiced chicken) was very good.
i bought these bags to store my yarn skeins.  
i can put three skeins of yarn in one of these bags to keep it clean while being stored or  while being crochet into a project.  
"some times things get spilled near the yarn, and this protects it.  "
"also,  it aids in separating different colors."
"this very small, very fast surprisingly expandable mini pc is very good value."
this mini  elitedesk gets the job done.
it has everything you need to perform day to day tasks.
"i mainly use it for web browsing , youtube, and research.  "
i also like that you can customize the ram and hard drive to meet different needds.
"it 's pretty quiet & small, and it does not take much of space."
i put my monitor on top of it.
"i wondered to myself, ""could i save space and have loud deep bass from a single 12"" subwoofer?"""
"this sundown z-12 is, in a word, stunning!"
"just the single 12"" sub in a 2.02 cuft cabinet tuned to 32 hz"
"(subtracting the thickness of wood, bracing, and the speaker volume) on a rockford fosgate 1200.d1 was loud enough that i must turn it down to be courteous to my neighbors and other cars at the stop lights."
i wanted a sub that plays all music well and can crank it up when i find a good track.
now i understand why sundown audio is the top brand in sub woofers.
it's everything i wanted and much more than i expected.
this flash drive came in very handy during our travels in both india and china as we used our phones extensively to take pictures.  
in both countries both wifi and internet were frequently unavailable or poor
so we were not able to upload our photos to our google cloud account.  
in order to continue using our phones we were able to download the pictures and videos and move them to our computers and upload them later.  
takes a few minutes to figure out how to use but worked well.  
we both have google nexus phones.
this waterproof case is a great case too have.
very convenient for days at the water parks or swimming and definitely recommend for the ones who love
too take
pictures!!this case also comes with a strap to put around your neck like a necklace.
it's great
too have that because you don't have too worrie about loosing your phone while taking pictures underwater.
in my pictures it shows that i've placed my phone in the waterproof case and then placed it in a bowl of water.
this case is 100% waterproof .
when i took my phone put of the case there was no water in the inside of the case at all!i'm very excited
too be able too recieve this waterproof case for free in exchange for my honest review.
i love taking pictures
and i can't wait
too go on a beach trip and be able to take pictures near and under the water with out
my phone getting wet .
"i love these colors, i guess u could say these are my favorite colors, and i use these bags for my small business."
i've bought these before
"and i'm very happy with the size, and my customers seem to really like them too."
i have the 9x12 size and a lil bigger size as well.
"but i'm able to put candles, shirts, bath bombs, and other things i make into these bags easily."
shipping was fast so no complaints there
"and the bags are the exact same color as the photo, which i love."
finally got this little christmas gift put together!
my 3yr old daughter loves this go-kart!!
took about 30-45 min to put together.
unfortunately the directions were in german
so i had to go off the pictures.
still worked out and rides great!!

i am currently a competitive climber and wanted something that i could use on a pull-up bar to be able to increase my grip strength.  
"after reading several reviews on amazon and on other sites, i decided to purchase these."
"so far, i have used these for pull-ups and for doing cable rows and love them!"
i highly recommend these and material looks like it is built to last and even went through a torture test according to one youtube video.
we have been using this pacifier brand for going on 8 months and couldn’t be happier.
"we have had no issues with baby using them, and it is quite entertaining and sometimes useful to be able to see inside her mouth while she uses it."
we occasionally see a piece of fuzz
she’s managed to get in her mouth and can get it out before she eats it thanks to
he pacifier being clear .
"big love this wedding case and the fact that its supper clear, it’s the most beautiful case i have ever had."
this case keeps your phone looking sleek and sexy while offering great protection.
it's is made of a flexible material and all the edges come up over the phone for maximum protection.
i feel like my phone is totally safe.
"embossed super cute wedding dress, with wonderful diamonds, it’s perfect!!"
love it so much.
this is a five star rating for sure.
it is sleek and slim.
the shipping was really fast too!
i would definitely recommend getting one of those as well.
"if you’re looking for case that's thin and protects the frame of your phone from scratches or scuffs, or you love wedding dress, or you want buy a gift to your girl friends, this is the right case for you!!!"
i get so many laughs and compliments on this sweatshirt.
note that this is more like performance material and doesn't have fleece inside like you'd expect a sweatshirt to.
i prefer the material this pizza taco cat sweater is made of - as it dries faster and keeps you from sweating when working out hard on a cold day.
"also, when my sweater showed up cut from a box cutter, the seller sent me a new one for free."
my wife bough these - said she liked the colors and the design.
"when they arrived we both liked their quality and features: the hardcover, snap-in ruler, subject index, and smooth paper."
"good quality line,good price and good quick service."
good seller delivering good products.
look forward to checking out this new braided line on my bass rod.
i have an older generac xp8000e used for power backup during inclement weather.
i couldn’t find the exact model matching the factory carburetor.
"as advertised, this one matched seamlessly."
runs great.
"got one of these years ago in sanibel, fl and loved it."
"such a calming, soft sound..."
not metallic and tinny sounding.
needed a new one but had trouble finding the coconut shells...
everything was bamboo or capiz....
finally found it here and couldn't be happier!
just as soothing as i remember!!
"standard honda gx clone, but at a fraction of the cost."
shaft and mounting pattern matched old engine.
"added fuel and oil, fired up on the first pull."
"only small gripe would be that the fuel tank was labeled with ""use ultra-low sulfur fuel only."
""" this is not a diesel engine, but i doubt anyone would make that mistake."
really happy with this case.
i work at costco and have dropped my phone on the concrete floors too many times to count and never has there been any damage to my phone.
"true, it makes the iphone a bit bulky, but it can still fit in a pocket and honestly, it's a sacrifice i'm willing to make to protect my phone."
it comes with a screen protector and it has been rained on and dropped in a small puddle or two.
"again, my phone is store-new condition."
i write daily and have used these for over 12 years.  
"so far have filled over 30 of them, and have not found anything similar or better.  "
"the paper is good quality and doesn't ""bleed.""  "
"the books are light and portable, easy to travel with.  "
couldn't do without them.
it's nice to have disposable face masks available esp when i do cleaning in the house using spray that has chemicals.  
i always carry a few in my purse 'cause we are a family with sinus problems from dust to pollen.
we used this colorful writing journal for a guest registry for our wedding.
we had 230 guests and it was more than enough for folks to sign and leave us well wishes.
"we are also using the rest of the book to log gifts, cards and thoughts about our special day."
thank you!
it covers my my mouth with out feeling stuffy and comfortable around my ears.
also there individually wrapped so i don't have to worry about germ wise.
"except for it's being very slightly snug, i truly hesitate to tell how fine this jacket is because if i do tell the truth, the price will go way up.  "
it is doubtful you could find a comparable product anywhere for five to ten times the price.  
it's not thick but compressed and smooth and soft and warm and windproof even more so than similar items which have an extra layer of stiff stuff.  
"next time i want same kind of jacket, i hope the vendor remembers who made them famous.  "
unbelievable bargain!
large well laid out
i use it for my utility bag.  
"6 dedicated slots for usb drives, a pouch type holder for sd cards, elastic holders for sundry usb connector cables and a mesh bag section for miscellaneous paraphernalia"
.like dongles that just don't seem to fit anywhere.  
sort of a tool bag to be filled with whatever you think you might need.  
i plan to order a couple more just to organize my work area.

these chimes are better than the ones i got ten years ago.
"the round disks are 2&1/4 inches in diameter, and they make a deeper tone."
wow!
this lamp is much better than i expected.
"the light quality,light intensity and battery life are excellent."
my only concern is that this technology will rapidly advance during the next 12 to 24 months rendering this lamp out-of-date.
i use this as a reading lamp for a chair that has no adjacent electrical outlets.
it is perfect for my needs.
i would highly recommend this cordless lamp.
these little succulents are so cute.
i love the detail and they are going on a birdhouse for decor.
you will not be disappointed with these little guys.
love them
"i truly love this, when i 1st saw it i fell in love & a few wks later."
i said i must have this charm.
so i went on amazon to buy it
& it said 1 left in stock.
"i was like omg,"
so i whipped out my credit card & bought it really fast b4
someone else did.
i was waiting impatiently for this to arrive.
"and when i finally got it, i opened the box & inside was a completely different ugly charm."
i was so very sad
", i've written to you guys about this issue"
but i'm yet still waiting to hear from you?
i would really love to receive the charm i bought & paid for.
or at least contact me back & say that your sorry for the mix up.
thank you peggy sue
my wife was using these when she had serious post-nasal drip due to allergies.
they matched her work outfit and you hardly noticed she was wearing a face mask.
too little light in my kitchen
", so i installed several of these for my dying plants."
they are recouperating nicely!
reasonable price and highly recommend.
"fun, fun & more fun"
"there are a number of more expensive options available, some more than double the price."
i'd say give these a chance.
"they've been perfect for grip training, pullups and dumbell workouts for me and my kids who train bjj."
i weight 200lbs and these support my full weight just fine.
"my older daughter (in her early 20's) rented this game and loved it, so i got it for her for christmas."
"it's a very weird game, which is hard to describe, but the graphics are cool and the game itself is fun."
"the way the game is laid out is extremely creative and there are a lot of details that are really amazing that could be overlooked, so once you get the hang of the game or if you're just an observer"
it's amazing to catch some of these intricate details.
"very cute, useful, and  easy to intall！！！i am the person who can install almost nothing, but this cute table had a very clear installation instructions and are super easy!"
i always put this table on my bed when i am lying on the bed.
"it enables me to eat , do homework and do everything on the bed."
very useful for people who are like me!
amazing product!
"aside from bjj, i am a personal trainer at a local health club."
they are seeing daily use and are extremely well made.
i use them for pull ups mainly but have also used them with cable/pulley systems to work everything from cable squats to cable rows.
great product
the only gripe that i have is the pair i received does not look as cool as the ones pictured.
black is all blackblack.
no cool white logo and no badass red tape oninsideinside.
nside
great value on some basic notebooks.
really hit the spot on what i needed/wanted.
can customize and decorate easily!
i just got this in the mail today.  
perfect in every way so far!  
"did waterproof test, passed!  "
everything aligns perfectly with ports and buttons.
the strap will be a big help and the added cord for various headphone ports will be helpful as well.
"they should make more colors though, other than that it's great!"
got this for my girl.  
the pink is bright and the jacket is well-fitted.  
"ladies love it, and i do too."
best quilted liner i've used.  
"i have the ""man version"" of this jacket.  "
the cuffs are the most convenient of any jacket i own.
zipper guard at the bottom is nice.
"ventilation is significant, and in cold weather, you will get cold.  "
"in warm weather, you wont get too hot as long as you're moving."
excellent jacket.  
i own several and for style and comfort
this one is the go-to for her.
"bought these as a nod to my husband's texas heritage, though we live in another state.  "
make great stepping pavers.  
east to move and mow under if needed.
love these pens!

it's in my kitchen with all of my game of thrones memorabilia.
perfect addition.
i've dropped my phone multiple times on concrete and asphalt and this case has done a great job of protecting my phone.
there's no need to spend a lot of $$$ on fancier name-brands when this inexpensive and pretty case does just as good a job.
i've received many compliments on my pretty case.
"it was for him, so all i can say if i got it for him for xmas and asked him if he liked it, he said yes."
i said how many stars would you give it?
he said 5.
so it was a good present.
normally he doesn't like my presents
:)
"i think it looks good on him, too!"
"if i remember correctly, though, they run a tad small."
my husband is a l/xl and we had to return and then order an xxl to get him a size that would fit.
"this iphone 6s cover is a very good product.good quality, good material, very thin but seems very useful.the color and the touch feeling is very high quality."

very nice amp.
"it does require some burn in time, so give it at least a week of fairly regular use before passing any judgment."
"the accessories could have been better quality, but for the money and overall performance/ease of use i am giving it five stars."
my 3 year old grandson (who has small feet for his age) totally loved these socks.  
"the socks are quality and of a nice weight, but do run a bit small as they barely fit him."
bought this for left over dinner that i bring to lunch for work.
"sometimes, i don’t want to bring a lunch box."
it is sturdy and did not leak even if my food has some sauce on it.
great product!

"made of a soft, microfiber-like fabric."
"unsure exactly what kind of materials there are since there is no tag attached, but it's well-stuffed (ba dum tss)."

i see a high potential for use as christmas gifts.
this dress has a silhouette that is so flattering.  
"the deep navy blue borders the barely off white and around your face, ""belts"""
"your waist making it appear smaller, and the front of the skirt in a natural tan is very effective, professional and sexy.  "
the neck is a higher cut round.  
i have  a large bust and
the ponte knit zips me in and gives me that perfect hourglass shape we all covet so much.  
i am putting this with navy patent leather heels for sex appeal and just the right jewelry.  
you will love it too!

very nice & elegant wallet case.
"i am in love with it, the color is very pretty for pink."

smaller(which is not a bad thing)

you will never want to install markers again without using this drill bit!
its so easy to use...side ways!
love them perfect size thank you
very cute and soft!
easy to attach
/detach with the velcro.
these are a bit loose due to the velcro placement on the car seat straps - so i don't use them all the time - great for a long car ride if kept in place on child.
better with less clothing layers on child.
also good for my child's bouncy jumper -
no chafing from those straps thanks to these!

customer service is very good too!
great product even better seller!
brown dog has gone above and beyond to make sure i got my product wish i could give more stars!

worked really well for a old family bassinet.  
it is cotton and
the baby is going to lay in the liner part
so you have to wash it in dreft
so be prepared to iron it.  
fits perfect though.
i love these fr my cloth diapering and prefer using this one handed contraption instead of pins on my baby
gift for our son
and he loved it!!  
fit perfect!
item was exactly as expected.
very nice product
i wish i had ordered the toddler size instead my baby's grown more since the last time i ordered some.
great for the price
"very protective, safe for my phone!"
great door mat!  
very well made!
i read reviews for this product on other websites and they said that it ran small.
i didn't have this problem at all.
i have a 24 inch waist and the small fit perfectly.
i love these a lot
and i really recommend them.
very pretty necklace for a very reasonable price.
"plus the two shades, rose gold and silver-"
you can wear with any thing!
i love it!
love it!!!!
good case!
cheap and convenient.
perfect to hold a card or two.
quality and inexpensive.
just as advertised
great gift.
"works great easy to install the drives, have two one of each kind of drive  and both installed easily"
bought this case for my daughter and she loves it!
fast shipping and perfect birthday present for my sock loving daughter!i
think i want a pair now!
great!would purchase again
it's a great gi.
i love the stitching and that's
it's fit for a woman's shape.
i did return it because it's not made for this woman's shape.
not for wide hips or blessed bust.
but does have the smaller waist and shorter slim legs & perfect arm length.
i think the brand just runs on the smaller side because i have another brand that fits well.
this vinyl letter is beautiful and goes so well with our harry potter theme living room.
i wish it was a little bigger
but it fits very nicely in it's spot.
i love it thanks!
"very good product, very good built,perfect to improve my bjj grip,thank you"
i'm very pleased with the product.
"they're good sized, heavy duty and will be in use for a long time."
i love it!!  
beautiful print and soft fabric
yes right size and good quality
"the case came in a nice package which included 2 screen protectors, a leather case and a little piece of cloth."
little cloth was pretty useful.
i used it to wipe the screen before i put the screen protector on.
the case itself was easy to snap on.
it is very soft to touch.
the only downside is a strong smell of the materials used.
i can deal with a leather smell but there is more to just a leather smell.
i can smell it on my fingers after i touch my phone.
overall i'm satisfied with the purchase.
very nice.
beautiful cover

every single one of the plants is growing - they are great!

"the no-name ""portable cordless led eye..."" lamp, provided by vendor at a serious discount as a 'for review' item is good enough and pretty enough to deserve its own brand name"
and i am wondering what's keeping the makers from doing so.
but i'm not 'marketing'.
"in fact, my mission is to help anyone looking for 'something' cut through the marketing fog and help them make a better informed decision."
"so, this is what i've learned by testing and playing around with the no-name lamp."
wowlet me start with the 'wow factor' because when it comes to lamps one of my main criteria happens to be 'looks'.
and the lamp not only looks 'good' bordering on 'amazingly good'
"if you appreciate the clean, streamlined design style, it looks different from everything else, as far as i know"
so it gets good grades on daring to be different.
"as the amazon page pics show, you can unbend the lamp to make it into an almost straight stick or baton that lies flat on the desk."
"or you can bend it for the light arm to hover almost parallel to your work surface, perhaps allowing you to read or examine something there without necessarily interfering with the computer monitor in front of you."
"and then there are other ways in which you may want to use it, such as find an interesting way to bend it so that it can somehow hang somewhere which is what makes it interesting, because someone may find ways to use it that no one else has before."
just make sure that you don't twist it and you don't bend it to more than an 25-degree angle because it could break if you do.
"the lamp is small enough, light enough and flexible enough to allow for a lot of freedom in using it."
finish is a finger-proof rubbery material that covers the base and the bendable area and a brushed metal texture on the section that hosts the led lights.
"the lamp is about 1/2 inch on the base at its thickest, decreasing gradually to about 1/4 inch at the opposite end with width from 2.5 inches at the base and decreasing to a little under 2 inches at the opposite end."
"on, and i need to say something about packaging because if you want to make this into a gift, you don't need to worry."
"the boxing is truly 'high end', the lamp coming with a hard cardboard 'optometer' wrapped around it, keeping itself closed though some magnetic clasp."
it should make a good impression and contribute to the 'wow' factor.
outputthe vendor claims '18 brightness levels' in the product name and then '18 unique settings' in the product description.
the latter comes closer to the truth.
"there are exactly 6 brightness levels which, when combined with the 3 color temperature settings (5400k whitish-cold, 3100k yellowish-warm and 4200k in-between neutral) would give you the 18 settings but not necessarily 18 brightness levels."
"well, the lamp does not allow you to control temperature and brightness on an 'infinite' scale the way some very high end products do but these 18 settings are a pretty good compromise to me making this relatively inexpensive product in many ways"
the gateway drug that would switch one someone's taste for truly excellent lighting implements.
the brightness in its highest setting is by no means blinding
but that's okay because this is meant to be mostly a reading lamp.
"at the lowest, it could be made into a night light and the 2000mah battery seems to be sufficient for the lamp to keep going overnight."
the amazon page claims up to 40 hours of continuous light but
"the specs as found in the little product manual say 3-30 hrs, depending on brightness."
"well... it you keep the lights low, it does last overnight on its own - not connected to a power source."
operationthe lamp is charged through a standard usb cable which is provided.
there is a usb mini port on one side.
there is no charger but any standard usb charging device or even your own computer can do it.
the manual states that it should fully charge in 2-3 hours and i confirm that this is the case.
"of course, it will operate independently for as long as there is some juice in the battery"
and there is a small blue led light that will tell you that you need to recharge by blinking.
the controls are quite simple.
"there is touch on/off power button, a touch button that lets you switch between the 3 available color temperature modes and an array of six brightness control buttons that sit next to each other and allow you to control brightness by either touching one specific button or by simply sliding your finger left/"
right on the array.
and that's it.
"besides controlling brightness and temperature, as i stated, you have the ability to control lamp's shape by bending it to the preferred angle."
"my ratingthis no-name lamp could easily become my favorite if my environment's had a high-tech, minimalist, futuristic, industrial quality."
it should also look good on a student's desk in a dorm because it takes so little space and
yet it looks so cool.
"perhaps it's not fully into the 'high end, amazing' league mostly because of the limited rather than 'infinite' choices for color temps and brightness and because the rubbery finish end is not so easy to maintain and keep pristine"
but it comes so close and the current price is very fair for what you get in design and functionality in my view.
"i would hope that the makers would do 2 things: give this lamp a name and, maybe, think of launching a true high-end version if what they have now turns out to be successful."
i absolutely love how thin this case it but still offers protection from minor bumps and scratches.  
it allows you to still see the exquisite design of the iphone without leaving any areas of the iphone case vulnerable to scratches.  
i can easily access all of my buttons and ports without issue.  
it is flexible.  
i attached a photo below of me bending the case slightly.
it is very easy to put on and remove from my iphone.  
"if you like slim fit cases, this is definitely the one for you.  "
it is very lightweight and doesn't add any bulk to the device.
"if i could find anything wrong with it, i would just like something for the front side of the phone and the screen."
"other than that, it is a great product to protect from scratches."
my momma always told me to tell the truth or otherwise i'd get in trouble.  
"even though i got this at a discount, i always follow my mom's rule.  "
tell the truth.  
this review is my honest opinion.
it's really pretty!
"i like the design in the back, even though not all the ""diamante"" were centered where they are supposed to be."
"three are off by a bit, but it's still a very nice looking case."
"the case is very slim, and doesn't offer too much drop protection, but works great for scratch protection and light drops."
"the front doesn't have much of a lip either, so it barely is past the glass if you're worried about putting your phone face down, this isn't the case for you."
"we have a tempered glass protector, and don't care, but the tempered glass touches if you put the phone face down with this case."
"it fits perfectly, easy to put on & take off."
the cutouts and button covers line up perfectly and the cutouts are a good size for normal chargers and cell phone headphones.one of the best things you can do for your device / phone that will increase their longevity and functionality is to provide it with sufficient protection against the potential damages it sustains when being handled.

"there are not any dislikes i have about this product; if i notice anything strange or unusual about this product after using it overtime, i will make sure to update this review and make the necessary changes that i see fit."
"about me, as a reviewer - i am hardcore researcher."
i am always looking for stuff
"i am an engineer myself, with a background in medicine too."
i studied electrical engineering at an ivy tier school along with biomedical engineering.
my dad is a quality engineer and wife a doctor.
so i know a lot about many things.
these guys have pretty good attention to detail and a lot of thought.
"i usually by very top notch stuff, after hours of research."
"yet even after that, sometimes, stuff does not give great outcomes."
i have seen a huge variance with companies when that happens.
my ratings explanation: i realize that the 1-5 star rating is to help both buyers and sellers.
thus when i rate something the number of stars is just my opinion on how i feel about the product.
"if i give something a 5 star rating that means that i truly love that product and it has features that put it above and beyond what would normally be expected, and it is something that “wowed” me"
and i truly am glad i have.
"for instance, i have given some items such as watches 5 star ratings and some only 4 stars."
i have given things i have purchased for my daughters 5 star ratings because they love the product and based on their input
i feel it deserves 5 stars.
"items with 4 star ratings are items that do exactly as i would expect, but do not stand out significantly in any way."
if an item gets a 3 star rating that is because my feeling about the product is neutral.
i do not consider that a negative it is just that it didn't
“wow” me.
some things i have given 3 star ratings are items like household cleaners or paper towels.
"some items have received lower ratings because of the way they were made or put together, and it is getting that review because of quality."
very rarely will i give a 1 or 2 star rating unless the item is completely worthless and not worth the money and i am only giving that rating as a warning to others.
"this being said, i try to be as descriptive in my review as possible and will never give a bad rating to a product just to complain because the color of the item received was slightly different than shown on my computer screen, such as a shirt or shoes, or because i failed to really read the seller's description and disclaimers."
"in some instances, i have received items that were poorly packaged and the item was damaged, but an email to the seller always rectified the issue."
"when that happens, i fully disclose what happened and the outcome."
"i usually add photos to my reviews, but sometimes a photo is not necessary because of the item or because the description has better photos than i could provide."
"if my review was helpful, please select ""yes"" below."
"also, please feel free to send me any questions related to this product."
i will do my very best to answer them for you based on my experiences with the product.
i am an avid amazon shopper and i personally rely heavily on product reviews to determine which products i buy.
"because i know the importance of honest reviews, i give my opinion based solely on my personal experiences with the product."
"if you take a look at my review history, you will see that i tell it all - the good & the bad, regardless of discounts received."
i received this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and sincerely hope it has helped you make a better informed decision.

i just bought this case and it makes my iphone 6s plusslim and easy to handle while giving it great protection.
i actually bought a screen cover (for the first time ever) and it was bad
so i'm not going to use one.
my other phones all had perfect screens after at least 3 years of use
so i'm sure this will be the same.
but with this case i am pretty confident that this casual protect my phone even without a screen protecter on my phone.
now also the holster is also a great plus even if you don't uses it doubles as a kickstand.
"this has happened to me a couple of times, and you just need to not panic, read the message and then scroll to the normal boot option and select that."
this case is pretty amazing.
"at first, i was skeptical about the strength of the case before i put it on my phone, but after putting it on it feels a lot more protective than my previous case."
"i like the fact that it has a kickstand on the back of it, but it was pretty tough at first to open up"
and i was worried about breaking it.
"but, it did not break and is now much easier to open."
it works like a dream!
"but, it does seem slightly fragile at times."
i really enjoy the grip that this case offers.
"when holding the phone, it offers you slots to put your fingers on and they are smooth as well as grippy."
"i've never had this on another phone case, so"
i didn't know what i've been missing!the case also came with a belt holder for the phone when inside the case.
"this is very handy, and the case fits perfectly and does not feel as if it would fall out."
"i was also surprised to find that other cases will fit into this as well, but don't fit as snuggly."
"overall, this is an amazing case and fits perfectly on my phone."
i love it!

i also received this product at a discounted price for my absolute honest review.
i like the design of this case the most.
"it does protect the phone well enough, but the design is the best."
"it is like a robot over your phone or something, i love it."
"it gives a good cover all around the phone, and locks it in place nicely without any extra room left over."
fits nice and snug.
"the best part is my volume buttons still work, like they are supposed to."
"with most cases it covers up the volume buttons, and then you have to fight to use them or find yourself searching underneath rubber to find them, but i didn't have this problem with this case."
"the picture is accurate, but it looks a lot prettier when you get it over your phone, it still looks professional, and either a guy or a girl could use it, so my husband doesn't feel weird about holding or using my phone."
"i really like it, and overall the material is made with good quality, so i am happy."
"i received this product at a promotional rate in exchange for nothing but my honest review, and opinion."
"receiving this product at a promotional rate, in no way effects the quality or honest of my review, but is only intended to inform others of my personal experience with it."
thanks for reading.
the iphone is a very good looking phone and you shouldn't have to hide it behind a bulky and ugly case.
"this case provides the best of both worlds in that it is able to show off the back of the phone, retain a very slim design, and provide ample protection from drops."
"the case provides a very tight fit around the phone, which helps prevent the phone from slipping out of the case, protection from falls, and keeps a natural feel to the phone."
"i am a big fan of slim cases, and this case has the slimmest feel compared to the others i’ve tried, it’s"
the closest feeling to a “naked” phone.
on the other hand it’s not too slim that it won’t provide fall protection.
i’ve had my phone slip multiple times and it’s resulted in zero damage to the phone.
"i have full confidence that the will give me enough protection from common slips out of pockets and lower drops, but a face down drop may result in a cracked phone."
"the case “lip” sits ever so slightly above the screen, so it will protect from scratches."
one of the biggest problems i’ve noticed and experienced with clear back cases is dirt and other particles getting trapped between the phone and the case.
this eventually results in ugly scratches and pitting on the back of the phone from the dirt rubbing against the phones shell.
"i was hoping it wouldn’t be an issue with this case, but only the finest lint and has made its ways between the phone and case"
and i have no worries of scratching due to the tight fit of the case around the phone.
if you want it to look nice you’ll have to regularly take the case off and clean the phone and clear case backing.
all the cutouts on the case are spot on and all ports are easily accessible.
"the volume buttons and power buttons are covered and slightly difficult to press originally, but break in after award."
"the vibrate button is exposed, but protected for easy flipping."
one thing that wasn’t there that is shown in the stock photos is the duzhi logo on the side.
overall
: this has been my daily driver for about two weeks now
and i absolutely love it.
"it’s a good looking, slim case, that offers enough protection for day to day accidents while still appreciating the iphone’s attractive design."
go and grab one for yourself!

wotmic iphone 6
"plus shockproof scratch proof dual layer soft silicone and pc compact casegreat protective case, not so thin but not too bulky"
", it for sure will do the job of protecting the phone from a tough fall, i love the corners, they have extra silicone protection and the hard case fits perfectly well, the phone will also be protected from scratching your screen when setting it upside-down on a surface."
"the dual layer is great when inserting the phone, the silicon is soft and will also protect your phone from scratching it when inserting the hard case."
"the volume and power buttons are well protected and the cuts from the bottom are well cut and aligned, allowing a clean access to the headphone jack and the lighting connector."
this is a great choice for a good protection.
is my review helpful?
please let me know by selecting yes in the help pull button below!i received this product either for free or at a discounted price by the seller of the product.
regardless of the fact that i received the product for free or at a discounted price let it be known that it in no way influenced my honest review.
"i only write honest and unbiased complete reviews regardless of whether i purchased a product at full price, purchased the product at a discounted price, or received the product from the seller for free."
"great fishing kayak, not much compares for the price."
at 14+ ft long i was unsure if i would enjoy it as both a fresh and salt water fishing platform.
the width is also narrow for speed
however i was able to stand and cast in calm conditions.
because of the awesome storage options fly casting does get a little complicated with your line having more things to hook onto.
if your looking for fly fishing only i would not recommend
however i was able to fly fish landing the extra line mostly in my lap.
"i did really enjoy using the rudder to adjust direction as the wind pushed me, this is very effective while fly fishing windy lakes as you do not want to constantly have to pick up your paddle."
trolling on the ocean is where this kayak really shines.
"while it has length and is narrow it is amazingly stable in rough conditions,"
"no issues moving about to gain access to gear while sitting side saddle, feet in the water."
"this kayak is efficient at reaching long paddle locations quickly, you will leave your hobie friends behind with a decent paddle."
the fish finder pod is also great
", i recommend you tube to see why."
i couldn't be happier with the abundance of gear options and locations to mount poles or whatever else
you desire such as cameras for your bragging rights.
"not a purchase i will regret in any way, this is one i will keep till it breaks."
"disclaimer!i was sent this case to review, just because this was sent to me doesn't change my review."
this is 100%
"my opinion!this case is so cute, i love polar bears"
so i obviously am obsessed with this case!
it is very slim and super comfortable to hold on to.
all the cut outs are perfectly in the right spots.
it is like ombré from the bottom to middle the the top.
"it is dark blue at the bottom, light blue in the middle, and clear on the top just as in the photo."
it fits perfectly.
"it is a gel, bendy material."
the water on the polar bear is a little green though
but that's only because of the white.
"the polar bear and the water feels kind of matte, which i love because it's easier to hold on to than it would be if it was just glossy."
"if you're looking for a case that is super cute and sturdy, you want this one."
it doesn't feel like there is anything on my phone at all.
i have the silver iphone
"so it looks cuter, but would look adorable with any colored phone."
i would definitely recommend this to anyone!
🙂
this is a super affordable case that provides superior protection.
"when they say ""shockproof"""
"they mean ""shockproof""!"
"fortunately i have never cracked my iphone screen, knock on wood."
i am not one of those people that can not have a case on their phone as i am quite clumsy.
another wonderful feature of this case is that its incredibly slim and clear so your are not covering up the beautiful design of your iphone.
"what i specifically look for that ""front lip"" in a phone case to protect the glass screen from the occasional face down drop of my phone and"
i am pleased with the front bumper that this case has.
i received this product at a slight discount in exchange for my honest review.
i feel so fab in these!
i got the blue lenses and they are super reflective.
my face is pretty small and these are definitely big sunglasses
but they aren't so big that they look silly
(
or so i think)
:)
they aren't flimsy and don't bend that easily which is great because if you are the kind of person that throws sunglasses in your bag
then they won't get too destroyed.
i keep them in the pouch that it comes with so that the lenses don't get scratched though.
"i love cat eye sunglasses, i think it really lifts your face up and makes your cheeks look sharp!"
these are really fun shades.
i would highly recommend!
i was lucky enough to receive these sunglasses at a small discount in exchange for my honest review.
disclaimer:
i recieved this product free
or
at a discounted price.
this is my 100% honest and unbiased opinion..
"received my iphone 6 case, case has a nice style, quality seems decent & durable and has a nice feel in hand and will not stick putting in/out of pocket.pretty simple to install & remove."
"im sold on this case for the time being, and can highly recommend it for the quality, size, protection and price."
"i love the jelly like feel, and it came in a waterproof bag which was convenient."
i did a lot of searching and read reviews and made the right decision with this case.
thank you.
these are uncomfortably minty.
i once took two of these at once.
i immediately passed out.
"two days later, i found a small brood of penguins roosting in my mouth."
"if you have a tinder date in .03 seconds, and you've been eating trash straight out of the dumpster like some sort of human-racoon hybrid, you can take one of these and your breath will smell like narnia."
i love these!
"easy to clean, open and close slider."
i use for my lunch every day and great to place left overs in.
"also if you didn't notice at first, these have measurements on the side of each bag to help you when measuring portions."
so super great!!!
"this is a mature title, and i don't know if everyone understands that."
the story in this game touches on very adult subjects.
besides that this is a great hack and slash/platformer game.
i highly recommend this game if you have an xbox 360.
choosing a smartphone case is not getting any easier.
the number of options is overwhelming.
my criteria was this:1
- i want something light.
apple goes out of the way in making these lightweight compact beauties and having a heavy(er) case
defeats the purpose.2 -
"i want something discreet, that is just a personal preference."
nothing wrong with fluorescent green cases if that is your inclination.
just not for me.3
- i like this metallic look
apple products have.
i was very particular to a transparent case.4
- i wanted a case with a very snug fit.
in the past poorly fitting cases required that i clean them often.
the veil did all of the above.
i received this product with a promotional discountfor
my personal review that is 100% my own opinion.
hopefully it will be of some useto you while choosing among competing products.
i received no compensation for this.
iam not required to give a positive review and you will see both positive and negativereviews on my profile.
my lifetime average review is 3.5 stars and that reflects inpart the fact that i screen out junk products.

thank you!!
this veil iphone case is exactly what i was looking for!
"its slim and keeps the thin design feel of the iphone, and because of the clear case it shows the color of phone you have.  "
because whats the point of choosing the color of your phone when its hidden in a case.  
"the material protects all around the phone even the sides, and is pretty simple to remove.  "
the ports are cut perfectly so they are accessible.
the case doesn't feel cheap either.

exactly what you would want and expect for a phone case!
it arrived fast exactly as advertised.
i appreciate quality construction good fit and good value and even though i did receive some discount to review it
i would certainly recommend it to a friend or purchase it again.
this is adorable case that is exactly what you would get for four times more at a cell phone store and is a really good purchase for sure.
i got these shoes for my daughter.
she wore them on the fourth of july and was the center of attention
at
our cookout!
the fact that you can recharge them with a usb cord is sensible and convenient.
they also have a setting that make the lights change colors.
disclaimer  
i received this product free or discounted in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion.
this panty is very sexy and eye catching!
i would say to order a size larger than u are because the panties run small because they have the spandex/cotten and make your stomach flatter and firm the butt without flattening it!  
every woman must have a pair!!
men this is perfect gift for any sexy woman!
does exactly what it says it does.  
"i wanted to hook a new panasonic camcorder into my laptop to use for live webinars, and the camcorder only has hdmi out.  "
this is one of very few devices i found that can simply adapt hdmi to a streaming video usb port.  
"i got it fast, plugged the usb cord from the camcorder into the frame grabber, and then into the laptop.  "
"the laptop recognized it right away as a webcam (no drivers, install, or anything), and the video quality is excellent."
the moniko wallet case was a big hit with my wife!
high quality case of gorgeous leather makes the convenience it offers even better.
"no need to carry an arm full of stuff with you, as this case allows you to carry cash or cards securely and comfortably."
my wife loves it!!
this is a great case.
"i like the way it holds the phone securely and the pockets for pictures, money or credit cards is enough to be able to not have to carry my purse when making a quick run to the store."
the wrist band makes this phone wallet one that my crew gives a thumbs up.
promotional or discounted product provided for review.
"this game is probably one of the best i have ever played on 360, artwork is stunning, the different styles of game within the game are unusual and entertaining, its a very large game and actually pretty difficult."
if you like a tomb raider style of game or platform genre you'll love this game!
this was definitely a surprise find for me.
very good projector for it's size.
i bought this projector because i needed something portable and still bright enough to take around with me when i go to different places and give presentations and was very impressed by this!
it works great for a presentation for a group of about 10 people but we still needed to close the curtain and dim the lighting.
it was easy to set up my iphone6plus with it with wifi
and i've had no problems with it so far.
definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking for a projector that's easy to carry around but still bright enough to be professional.
wow!
i used to have rogue’s fat boy sled and thought it was good until i bought iron bull’s speed sled.
this is all you need for a sled in terms of robust design and stability for pulling heavy weights.
the design is flawless.
very pleased with this item!
mine has been working like a champ.
keep a set of spare elbow connections.
the only way to go in dwc.

"what a beautiful phone case for an iphone 6, its sleek design is very forward to which i'm very pleased with its visual design.  "
the case itself offers a very good quality rubber insole and a harder outside case.
"i love how the lil faux diamonds on the case bling in the sun light, very fancy.  "
the openings on the case fit perfectly.  
"i was able to plug and unplug devices (i.e. headphones, etc) into the device and the camera also worked perfectly."
in all this is a very brilliantly designed case and i'm very happy with it!  
definitely recommend.  
i received this product at a promotional price.
my review contains my own honest experiences with the product.
i’ve been using this mostly as a decoration lamp in my living room.
it has different colors and you can pick whatever you want.
very cute!
"the shape of the lamp is really interesting, kind of oval on the bottom and it fits perfectly on the piece of wood that goes in the bottom."
very cool!
damn!
this is a beautiful piece and the price is unbelievably low
looked all over for 4x6 printable magnets...hard to find.  
these were perfect!  
"a bit pricey, but about what you'd expect.  "
we printed some baby announcements on these and they turned out beautiful!  
light enough to mail with a regular stamp!
i 💘 my case
its so 😍 & does the job...
it looks 👌.....
exactly like the pic...
i would recommend other to support this 💎 if your in need for a case/anything.....
my's is  truly protected.......thank you
this is the best gag doormat.
great quality and heavy.
my mail man is a big trumpy and now hates me.
lol ..
"though, hes not to crazy"
we both had a good laugh.
i personally enjoy wiping my boots on this mat when its rainy outside.
i was looking for new earbuds for my 16 year old son.  
i was sick of disposable earbuds; i've thrown so many away that have bad cords.  
so i searched on amazon for earbuds with a nylon cord.  
"we had gotten a auxiliary cord a few years ago that was wrapped with braided nylon and it has proved to be much more durable than previous cords,"
hence the search for tougher earbuds.  
we've had them for a few weeks so long term durability has yet to be determined
but so far they are working great.
"but on the plus side, i borrowed these from my son a few days ago to listen to a you tube infomercial without disturbing my husband.  "
i was totally blown away!  
"i thought i was listening to stereo theater sound, surround sound, thx, dolby digital, whatever you call it.  "
i wonder what it would be like if i actually listened to music...  
"i read tons of reviews to decide to purchase these, and considering the crap earbuds we last bought from t*t for $18 that didn't even last a week, i consider this as $25 well spent.  "
my son has worn these with his ipod while running and had no complaints that i know of.  
"if i have any further feedback, i will try to post a later update, especially on durability."
"personal rant, feel free to skip:  unlike many reviewers, i did not get these free or for any kind of discount.  "
"seriously, how do you get into that racket?  "
i would love to get free or cheap stuff
"but i have to say that i tend to not take those reviews very seriously, especially when they are all the first listed reviews.  "
"i research pretty much everything i buy, both because i want value for my money, but also because i don't want to contribute any more than necessary to the landfills and the disposable mentality.  "
and i've been discouraged by the high number of products i've run across that look like they are buying their positive feedback.  
"anyway, i feel i haven't done enough to post my own product evaluations,"
so cheers
", here's to doing my part. :)"
update(12/08/2016)
:  
the beloved earbuds have finally gone kaput after over two years of excellent service.
"if earbud years are like cat or dog years, that makes them about 150 years old.  "
"the have had plenty of wear and tear and their final demise was due to the wood cracking...(possibly being stepped on, sat on, shut in a car door..."
(who knows with a teenager)  
"in any case, i am enthusiastically planning to buy another pair for each of my sons."
these do sound great and they are aesthetically very pretty.
"however i've had them in for less than an hour and my ears are already aching because even though i have the smallest rubber piece on the bud, the wooden part is so big in circumference that it stretches my ears and hurts big time."
i guess this is how they get the major sound cancellation
but it needs to be a soft material that can form to your ear.
the wood is obviously not pliable and after awhile of having these in your ear they ache.
"i consider myself to have average adult female sized ears, never had this problem before."
probably have to return these unfortunately.
i have had these earbuds for a little under a year and have really enjoyed them the entire time.
"they produce good quality sound and do a decent job of muffling noise, to the extent that i no longer bring my larger over-ear, noise cancelling headphones."
"i have really enjoyed the ability to pause my music/podcast with the button on the cord, and the clip to attach them to your shirt works great as well."
what is really outstanding is the customer service.
i called in today because the glue holding one of the headphones together had come apart and the headphone no longer worked.
"luckily i was within the 1 year warranty, and within 5 minutes, they had verified the problem, confirmed my original order, and sent a new pair of headphones to my new address."
i would highly recommend products from symphonized because of this alone.
these are just ok.
con:
i was expecting the cord to be far less rigid...
i have used these for two days and the cord is still in the same basic shape that it shipped in.  
not a great look.  
"the ""carry bag"" is so thin you can see through it..."
and it's twice the size it needs to be.
"pro:the sound is decent, a little more bass heavy than i was expecting based on the other reviews saying they are ""flat"", but overall pleasant."
"other thoughts: i would consider trying the nrg 1.0 which has just the cloth cable (no thick plastic ""shell"" around the cloth jacket) or the nrg 3.0 which is just a typical silicone/rubber jacket.  "
"the packaging is just comically bad, especially for a company that has such a nice website.  "
"looks like dollar store packaging, with god-awful flame artwork printed on a home color laser printer.  "
these are probably nice $15 earbuds...
"for $25 at the time of this writing, i can not recommend these.  "
"i would pay $25 if they could make a premium cloth jacketed cable (like a nice guitar patch cable), and provide a decent (maybe even wood ;) ) carry case."
they worked very well for me.  
blocked out all the noise around me and the sounds that came through
was great.  
i also really like the look of them.  
"however, before my warranty was up, the toggle broke.  "
i emailed the company through amazon marketplace and initially thought i was going to be taken care of.  
"they said they were ""more than happy to assist (me) with a replacement for these headphones,"" after i confirmed my order id and address.  "
but it seems that wasn't the case.
"i had also ordered another pair of these headphones, but they weren't as great, and i left a review that reflected so.  "
the symphonized team included in their email (about my replacement headphones i had initially inquired about) that they wanted me to possibly consider updating my previous review.  
"when i said that the issue i had with the other pair of headphones was still an issue, they replied again and asked once more for me to update my review ""at very least, for our customer service."
"""now"
"i am past my warranty, out of headphones and frustrated."
the sound is good for the price.
"however, i've bought some version of these headphones three times because the problem is that ultimately, the the forward wood section becomes unglued from the back half."
i would squeeze it back on and it would come loose again.
"i'd cut up tiny pieces of a paper towel and place it on the rim, hoping that the bulk would create enough pressure to keep it in place.  "
that would work for a while and
"then... eventually, the tiny wires would rip off... into the garbage can."
"with this last pair, i applied a moistened q-tip to the rim, and then applied tiny amounts of gorilla glue.  "
then i kept them secure with a held on with a bar clamp (very slight pressure) for 24 hours.  
that finally seemed to work.
best sounding buds i have found.  
it is rare that an item in this price range impresses me as much as these being equal to and going beyond my expectations.
i returned a set of bluetooth buds which for all the hype were terrible and decided to go corded
and i could not be more happy.  
i call myself a wanna be audiophile in
that my budget does not let me be a true one.
first impression is that they are simply beautiful and appear beyond the price point.  
the sound is amazing regardless of size or price.  
"i listened to several different genre's from classical, chill, blues, new age to epic and all sounded great.  "
base is there without sounding amplified and  all sounds feel layered with vocal appearing to be in the for front.  
listening to instrumental all they all sounded as they would be placed in an orchestra.
just wish the case were a little larger making it more easy to put the buds back in.
don't know what more i can say but
to just get them
and you will not be disappointed.
i love these earbuds!!
my 12 yr old daughter is an earbud killer.
i can't even tell you how many i've purchased for her that have broken!
i bought these after reading reviews for her.
the first set needed to be replaced because the mic came apart.
she could still use the buds
but i didn't like her using them with exposed wires.
the company sent us a replacement quickly and without a fuss.
now she's been using them for months and they still work!!
hooray!
"i lost a previous pair of these symphonized earbuds, and decided to buy them again because the sound quality is quite good at the price, and the price is very reasonable.  "
"no i don't think the wood has anything to do with the sound quality, but i have used many over the years including from shure, ue, klipsch, v-moda, etc.  "
i have learned to avoid expensive earbuds because i always eventually lose them or rip the cord
or they just stop working
", so i try to buy ""good enough"" earbuds and keep a reserve set of nicer over the ear phones for quality listening.  "
"which is not to say these don't sound good, they do, so why pay more?  "
"of course, a good seal is necessary for bass, and i do have a little trouble with these tips staying in.  "
"as with most brands you get three sizes but two sets, one clear one black.  "
my favorite silicone tips were always with the v-moda headphones
"but they decided to stop making them and seem to just be focused on more expensive high end equipment, unfortunately.  "
but everybody's ears are different.
the controller works great but there is only one button so no volume control for iphone.  
i wish more earbuds would use three buttons.  
i considered the 3.0 version for my replacement set but stuck with the 2.0 because i really like the cable
and i wasn't sure i liked the cable on the 3.0.  
"the cable is flashy and attractive regardless of color, and coated in plastic so it doesn't have the rubbery feel and makes it a little easier to untangle the cord because there's less friction."

"*update october 28, 2016**************************************separated at silver band on left bud.  "
"though the sound was nice, almost comparable to the high-end stuff, a pair of buds that last for roughly 6 months for $25?  "
i suppose you get what you pay for.  
save your nickels and get a pair of bose if you're looking for a pair of buds to see you through the long haul.  
"otherwise, these are only short-term buds."
snazzy looking earbuds with a great selection of tips included.  
"physically, they appear sturdy (except for those photographs one reviewer posted where there's separation around the aluminum ring) and are aesthetically pleasing.  "
"but for the real reason why i bought them, the sound quality.  "
"while i wouldn't lay claim to these being the best earbuds i've ever owned, they are certainly an upgrade over any stock ones that come with a phone, device, or gadget.  "
i ran them through a variety of scenarios.  
"firstly, my tablet.  "
sound is a massive upgrade over the stock speaker built into the tablet.  
"i play marvel's contest of champions a lot on my tablet, and while testing these out, i heard a lot more nuanced sound effects in the game ("
"the quinjet landing on the roof of the avengers tower stage, the raindrops in the savage land stage).  "
i played a few sound effect-heavy clips on youtube next.  
"civil war, doctor strange and dawn of justice all sound tenfold better than the stock speaker, highs are noticeably clearer and bass has punch and doesn't sound like my pug farting.  "
"next, i streamed some tunes.  "
here's where i was...underwhelmed.  
"music sounded clear, bass responsive, but nothing that would rock your body like bose or sennheisers.  "
"the songs i played, were the following:  oasis - champagne supernova, notorious b.i.g - juicy, linkin park"
"- my december (reanimation version), chemical brothers - block rockin' beats, and the marvelite in me couldn't resist hooked on a feeling - blue swede (1973!!"
that song belongs to meeee!!!!).  
"crappy music taste aside, i felt it was a fair representation of music for the afternoon.  "
"unfortunately, i haven't listened to any of my solo piano stuff to gauge that.  "
"again, each song sounded better than the stock tablet speaker, or some bluetooth speakers i've heard, but not on the level of the premium earbuds.  "
but let's be realistic here
": these are $26 earbuds, folks.  "
"you can't expect them to sound like bose, sennheiser or audio technica.  "
that's unreasonably absurd.  
"for $26 earbuds, they look cool as hell, sound great, and certainly worth the money.  "
"for the price point, i doubt you'll hear better.  "
i always critique a product with one question in mind: would i give these to a friend?  
"the answer here is yes, unquestionably.  "
i intend to use these until they've either fallen in the toilet
"(things happen, okay), or get mistaken for food by my pug (he's fat and happy).  "
"accordingly, they're worth 4 stars.  "
"i'd give 4 1/2 if i was able to, but in this instance, i'm rounding down.  "
exceptional product for the price point (both technically and aesthetically).  
hope this helps.
these do sound great and they are aesthetically very pretty.
"however i've had them in for less than an hour and my ears are already aching because even though i have the smallest rubber piece on the bud, the wooden part is so big in circumference that it stretches my ears and hurts big time."
i guess this is how they get the major sound cancellation
but it needs to be a soft material that can form to your ear.
the wood is obviously not pliable and after awhile of having these in your ear they ache.
"i consider myself to have average adult female sized ears, never had this problem before."
probably have to return these unfortunately.
i saw enough positive islands in this sea of mixed reviews that i thought i could give it a shot.
but i was sorrily disappointed by this product's radically flawed design.
"as a buyer, i was motivated by durability and time."
prime failed me regarding time because they shipped it usps
(i did not show prime *
ever* shipped usps) and that particular service is the sole service that at my apartment complex is not delivered to my door but to an office that adds an extra day (or an extra 3 in the case of american labor day weekend) to the shipping/receiving process.
"i suppose i can't blame prime for not knowing that, because of the policies of my dwelling, 2 day shipping would turn into 5 just by shipping it through the post office."
if only the product impressed me enough to make up for this.
"i suspect the product is as durable as it claims to be, but the ear buds do not stay in the ears at all, no matter which caps you apply from among the many they do to their credit provide."
"the buds are too long to fit in human ears, or they are the wrong shape."
"in any cheap pair of earbuds i have owned, you can let the cord hang down and give it a light tug and the weight will pull the buds straight downward snug into the lower cavity of your lobes."
"if you try that with these, they will flop out the sides of your ears and fall to the ground."
"if you so much as walk a three feet, or move your shoulders too suddenly, or some pretty italian lady is fanning the bed sheets behind you while she ever so gracefully makes your bed behind you, causing a mild breeze --- they will flop out the sides of your ears, and fall to the ground."
"i am only giving it two stars instead of one, because i enjoy that they are made of wood, and i have got a lot more reading done by not having earbuds in over a week."
really disappointed!
i so badly wanted to love these.
they're very nice looking earphones but after a couple of months the metal part connected to the wooden body came apart--
and i was taking good care of these earphones.
i solved that problem by supergluing it back together.
all was good.
"now, 8 months later, the left earphone began having a strange rattling sound, as if a component inside of the wooden body detached and was just rattling about."
today there is no sound at all coming out of the left ear...
great.
"i bought these hoping that they would last longer than the usual $8 earphones i've gotten in the past but jokes on me, they lasted just the same and cost more than twice as much!"
super disappointing.
i was originally skeptical about these earbuds
but happy that i was proven wrong in my skepticism.
for $25.99 these buds have a quality that of a pair that would go for triple the price.
they are very comfortable even on long walks.
the noise isolation is phenomenal; you don't hear anything but your music.
i even heard small details in some songs that i've been listening to for a while now.
such as light taps of drums or all the instruments in a rock song.
i was so impressed with these earbuds that i bought a second pair in gold for my mother for christmas.
"one word of advice, the cord makes a rubbing noise while you are in motion."
there is a very simple solution to this problem.
simply wrap the wires around your ears and the rubbing noise is greatly reduced to nothing.
"invest in these wooden earbuds today, you won't be disappointed."
"i got these to listen to music while at work, and they are amazing - the quality is fantastic!"
"i mostly listen to classical music, punk rock, classic rock, and podcasts."
these have had better quality than any other headphones i have tried for all of them.
i also have small ears and find many headphones very uncomfortable.
"these ones, along with skull candy, are the only ones that are truly comfortable (after i switched to the smallest size earbud cover, which comes with the earbuds)."
"they also come in a nice little decorative bag, so it's great for storing the earbuds before tossing them in my pocket or purse."
"i enjoyed them so much that when i decided to finally get a new pair of bluetooth earbuds as well, i chose the bluetooth ones by this brand even though they were pretty new and only had about 8 reviews at the time i purchased them - and i loved them as well.  "
high quality
", really nice look, i'm a happy customer!"
for the price these headphones are great.
i love the wood color and i also love the braided cord!
"however it can still get tangled up if you roll it up all the time, but much better than traditional headphones."
the sound itself is sufficient for me.
i listen to a variety of music and it gets the job done.
"the ear buds are pretty comfy if you put on the right size, although one set did start slipping off at one point and i lost one side."
i've replaced it with the extras which was nice.
if you really set them into your ears it will cancel out noise pretty well in your environment.
the length is also perfect.
i really enjoy having the microphone
and i use it all the time when i have conference calls for work.
the click features are nice too.
i use the triple click to go back quite often or double click to skip a song all the time.
my only gripe with these headsets is that you can hear them scratching against your zippers if you are wearing a jacket.
it's quite loud
and i'm not sure why it is that way.
it seems to be more amplified than it should be.
otherwise a great set of headphones.
these are a great value.
rich sound for earbuds
and i like the look and feel of them.
i bought them to replace another pair of symphonized earbuds that i've owned for almost 3 years.
"the old ones still work, but they got grimy and some of the nylon frayed after years of use."
these new ones seem sturdy and have an outer plastic coating which should prevent the fraying.
"the first pair i received had a defective button, but i contacted the company and they sent me a new pair in about one week."
the replacement works perfectly.
five stars for great customer service!
great sound and excellent comfort make these a very good purchase.  
i really like the noise isolating aspect due to the very comfortable fit and seal within my outer ear canal.  
the extra pairs of the different sized silicone material
ear pieces make proper fit very easy to accomplish; the silicone material being very very comfortable within my ears.
update:  
i remembered that i wanted to let others know that this is the second set of earbuds i bought.  
the reason i purchased these again was because of the balanced sound quality throughout the frequency spectrum.  
"they work very well for voice listening, such as with podcasts, streaming video, dvd movie listening, and of course most importantly, music!  "
"because they are very neutral across the entire frequency spectrum, they work exceedingly well with different equalizer configurations; they do not enhance any particular part of the frequency spectrum, thus making them great for changing eq settings for particular listen modalities, such as the ones i listed above.  "
"also, i did not buy the second set because my first broke or something like that; my first set are working great and my wife liked their sound a lot too.  "
so bought the second set for her as a christmas present.  
"she is very happy having her own pair, and now i don't have to share mine so much!"
update 12/4/2017: falling apart.
"i never really liked these headphones all that much, and now they are going in the trash."
i could glue them
i guess...
"but, meh."
update 12/18/2015:
customer support discovered that i had received 1.0 instead of the new 2.0 and sent a new pair for free.
i do not like these headphones at all.
"i was excited about the orange braided stylish cable, but that turned out to be the worst part."
"just touching the cable, or the cable rubbing on my shirt collar, caused sort of an reverb in my ear."
"hard to describe, but extremely distracting, could only listen to anything if i was sitting perfectly still,"
otherwise i could barely hear my books or music.
another issue too onmy
samsung note 4.
"with the audible app open, if i 'tap' anywhere on the cable, it causes the track to rewind 5 seconds or so."
"doesn't make any since, but after that i was done."
returned.
should note that the plain nrg 1.0 that i bought for my wife earlier in the year are fine.
"maybe it's just an nrg 2.0 issue, not sure, don't really care."
buying something else.
i loved these earphones but i will have to say thry need to up quality control on them
ive bought 3 pairs of theses over the cours of 3 years each one braking around the silver ring on them the adhesive they use
comes undone
fast the sound quality is
amazing thougth
"the ring adhesive has broke 3 times with 3 diffrent pairs  and on my latest pair that just broke a hour ago the headphone jack started acting up and made it that only one earbud played while the other sounded like a glichy mess along with the black peices on the wire coming loss and just hanging around on the wire, even if they brake in the same way each time i do love them but wont be able to get a new set"
pros:good bassgood midsgood highsdurable cord that does not tanglegood miccomes with a cute bagcons:
"eartips are not as comfortable as the 1.0's, it fits differently."
"cord makes a tiny bit of noise when rubbing, but this isn't an issue when listening to music."
i owned the nrg 1.0's for several months now
and i wanted to see the difference between that and the nrg 2.0's.
the clear difference is that the cord is covered with this rubber like plastic coating.
it's a bit glossy but it does not tangle
and it's durable.
my only complaint is that the cord does get annoying sticking out in odd angles (luckily a clip is included.)
"the style is still the samw, but this time around the microphone is now black instead of being the same color of the cord (1.0's,) and it works just the same."
"the sound is the same, though you are gonna have to use the earphones for a while to break-in earphones (the 1.0's have a better bass and highs, the 2.0's are a bit dull compared to them.)"
"the eartips are not as comfortable as the 1.0's because they have this little line, and it could irritate the ears."
"i gotta say i rate these a 8/10, they are good and will last you a while if you take care of them."
i'd recommend getting the 1.0's but the 2.0's doesn't fall too far behind.
good news/
bad news.
good news: these are very attractive earbuds
and they do an excellent job at canceling outside noise and the sound is great.
the bad news: the wood separated on the right earbud and the rubber end stayed in my ear as i unknowingly pulled it out thus severing the internal wires.
i'm bummed they only half way work.
i super glued the wood back together
so i least get noise cancellation on the right side.
i'm shopping around for something new...
update:
quickly received an inquiry from customer service after my first review.
new headphones were received a few days later.
i really love the sound and look of these earbuds and hope this pair outlives the first.
while the symphonized nrg
"2.0 headphones are good quality and the wooden style of the earpiece is pretty nice, the fact that i thought that these were braided headphones but actually not makes me give it a 4 star rating."
it is hard to find braided headphones anywhere nowadays.
i've been through 20+ pairs of different head phones and the only ones that lasted me for 5 years
were philips oneill specked.
"unfortunately, they are discontinued and the only oneill's are sold at $40"
+.
"hoped this would be a nice cheaper replacement, considering there is also built in microphone."
"hopefully, if the last me more than a year, it would be money worth spent, i think."
if they manage to last for 5 years like the oneill's - it would be a miracle.
i'm going to keep this simple.
i already gushed enough about the sound quality in my review of the first nrg buds.
so i'll only higlight the improvements made to the initial design.
"first off, the chord is now far sturdier and less likely to tangle as opposed to the cloth chord of the original."
the point where the chord connects to the buds has also been seemingly reinforced.
there is much less give as opposed to the first.
all in all
it is clear that symphonized listed to the concerns expressed with their first version.
the sound was never the issue and now the concerns over durability have been addressed as well.
"that said, i never personally had an issue and found the originals lasted for an acceptable length of time."
"basically, there are no better buds out there at this price point and even a little above."
"the sound is warm, but balanced and crystal clear and seeing as i wear these things for nearly 8 hours at a time without feeling any discomfort, they've nailed down comfortableness as well."
"all that was left was durability, but now they've got it covered."
"i'd like to say first off, in my opinion the sound quality of these is really good.  "
my dislikes involve the cord and the audio plug.  
the plug itself is designed poorly because it doesn't seem to fit flush when plugged in and comes out easily.  
the way that it's angled makes it easier for it to catch when slipping your phone/audio device into your pocket.  
"the cord is not very flexible, and when it is removed from the little pouch that it comes with, it coils and tangles easy.  "
the ear fit is okay
", they tend to slip out of my ears more often than i would like.  "
i bought these to replace some apple earpods.  
"i think these sound better, but with all of the other issues that i have, it just seems like more of a pain to use them unless i'm sitting perfectly still."
update:
"i have since used the symphonized nrg 3.0 and they are much better, improving on several of my issues with the 2.0.  "
you should check those out.  
i gave them 4 stars.
"i suppose it's impossible to have it all ... decent price, good sound quality, ear-fit and soft-pliable cord."
"the sound from the symphonized nrg 2.0 is fine, rich and full and the cost is acceptable -"
but then there's the other stuff ...
none of the provided sizes of
silicon buds fit ... too loose or just too uncomfortable -
and i've never had that problem
w/ other brands.  
and the cord sucks ....
it's stiff and springy and won't drape.
"just because of the cord i'm ditching the nrg 2.0... too bad, because the sound quality is pleasing."
revised 12/31/15since
my review
i've been in conversation
w/ symphonized customer support.
i really appreciate it when a company wants to discuss a customer's problem (real or otherwise).
"as stated, the sound quality of the nrg 2.0 is terrific - it is with the cord i had issues."
"when i first read the tech stuff on the 'buds i failed to grasp the significance of ""cable shield technology"" - that sounded like something a marketing department would dream up."
"now, however, i understand what those words mean - the nrg 2.0 is better suited when used in a active way - walking, jogging, at the gym, etc."
symphonized also has a basic nrg with a cable made of nylon
"- i think that better suits my requirements - which is sitting, reading and listening to music -"
"for that i don't need ""cable shield technology""."
i'm giving symphonized 2 thumbs up and a gold star for most excellent customer service!
i simply love these headphones.
i bought them last summer on sale for $15 and used them daily until the wood started to come apart at that metal band.
"no problem, just super glued it back together."
worked great...
and then i lost then.
i looked for months and finally gave up and ordered another pair.
no regret at all!
"they're not $150 earbuds, but they sound like earbuds three times their price!"
"the best value in earbuds!only con: the in-line control is only play/pause, no volume control."
"if you want that, go with the 3.0 version."
i stuck with these because i didn't mind that much
and i like the braided cable and gold color (both missing from the 3.0 line)
update12/8/2017:
originally would've rated these 5 stars!
i rated this set at three due to questionable durability.
i am raising due to exceptional customer service.
you can't beat the customer service of this company.
this is the second pair that they quickly jumped to get me a replacement set under their warranty replacement program.
"i still love many things about these headphone (sound great, good bass, noise cancelling, very comfortable and look cool)."
the price is very good for all these benefits.
"here's to hoping they last!i absolutely love the sound, noise canceling and comfort of these headphones."
i am at the poi t where i have to question their duarability.
my first pair lasted a few mo the and the wood separated leaving bare wires to be easily damaged.
my second pair didn’t fair much better.
after a few months the same.
i contacted customer support and they quickly sent a replacement pair.
while i waited i bought a 4th pair to have on standby
(i use headphones all day long).
it’s only been several weeks and my replacement pair now has become intermittent on one side.
i’m on to my 4th in about a years time.
i’m not
so sure i buy anymore
"... they sound great, but don’t seem to last long."
"the headphones are ok,"
honestly i dont feel a diff between this and the $3 bubble whatever headphones you purchase from walmart.
"the earpads or whatever is the name does not stay put inside the ear, it constantly falls off and is somewhat uncomfortable."
"the cord itself seems ok, i expected higher quality, something thick that could satisfy me knowing that it will actually last."
it does come with about 2 or 4 sets of earpads (cant remember) and it is a fancy good looking earphone.
"i just don't like the quality and comfort provided at $25, i would look elsewhereupdate:"
"second time using these, already hearing static noises"
...doubt this thing will last
i really like the sound on these earbuds-
"i like to listen to opera, and sometimes the richness of the orchestra and singers voices are lost in other earbuds."
not these.
the orange color of the cord is cool
and i’ve received compliments on them.
"my biggest issue, and i’ll be reaching out for support on this, is that i’ve barely used them"
and it seems like there is some type of issue with the port connection itself.
"the right ear sound seems to be shorting out with any type of movement, but i believe i’ve pinned down the issue to the very end of the cord where it connects in to the computer."
will ask for refund or replacement—-
maybe these were a faulty pair?i'll update my review once i figure out a replacement pair.
these headphones are attractive and sound great--both for music/podcasts and for telephone calls.  
i knocked off one star because:1.
"like others, i found the included plastic buds painful in my ear, regardless of the size used."
i switched them with an extra set i had at home
and all was well.2.
the wood separated near the metal band.
"easy to fix with some super glue, but this would've been disastrous for someone who is rougher on their headphones."
"wonderful sound, crisp highs, deep lows, and very efficient; you might have to lower your volume compared to other headphones."
very comfortable.
"like any ""in your ear"" variant, your ear is closed off, and the benefits of not hearing anything else around you, but also not disturbing other people, especially in quiet environments, are beautifully realized with these."
"the only downside is your ear isn't ""breathing"", and the wax may start to liquefy with the added heat..."
but this is a small issue.
workmanship is top of the line.
"ergonomically, very thoughtful details throughout, especially the cord, the jack, and the relief rubber near the tops."
icing on the cake is the beautiful wood.
"with care, these seem built to last many years."
"get them with you favorite color cord and be ready to smile and nod when you press ""play""."
you won't be disappointed.
i bought a set of these for my self and loved the fullness of the bass
so i bought several pairs for the family.  
the wood frame has come free of the plastic piece with the earbud on almost half of them.
i have caught it relight after they came apart before further damage occurred and with some super glue got them back together good as new.  
this happened after about 4 months of use on each of them.  
the super glue has held for about 2 months
so the fix seems to work fairly well.
i love the sound of these but the version with the braided cord does have a lot of noise from rubbing my clothes when i move around.
"mi still love the overall sound, though when i use my other headphones i realize how over emphasized the bass is with these."
"truthfully, i might try another brand as the ungluing could have been a big hassle if it happened when i wasn't home.  "
i guess super glue is pretty easy to find everywhere though
"the sound is a bit more quiet on these than what i've used before, but the bass quality is really good."
"though i'm kind of disappointed because i thought the cable would be braided, but it wasnt"
", it was just this weird ""no-tangle"" technology that they covered the cable with and it feels kind of sticky and likes to get caught my clothing or other parts of the cable and can rip my earbuds out if i'm walking."
the cord also has a kink in it someways down the cord
and i'm unsure if that was just extra surrounding cable that got bunched up or if it was permanent damage caused by the packaging that caused it to bend.
it hasn't affected the audio quality
so i dont mind.
"but for a $25 pair of earbuds, i would have expected better quality control."
the wood looks good.
"i've always used metal/brass earbuds in the past, but these are a pleasant change."
hopefully they hold up.
i bought these because i was tired of using the crappy headset at work.  
"these are not only comfortable, but the sound that comes out of them is surprisingly very good.  "
"i say that because i own 2 sets of bose in-ear headphones plus one over-the-ear set and for this price, the sound coming from these is almost as good as my bose.  "
"and for me, that's saying a lot because my ear can usually hear the difference between inexpensive and expensive, but worth it, headphones.  "
there's a lot of bang for your buck in these little babies
and i was pleasantly surprised.  
"though i purchased these for listening to dictation at work, and for listening to streamed music, i will be curious to see how they sound plugged into my ipod.  "
they are also very pretty.  
not something you usually hear about a set of headphones.  
i'm very happy with these and highly recommend them.
i was excited about trying wood earbuds.
these were decent on sound and noise cancellation.
but the cord is super noisy if it brushes or bumps anything.
it also tangles really easily and does not to like to be untangled.
"after owning them for only a few months, one of the buds just fell apart."
"was hoping for more from these, but they are definitely one of the poorest ranking pair of earbuds i’ve tried."
"i was not expecting to much from these headphones with the low price and all,but they really surprised me."
"the bass is not to heavy,but satisfying."
they can handle more bass without distortion if you want to use bumped up settings.
the highs are clear without the overly piercing tones and the mids are good but may become muddled just a hint at really high volumes.
i usually use mine with no extra settings and they sound great at normal to high volumes.
so why not five stars??
one thing is that i can really hear the thumps and rubs against the wires...
so if you plan on running or doing strenuous activities you may have the same problem.
"two, while the wood sounds great and everyone seems to like themthere was a problem withthe rubber coating."
looks like they ran out and tried to heat weld an extension to mine.
"the cables look and feel sturdy, but i just fear the sections may seperate."
for what i paid and what i recieved these two thing were nowhere near a deal breaker for me...they sound great and thats what i bought them for.
these sounded amazing
but i wanted to wait and write a review until i had a chance to wear these in my mini convertible.
i have worn two other pair of various quality and there's such a difference.
with the symphonized ear buds i was blown away at how clearly i heard the music and how much of the wind noise was blocked.
"hands down, these are the best."
"i used to have bose ear buds that cost over $100, and they didn't sound any better than these do."
i like the clip to attach to clothes
"so i don't accidently yank the buds out of my ears, and the cotton bag is a perfect storage solution."
"i also love the color of the orange cord with the wooden buds- so much more refind (yet, hip) than the standard black or white.  "
"i love these things and will be sticking with them whenever i want more, and will be gifting them to people i love."
i was very skeptical about this product
but once i received them and listened to them for an extended period of time i'm a believer.  
"howvever, there are a few caveats, but first the good.  "
these have very clear mids and highs in their tone.  
i am a bose user and i would say that the symphonzed are very similar in this area.  
unreal considering the price!  
"these were clearly better than my old pair of klipsch and had a clearer sound than my beats studios, which of course, are made for the bass.  "
"the downside, the bass needs help.  "
"i found that when these buds are matched with the poweramp app, you are able to crank the bass and truly tweak the sound.  "
"when i've done this, i can't believe the sound they produce at under $35.  "
"i still love my bose, but for the money, and for those of you that may not want to put your expensive buds at risk by losing them, try these.  "
they are amazing for the price you pay.
product arrived on time and in perfect condition.
i like the wood (verses
plastic)and
the braided cords(more
on that later)
the soundstage seemed wider than my pioneer set.
sound was full and range was wide.
this set delivers a lot of bass.
i think they are well worth the $25.i would give them 5 stars except for the cords.
the braided look and feel lead to noise when the cords are moved.
"i would not recommend these to anyone who walks, exercises,or works with them on.  "
i read many of the reviews and knew about the noisy cords .
i am not active when using these so i am not affected.  
[update]
i have been using these for some time now and they seem to sound better than when i wrote the original review.
i can now say that these are worth every penny
and then some.
i would buy them again with no hesitation.
"i got these just a couple days ago, along with the panasonic rphje120a set."
"they are replacing a set of soul by ludacris earbuds, which never stayed in the ear."
the build is awesome.
very sturdy buds.
"at first the wood seemed like plastic because it has a very smooth finish, but it's definitely wood."
the tips seal so well that they sometimes invert when i pull them out.
"this is very good news, as my previous pair would fall out from simply chewing."
the cable is a tough weave with a sort of laquer on it.
"it's very flexible, yet sturdy."
"the only disadvantage is that the extra thickness makes sound travel through it better, so you end up with a lot of brushing noises in many situations."
i was a little bummed
"it did not have buttons with the microphone, but i won't knock anything since this is listed beforehand, and part of the product i purchased."
"the sound, at first, took me as very dark and bassy."
i'm used to brighter earphones
"and i use flat-response monitor headphones for music creation, so"
i'm used to very little bass.
"i'm not sure if the earbuds had ""burned in"" or if i just got used to them, but now they sound quite balanced."
"they have somewhat high response in the very low >30hz range, so much so that in my flecktones albums, i can hear when victor wooten bumps or puts his hands on his bass."
"i find it kinda neat, but that's a matter of personal preference."
"these earbuds should last me quite some time now, and hopefully the build will hold up for an extended period."
"the sound quality is nice and warm, but two major issues:  even after changing the flexible tips, the earbuds keep falling out of my ears because they're heavier than other earbuds, and also the cord really wants to twist in upon itself all the time, even after you disentangle it.  "
"the buds don't feel heavy when on; they're just heavy enough to break the seal and fall out of your ears, which is annoying, because you keep having to shove them back in.  "
i really hate the cord though.  
"it's thicker than usual earbud cords, and it's good quality"
"- hasn't broken or worn at all, but it's so twisty and won't stay straight.  "
"it always feels like it is wrong, and even if i detach it from my phone and straighten it out, it still wants to twist.  "
it's hard to describe it
but it is very annoying.
"i liked the sound quality, but, it seems like these earbuds have a shelf life of six months, since, this is the third set that has quit on me."
"i didn't use the warranty for the first pair, but, i did for the second."
"i called it in and, hopefully, i'll get a response, given that the warranty is for two years."
"i really like the way they look, as well, so"
", i will give it another try."
"when i first saw these earbuds, i was desperate."
i was sick and tired of buying $10 and even $20 earbuds from walmart and getting the same result over and over again:
them breaking in just a few months.
i did not want to even handing out money like that for something i think should last at least a year.
"so, i turned to amazon with its endless choices."
symphonized was intriguing with their beautiful wood finish and overall cheap price.
"for the quality, i was willing to pay the $25."
"the day they came was very exciting, since i'd been without any working earbuds for about a week and was close to pulling my hair out."
"i constantly use my earbuds to isolate noise from my surroundings, especially in school settings where classmates are loud and annoying."
symphonized certainly didn't disappoint.
"the sound quality blew me away, especially when bass was present."
the wood amplifies the sound so well and really does isolate noise like no other pair of earbuds that i've bought.
"the echo created from the cord hitting things doesn't bother me, but it has been about four months since i bought these and the glue problem is beginning to show itself."
"both earbuds are coming apart and i'm pushing them together in a futile effort to ""re-stick"" the pieces together."
it doesn't help too much considering
they just come apart once i take them out of my ear.
"other than the glue problem, these earbuds are worth the money and deserve a five-star rating!"
"just use a stronger, longer-lasting brand of glue and you have yourself a winner, symphonized.*edit:"
it's been seventeen months and these poor things finally broke; a person's hand managed to slam down on the jack while it was connected to my computer and managed to bent the thing.
"a shame, but i certainly got my money's worth out of these, in my humble opinion."
i've already bought the 3.0 red/gray ones and love them so far.
"still expecting to glue the pieces on the wood and metal part like the first ones, but that's no problem at all with the power of superglue!"
"i think you have yourself a loyal customer, symphonzed."
;)
great sound quality
but they would never stay in my ears.
the wires were also thick and a little stiff so they would conduct noise up to your ears everytime they hit something
or you moved.
a little distracting at first
but i got used to it.
"the worst part was they just didn't stay in my ears, they would always work themselves out."
i would also have to reach up and push them back in every 10 minutes.
got very annoying.
gave them to my girlfriend and they seemed to stay in her ears ok.
but then they broke after she had them for only a couple of months.
granted she is very hard on her earphones
so it may not be totally a quality issue.
"but yeah, sound quality wise...awesome!"
everything else...eh.
"best headphones i've tried in the sub-$30 range and believe me, i've tried a lot."
i'm no audiophile
"and i don't know how to talk about the various specifics of sound and music, but one thing that's immediately obvious is how rich and full the bass is with these babies."
my music just sounds better with these than the other contenders i've tried.
the package also includes a nifty little drawstring bag and more replacement ear squishies than i'll probably ever need.
another thing that solidified my love for these is symphonized's customer service.
my original pair lost sound in one bud after a few months.
"when i messaged symphonized about the problem (promptly, and politely!"
"that's important!), they were quick to issue an apology and replacement, no questions asked."
i've so much faith in these headphones and the customer service that i immediately ordered another pair for my bf.
"for the quality, price, and customer service, i don't think you can go wrong with symphonized."
"so far they seem well made, but only time will tell."
they block out most outside noise very well and produce a nice warm tone but not overly bassy.
"they come with several ear pieces in various sizes, a pouch to store everything in and a lapel clip for the microphone."
i haven't placed a call yet
so i don't know how it sounds on the other end and don't care.
"i find them very comfortable and sound nice for the types of music i listen to which is mostly classic rock, oldies 40's to 70's and meditation music, now at very high volume."
they are still fairly new
so i'm not sure how long they will last.
they samsung earbuds that came with
my tablet and phone sounded
okay
but both broke
and i was about to spend tons of money over priced fad dr whoever.
decided to pick these up on a deal of the day.  
they look great and are accessorized nicely.  
sound is not bad.  
"i have a cheap pair of klipsch that my wife constantly ""borrows"" and they have a better bass response and clarity.  "
guess
"my my wife can now ""borrow"" the nrg 2.0 from me now and i will stick with the klipsch buds."

the company's customer satisfaction team reached out to me after my review to inquire about my experience.  
they suggested that i try a different model for what my needs were.  
they were spot on.  
great service
and once they identified what i was looking for problem was solved.
"i love everything about these earbuds: great sound, attractive style with the wood, durability."
"the mic on the cord has a clicker that allows you to pause, play, skip, and repeat music tracks which is convenient."
this company is also fabulous to work with!
i was missing just one small silicone ear tip replacement
(they come with the different size ear tip replacements and mine
came with 3 mediums and 1 small instead of 2 each).
"before i could contact the seller, they had already emailed me to see if i was satisfied with my purchase."
i told them of the miscount and they immediately apologized and mailed me several new sets of silicone ear tips at no charge!
i was very impressed with their desire to satisfy their customers!
it worked!
i'm happy!
this is a great pair of headphones!  
the wood body of the earbuds are unique and nicely made.  
the audio is crystal clear and the type of braided cable they use resists tangling like that is always present in the cheap plastic ones.  
a nice plus is the cloth bag that can hold the extra rubber pieces.  
i would recommend these for anybody looking for a corded earbud style headphone for work or
home.03/2018 update - glue problem that is often mentioned in the low star reviews is a real concern.  
i bought this in 2016 and it sat in my desk for the most part.  
started a new commute 14 months ago and have used these 2 hrs daily under normal conditions for seattle (meaning rainy winter but not terribly cold).  
downgrading to a 2 star reviews and shopping for new headphones as i'm done fighting with these
i initially really enjoyed these headphones.
the sound quality is decent.
"however, shortly after i started using them, the left earbud stopped working completely."
within 6 months the other earbud started to fall apart.
another negative is that the heavy plastic coating on the wire makes a lot of noise when it rubs against your clothes or jacket.
"also, the headphones are not actually made of wood, but are rather plastic colored to look like wood."
after a few months the wood-colored covering started to chip away revealing the plastic underneath.
"lastly, there is no volume control on the clicker."
"i've ordered 4 pair of these now, after trying apple brand, other brands, expensive and inexpensive."
these symphonized earbuds last and last.
"i love the wood, and the plastic-wrapped cord keeps them from tangling."
"sound quality is great, mics always work."
"i'm not an audiophile, but enjoy bass and clarity."
great sound at this price point.
"the only set not still in service is the one that got caught in a car door on a 5-hour drive.im glad they come in different colors, so family members won't squabble over whose is whose."
i liked the curved jack...
"fyi, if you step on them by accident, even with your flip flops, adios amigos..."
not very satisfied with this purchase.
"the sound, its ok...the ""amazing"" wood..."
nothing worth talking about.
i am a musician
and i use in-ear monitors from shure and other high quality headphones...
the samsung that came with my s5 sounded actually better.
they do have good sound isolation...
"i bought a pair of sentey headphones, and i was about to return them before i even open them, and after i got disappointed with these"
", i was like let me try them..."
wow...
"i think they actually have better sound, sit better in my ear, they do feel kind of cold (metal) but its definitely a keeper, and cheaper too..."
after spending a fortune on skull and other headphones for my ipod i'd had enough of them breaking after a couple of weeks and having to buy new ones.
i also hated the poor sound quality and decided i wanted to find a good set.
i came across
symphonized nrg 2.0 premium genuine wood in ear earphones on amazon and after reading the reviews decided to order a couple of them.
they arrived yesterday and i immediately opened them and plugged them in to my ipod.
"right off the bat, i was completely blown away by the sound!"
the acoustics from the wood is amazing.
i also love the non-tangle cord.
as for wear and tear i can't say until after a few weeks.
"i will update at a later date, but i can honestly say that so far i love these earphones and the sound they produce."
makes me want to listen to music all day long!
i was nervous about purchasing these.
"thought either, they'll be awesome or turn out to be an overpriced piece of crap."
guess what...
?they
are awesome!i actually own a pair of beats
audio ear buds ...
"however, they seem to have sprouted legs and disappeared.  "
so those are what i have to compare anything to.
"i'm happy, in fact i'm impressed."
i love that they're made of real wood.
"so there's touch of ""class"" added to my listening experience."
"worth the cost, even if i find my old ones...these will still be my favorite."
"price to quality-wise, these are hands down the best headphones ever."
the sound quality is better than $60 and $70
pairs
"i've bought in the past, the ventilation on back allows the air vibrations to escape (this is a way bigger deal than it sounds, i never noticed how percusive and irritating other earbuds were"
"but this is the main reason i'm sticking with this brand till one of us dies), they're incredibly light (again a way bigger deal than it sounds, you dont realise how irritating other's are until you put these on and forget they're even in your ears) very cheap, and i mean come on, theyre gold and wood headphones..."
i cant even count how many times people asked what they were and where to get them.
the jack or strain relief has gone bad after only a few weeks of use - i only get sound in one ear unless i twist and bend the wires around.
"also, the earbuds are too wide for my ears, no matter the tips you put on them."
"i reached out to symphonized immediately, and to their credit they sent new tips but that didn't help."
i have other pairs from symphonized
- they fit my earholes fine - but these one hurt.
only use this brand for my iphone.
"for many years now, i have introduced my friends to this comfortable, awesome sound quality product."
"for the price, this is the best bang for the buck— hands down!!"
i operate in noisy conditions at work.
the noise in the work environment requires ear protection for safety reasons.
"on fridays, for the weekend shutdown, i am allowed to use my earbuds to listen to music."
i feel the symphoinized brand earbuds protect my hearing from the loud work environment much better than the protection i use during the rest of the work week.
love them.
"also, love the length and quality of the cord the earbuds provide."
over the years the cord has come in a variety of materials...
i was happy with the first set and disappointed when i received a set made with a different material
until i used the latest version!
every change has been an improvement in my opinion.
the sound through these is amazing!
the music plays so clearly and perfectly.
"the wires are excellent quality and after using every day for over a month, still haven't gotten any cracks or problems."
(my friend has had his for 2 years and still no problems.)
this also comes with a ton of rubber ear options and a nice small cloth bag for them.
it's worth the money!!!
"you won't regret it!update: a year and half after my purchase, they still work just as well and no wire problems."
i'd have gone through 3 cheap headphones by now.
so glad i bought these instead!!
"i was on the market for a replacement of my standard earphones that came with my iphone, as the cord was starting to wear."
"i felt that, instead of getting another set of the iphone earphones, i should seek out an improved pair of earphones."
"unfortunately, i was not as satisfied as i wanted to be."
"when unboxing, i saw that these headphones looked just as good as they do in the images."
the wood accents are a great feature in terms of aesthetics.
"from the three sizes of silicone ear tips, i found the large ones fit me best."
"they are snug enough to not fall out of my ear, but still provides plenty of comfort."
the sound quality of these earphones is very good.
"they do a good job of muffling out the noises around you, so you can stay focused if you are normally in a distracting environment."
my biggest complaint is the microphonics (the rustling or thumping noises heard when the cord hits or brushes up against something).
"i have used multiple different earphones in the past, and none have produced microphonics like this."
"the shirt clip provided reduces the microphonics somewhat, but i don't like using the shirt clip as i move around my desk quite a bit throughout the day."
"pros: aesthetically pleasing, good sound qualitycons: poor microphonicsi would recommend these to anyone who sits completely still when using earphones, or doesn't mind the loud rustling noise when the cord hits something."
recently ordered these headphones not expecting too much.
i just wanted a cheap pair to replace an older pair of headphones i've had for years.
"due to the age of the older pair, they lack a mic."
"once i saw these for $25, i decided to try them out."
"after using them for a week or so, i've come to the conclusion that for the money, they're hard to beat."
"pros: good sound quality (in my opinion) for the price, great looking wood ear buds,"
"good mic quality on phone call and video recording, hard to tangle, lots of in-ear size options."
"cons: bulky jack, rubbery feeling line, cable seems a tad bit long."
"side note: even with all the in-ear size options they offer, they were just a bit big for my ear."
i entered up using the smaller ones from my old pair.
"so if you have small ear canals, you may way to look for smaller size pieces."
"all-in-all, hard to beat for the price."
great earphones but my older one
"i am still using(this one lasted nearly 2 years, still going,yay!)"
has lost one of
it's
chrome rear  'port' and one half  is loose showing off
it's wires(the mic side).
"maybe it  needs better glue at the factory, although it still works."
"i do practically use it everyday, mostly for commuting, so it has outlasted my previous nuforce and brainwavez units which are excellent sounding too except for construction quality."
"when the price is right, i do buy these as gifts."
highly recommended.
christmas is not too far away!!!
tried these with an iphone 6.
"the sound quality was good, much better than my cheapo bluetooth headphones i've been using."
"the construction is also nice - the wire feels solid, and the wood is a nice accent (but definitely"
just a gimmick
- i doubt it contributes to the sound quality very much at this size).i
"returned these because:- the aux plug is angled at like 45 degrees, and felt like it would be the first to break-"
"i didn't realize these were the 2.0s, which means they only have pause/play control and not volume"
control-
"the actual metal part of the aux plug is very long, and kept jiggling out of its socket slightly, causing the music to randomly change volume and pause"
"itselfmight try the 3.0s, but i definitely will return them if the aux cord is still terrible."
light weight earbuds that look great in wood grain and sound better than expected for the price.
i have tried other earbuds that cost twice as much but their sound did not measure up to standards.
these nrg 2.0 fit very good in the ear.
i tried several tips( 6 sets are included) to get the right sound as the wrong size tips give a less than desired sound.
bass is really good and the highs are crisp and clean coming from my ipod.
i hope these last a long time
and they should as the cords are heavy duty.
the only thing i don't like is the angled plug but it doesn't affect my review
it is just something to get accustomed to.
"as far as sound quality goes, it was good."
"not mind blowing, but good."
bass notes/sounds were well pronounced and provided a refreshing amount of impact but not heavy.
the rest of the range was clear.
the microphone and associated button work great.
loud ambient noises such as a lawn mower were reported to produce similar amount of white noise to a bluetooth system in a car with the windows down with the voice being easily louder.
"the sound cancelling on the other hand, not so great."
the silicone inserts were finicky at best and even at their best didn't block out quite enough sound.
the foam that is not unlike actual earplugs almost always does a better job.
overall construction was good.
"mostly finished well, and rugged enough to handle outdoor work when routed not to get in the way."
"the cable isn't floppy, nor is it stiff... slightly less than al dentè noodle."
"to sum them up, they're fine for most situations(library, home, automobile, exercise etc.), just not the ones for which they were bought for (tv/conversation deadening and lawn mowing)."
as such they get my recommendation.
i have a lot of problems wearing earbud style headphones because they never stay seated in my ear or start to hurt after a short period of time.
"i've tried a variety of styles, such as apple's old and new offerings as wells as skullcandy earbuds."
"the skullcandy earbuds were better, but still caused pain after some time."
i was about to give up on earbuds completely but really needed something that would be easy to throw in my backpack for work.
the symphonized nrg 2.0 earbuds have a common design
so i'm not sure why they are more comfortable for me than others that i've tried.
"maybe it is simply the material used for the ear """
"things""."
"all in all, this was a great purchase."
"these earbuds are inexpensive, they seem durable with good build quality, the sound quality is good (not fantastic), and they even come with a simple cloth pouch."
"okay, the sound quality is great.  "
it's clear and the bass is perfect.  
i have three children.  
"my oldest is autistic and i often use my headphones to help me relax when she's having a ""loud"" day and can't help her loud humming, stimming, etc.  "
these cancel out enormous amounts of noise.  
my only complaint is that i have weird ear canals and none of the earbud covers keep the earbuds in my ears for more than a few minutes before i'm having to push them back in.  
"i contacted customer service and they have resolved the issue for me, so i'm pretty happy with these, especially for the price!"
"for the price, these headphones are outstanding.  "
"i was looking into getting higher end headphones that were over $100, but my husband barred me from getting him anything that expensive.  "
"then, i found these, and decided based off the sleek look, and great reviews, to give it a shot.  "
"i was a bit apprehensive since my husband was looking at bose-type headphones, and felt this might fail him, but turns out, he really loves this item and raves about it's performance, sound quality and durability.  "
"he's had it for several months now, and uses it regularly.  "
the pouch that it comes with is also very handy.
i love things made out of wood and these appear to be well made but the pair i received had problems with the right ear being significantly lower in sound
and i had trouble finding the right size earbud.  
small seemed too small and the medium seemed too big.  
i didn't want to mail them back due to how beautiful they were
but i did end up returning them.  
the cord has an attractive cloth that is coated with a clear plastic protective coating.
the packaging is all very nice and they come with a little canvas pouch.  
symphonized seems like a great brand
and i'd like to try the over-the-ear wooden headphones that they carry.  
i think those might work out better for me.
audio quality is much better than any other earbud i have ever used.
almost has a concert sound to them.
good base too for earbuds.
they do a decent job at blocking out sounds around you too.
there built tough
", i have accidentally closed a tilt up bed onto one of the earbuds, its hardly noticeable if you look at it"
and it didn't affect the performance at all.
i have also fallen asleep with them in and rolled over pulling on the cord hard enough to wake me up on multiple occasions
yet they never break or even came loose at all.
i love how long the cord is and they also hold up well to sweat
(i've worn them under my shirt a lot in the gym).
they also come in a nice pull-sting bag that has 2 extra sets of buds one black and one clear in case you loose or wear out the originals.
id recommend this to anyone that enjoys ear buds.
i loved these so much.
they were great for noise cancelling and so cute.
the first pair i got lasted a year before the tip broke off and wires fell apart inside the little ear piece.
this time they lasted even less :(
love them
but they are not super durable
it seems
sound isnt high quality
"( i am aware they arent expensive), these seem to be more about looks than quality."
ear buds don't stay in my ear at any size
very well i am guessing because the cables are so rigid that they pull the earbuds away from your head as they curve over your cheekbones.
i have a few different earbuds from different makers and i can say these have lasted the longest....
but maybe only because i don't use them much.
pretty quiet too...
mids highs and bass
...
well nothing stands out.
"these phones sounded pretty good but fell apart after only a few uses, however the company immediately sent me a new set of earplugs after reading my review and i haven't had a problem with them since."
so i changed my 1 star to a 5 star.
an company that makes a product and backs it up like this is worthy of 5 stars.
plus they do sound very nice especially for the price.
obviously i don't get paid to do advertisements as a customer
so you can believe me when i say these are worth it.
plus the company has love for their customers.
what more can you ask?
great sound!
they do have a great amount of bass.
i have always loved wood ear buds.
though when i ordered these no where did it really talk about the cable.
and from the looks of the pic i had hoped they'd have been nylon wrapped.
these are rubber.
though pretty in color (i bought the purple)
i will probably be ordering another pair nylon corded.
i have cats who tend to hint out my headphones and chew the wiring :-/
these are replacing my $75 pair of thick flat corded ones they chewed :-(
which these are very comparable in sound.
very pleased.
(4 star based off non nylon wrapped)
i love the sound quality of these ear buds.
the wire at the plug is starting to break
and it's losing output from time to time.
i did not put these through much abuse like i did my other ear buds and was sort of disappointed it's already giving out.
edit:
"a few months after this review, i realized it was my laptop that was bringing down the volume on its own."
i saw a couple of other devices that do this too.
it had nothing to do with these ear buds.
they still work great!
these are just fantastic!
i have at least four pairs of (cheap $10) headphones
"i've invested in the past year, and they've all somehow broke with some everyday use"
"-- the wires would break, the earpiece would disconnect, stuff like that."
so i decided to invest in a good pair of headphones that were a little bit above my usual budget.
i've had these for about two weeks
and they just work really wonderfully.
my roommate likes to video
chat
"her friends back home often while i work, and these headphones are perfect from blocking out the background noise."
sound quality is equally amazing and far superior than any other headphones i've ever owned.
don't think i'll ever look back!
interesting to see the whole spectrum of reviews.
for 25 bucks?
stop the ridiculousness.
these things outperform anything in it's price class and they look nice as well.
i did not get these for free
i simply did a ton of research to decide pulling the handle on these things.
now granted.
i have the lg v10 with the hi-fi dac and they sound fantastic.
buy'um and thank them for a nice product.
i think i'll buy another pair (something perhaps with a lighter wood look) just cause these things are fantastic and i appreciate quality for a great price.
for the price of $25 these earphones have better sound quality than most earphones double or triple this price.
the sound is clear and crisp with the wood giving an excellent base response.
this is my 2nd pair of nrg premium (the 1.0 got snagged in a door handle and it broke the internal wiring causing one of the earbuds to stop working)
and i have to say they have me hooked on how good the sound is.
i love the use of wood as wood has better acoustic properties than metal.
but even the good one are not without problem.
there are only 2 issues i have had while using these headphone: 1) the glue that hold the ear piece to the main cone (the part with the exhaust metal grill and wiring) wears off quickly.
this happened to me with the 1st pair i had as well.
"i just used gorilla glue and all was fine again, though i would like if symphonized can deal with this by replacing their glue to a better lasting one.2)"
their wiring need an anti-static coating of some sort.
"there is a static discharge that is audible when the wires rub against my clothes especially when its dry, like in the winters."
"that being said, these are one of the best earphones i've used and are in my top 10 for sound quality."
(i have use bose earphones as well).
needed another pair of earbuds as i rotate my units for longevity.  
"looked good out of the box, nice packaging and sounded decent.  "
couldn't get a solid fit even though i tried every pair of extra buds supplied.  
toe injury caused me to shut down my workoutson for about 6 weeks.  
"decided to get going with my workout program again this morning,  and the unit does not work!  "
this after only 6 weeks of actual use.  
"very poor decision on my part, i will never purchase this brand again.  "
"back to panasonic it is, i want my money back! !!"
i love my 2.0 symphonic earbuds.
"the sound quality is rich, i hear the different musical instruments when ilisten to different types of music."
i have no problems with my replacement pair and i will be a returning customer.
"they sound good, but after replacing pairs multiple times for my girlfriend and them all breaking, i can't give these a good rating."
"if you're looking for incredible price/performance check out the jiffy double driver earbuds, they are hands down the best sound quality for their price."
"pay for another driver instead of wood, you won't regret it."
had them for a week and a half so far still working.
loud had to turn the volume down on ipod.i like the clamp that came with them that is nice for clamping on to shirt
so they do not get caught on anything.
also like the caring bag that came with them to make it easy to carry them around.
and sound very good
i gave it 4 stars for now it
the future it could change.
cause i do not know how long they will last if they last over 2months with out a speaker going out .
it will be a 5.
also like the the jack that it is at a angel  that sems to help lots for the cord not getting a short in it like the straight ones
"i have been using these headphones for 4+ hours a day, monday through friday, for 1 month."
the pause/play/skip button works fine on my volt 2 android phone which is not supported by many accessories.
"i was very pleased with the sound quality (good balance between volume, treble, and bass)."
they include multiple rubber ear tips but
the default ones fit in my ears comfortably and stable.
"big fan for the price, would buy again in a different color or when these ones eventually break."
sound about as good as my sennheiser hd 229
on ear head phones....which sound better to my ear than any other headphones i've tried from another manufacturer under $200....and better than some over $200 like beats.
the cord due to being rubberized for added strength is a bit tangly...
"but for this sort of sound,especially at this price,i couldn't care less."
finally great bass in earbuds at a reasonable price!oh
yeah...
and with such great response you can even crank them on ur cell phone without using an amplifier...
so loving these babies!!
"i've had a few sets of earbuds in the past, and these are the best i've had so far.  "
they're comfortable and sound excellent.  
"i cannot vouch for their durability, since i've only had them a short time.  "
"i know all my earbuds in the past ended up having problems with the wiring, and one (or both)"
if the speakers stopped working.  
"i don't think i'm particularly rough on my earbuds; i treat them gently and handle them carefully, but they don't usually last too long for one reason or another.  "
we shall see how well these survive.
"i have three pairs,, one pair gets used 3 times a week for sweaty workouts for 2 hours  "
"these babies sound good,  stay put during rigorus workouts and take a beating and still work.  "
my orginal pair still working 3 years later.  
cant say enough positive things about them.
"in all honesty, these earbuds definitely worth buying."
"the cord is nice and durable, and the buds themselves produce great sound."
particularly the beat or bass when listening to the music.
my pair of buds haven't encountered any defects at all.
"though i must point out, the cord does get tangled and misshapen sometimes."
if an improved cord could be implemented then these would be better.
"but overall, definitely worth investing to."
i would reccomend these to anyone who doesn't want to spend over $100 but above the $20 mark.
actually am pleasantly surprised by these.
"of course, they are not the highest end phones, but i have purchased three diff types and brands recently and these are the best of the three."
"have a hearing issue, so i miss hearing full bass range but these are the closest i have found in this price range.  "
they stay in my ear better than the other two as well.  
i can recommend them.  
"dont expect the best of the best, but these are prety darn good."
the only thing they could improve i the strings...
"they need a guide on the top part, because they do easily tangle."
actually am pleasantly surprised by these.
"of course, they are not the highest end phones, but i have purchased three diff types and brands recently and these are the best of the three."
"have a hearing issue, so i miss hearing full bass range but these are the closest i have found in this price range.  "
they stay in my ear better than the other two as well.  
i can recommend them.  
"dont expect the best of the best, but these are prety darn good."
the only thing they could improve i the strings...
"they need a guide on the top part, because they do easily tangle."
great!
"i have used them all day while walking, youtubing, and gaming!"
"the headphones stay in, sound great!i came from a traditional set of ""cans"" and noticed quite a bit of bass."
"treble can sound a little (pardon the pun) woody, not tin (as in cheap)"
but as if the sound is being reflected off a flat surface.
it sounds very natural and i like it over all.
only gripe is the microphone is kinda low down the cord.
i would like a set where the microphone is higher up the cable!
not durable at all.
i bought a pair for work to use when unloading truxks
"then one earbud went out, no issue."
"i have the warranty so go and tell them, they instantly send it no issue."
thr 2nd pair didnt even last a day...
worst part is they broke in my phone and had
to pay 65 dollars to fix it.
the jack is cheaply made and really thin compared to other headphones.
i have purchase four sets of these earbuds.
(3 as gifts for my teenaged children)
the sound is excellent and the earbuds look great.
the ones i have used are still working great after more than a year of use.
the 3 i ordered as gifts all turned up with problems soon after they rcvd them.
not a big surprise that my youngest tore his up in short order but my 15yo twins take very good care of their electronics and such.
"despite not being very promot to contact the company, my son finally communicated with the customer service dept re the issues."
their response was very quick and they are replacing two pairs.
(i did not request a replacement for my youngest as i am confident his earbuds failed due to his own negligence)
i would score 5stars for the earbuds based on sound but having issues with two pair brought my overall score to 4stars.
their customer service however deserves 6 stars if not more.
i feel comfortable recommending this product based on the fact that the product is great and if you do end up having a problem the company stands behind their product
w/ their superb customer service.
these ear buds are fantastic!
"the rubber caps that came standard were much too big for my ears, but all i had to do was switch to the smallest ones and they fit perfectly."
the sound quality is deep and rich and there's no reverberation noise when the cable moves around.
i wear these with only one ear bud in when i'm biking and it stays snugly in my ear.
i also wear them when i'm at the office and people have had to tap me on the shoulder to get my attention they are so effective at blocking out noise.
"top it all off with a modern wooden aesthetic, a nifty carrying bag (which i find super useful for preventing myself from leaving it in my pocket and then washing them), and a stiff cord that doesn't get knotted or bend"
and you've got some superb ear buds at a great price!p.s.
i did wash these once and they work 100% fine afterwards.
"no idea what washing will do to the longevity of the ear buds, but for now it made no difference, thank goodness."
i was not very impressed with the sound quality.
"i have a pair of jbl e10 earbuds, and they are sometimes too quiet on the street, so i wanted to get a different pair to try out."
"these have distance in the sound, but the clarity i found lacking."
"also, i have medium measured ear plug fit, but even with the smallest silicone tips these are too large."
i had purchased the original nrg's a while back and was skeptical at first.  
how good can a pair of $25 headphones be?  
well the answer is: amazing.
unfortunately i have lost that pair
so i decided to go with the new version of the headphones.  
"if the old headphones were amazing, these were unbelievable for a pair of $25"
headphones!pros:
looks:
"i believe that is up to the individual, but i do enjoy there colors i chose.  "
they are really bright and give them earbuds a nice pop!the build quality  of this product is fantastic.  
the wires are braided and then covered with a plastic that feels really strong and durable.  
i don't see these braking anytime soon.  
and the wooden pieces feel very strong as well.
the sound quality is also fantastic for a pair of $25 headphones.  
"the bass is strong, the mids and treble are balanced too.  "
"as long as you fit the correct size ear pieces, you can achieve tremendous noise isolation.  "
for a pair of $25 headphones this is unreal.  
i literally could not be happier with these earbuds.
cons:
absolutely none.
"if you have $25 to spend on a pair of headphones and you don't purchase these, you clearly don't enjoy nice things."
edit:
12/8/16after
i wrote the initial review
", i was contacted by symphonized customer service.  "
"after describing the problem to them, i was offered a replacement pair free of charge.  "
"the new pair works great!original:until i lost them about  a month ago, i owned a pair of the previous model of symphonized nrg earbuds.  "
"they were attractive, durable and produced excellent sound so my first thought was to replace them with another pair of symphonized earbuds.  "
"unfortunately, within the first three days, the audio had stopped working on the new pair of symphonized headphones.  "
"in order to get any sound to come out, i had to bend the cord at the base (near the aux connection).  "
"i suspect that the connection had broken, either due to poor quality, or defective materials.  "
"i really liked the first pair i had, but unfortunately, the second pair didn't last a week."
i bought these headphones for less than $20 and they are excellent.
if you like your music with a little extra bass these things for the price can't be beat.
the build quality is excellent.
i have had mine for 3 years and they still work as good or better as the first day.
my whole family has these headphones.
i purchased these earbuds in march 2016.
they have far exceeded my expectations.
i have put these through the wringer.
these have accidentally been through the washing machine at least twice.
i've snagged the cable on things many times.
they get wound up and thrown in my work bag every day.
"i will admit that the earbuds separated at the metal ring like you see in some reviews, but that was likely after a going through the washer/dryer."
"i super glued them back together (2 years ago), and they were good as new."
these still sound excellent and are like new 3 years later.
very impressed!
prosdecent sound quality (better than iphone)i like the looki like the tangle free cord.
cord seems a lot more durable than the iphone headphonesconsi personally don't like how much sound they block out.
"when i'm walking around or riding my bike using the headset, i wanna be able to hear my surroundingsit comes with like 6-7 different size earbud ends,"
none of which fit my ear well.
the earbuds are constantly falling off my ears.
"to get them to stay put, you have to put them really deep insidethe ears, which feels uncomfortable"
"sound is great, however the audio went out in 1 ear after 4 days."
"this is with normal use, limited to transfers in and out of my pockets."
"oh well, i really liked the sound of these."
edit:
"after posting a previous 2-star for the defective pair, i was contacted by sophia from symphonized and was informed there was a warranty of 1 year for the pair of headphones."
i think it's wonderful by symphonized to go out of their way to make sure a customer is aware of a warranty and offer a replacement pair.
"as i said before, the sound is really great in these headphones"
and i'm looking forward to being able to use the next pair for a long time.
i bought these to replace my bob marley ones...
my kitten chewed the ends off my old ones.
"this is the first time i have used the symphonezed earbuds, and i am very pleased with the quality."
i am giving this 5 stars due to the high quality of sound from the ear buds.
the turqoise cord is very stiff-
"it is not fabric, it is coated in plastic."
these earphones are fantastic.  
"it does a great job at blocking all outside sound, and i must mention they do come with warranty.  "
"i accidentally damaged the jack of the earphones while on a plane, and because of this only one side of the earphone worked.  "
"after my travels, i saw that they emailed me saying it comes with a warranty.  "
"i emailed them, and informed them of how i accidentally damaged them.  "
"a couple days later, they replied to me saying that they are sorry to hear what happened, and that they will send in a new one for me.  "
"the earphones are such great quality, and i am happy to say that their customer service is just as great.  "
"the cables of the earphones are super durable, and you can tell just by touching them.  "
"so if you're looking for some earphones that will last a long time, then get these.  "
especially since they come with warranty.
was a little skeptical that these would have the bass sounds i was looking for but was pleasantly surprised at how good they sound!!they don't have the big thumping bass that my old sonys had
but they do provide a solid deep bass sound that i can appreciate.
i also love the fact that even when at full volume there is hardly any noise bleed.
i like to crank up the volume and its nice that it wont botherothers close by.
i'd definitely recommend these to others and will probably by another pair just to have a backup.
so i've only had these for a few days.
they arrived perfect.
i play pubg with my sister and husband a lot and these helped with telling which direction other players were coming from.
they are well made and seem to be durable.
i bought another pair for my sister for christmas.
i got these headphones a while ago and really liked them.
"they sounded great, and i liked the way they looked."
"about 3 months later one of the earbuds broke, it wasn't really a big deal"
i eventually just superglued it back together.
it's a little bit disappointing that they fell apart seemingly quickly.
"then a few weeks after the first incident, the other earbud broke in the exact same way"
(the forward part of the earbud broke off at the part where there is a metal ring).
"again a little bit disappointing that this happened with both earbuds, but the real problem is that when they broke this time i guess the wires came loose or something because one earbud no longer works."
"overall i liked these headphones, they looked nice and sounded great, but they broke far too easily."
"something else to add is that i use these headphones at my home computer, they aren't under particularly strenuous conditions"
and i tend to keep them as undamaged as possible.
nice headphones.
these look more high end on the website than in person.
"not that they are cheap in person, they just don't quite hold up to their visual appearance on amazon, so i deducted one star."
still nice looking pair of headphones and different from what you see.
"good sound, good volume, nothing that will blow you away"
but i doubt anything in the $25 category will.
so for the price and intended use
i'm happy with them.
haven't used the mic yet for calls so can't comment on the sound quality for phone calls.
i've used these headphones for several months now and they are really nice.
"the sound quality is good, they're comfortable, and so far they've been quite durable."
they also cancel outside noise well.
i like how they come with a nice little storage bag and
the wood makes them quite unique looking.
i would recommend these headphones!

symphonized nrg 2.0 earbuds
| wood in-ear noise-isolating headphones | earphones with mic and innovative shield technology cable
(gunmetal)i purchased these headphones just a month and a week ago.
"when i received the headphones, i was extremely pleased."
"good, warm tones, sleek design, and perfect clarity."
"however, just a week ago, the button that controls pausing/skipping songs completely ripped apart."
i don't even know how it happened because that part of the earphone never receives any pressure.
i've attached some pictures.
"pretty much, only one earphone works now."
"for this price, i would have expected something that would have lasted at least a year, not to mention a month."
"tldr; sound is amazing, but the construction has flaws"
"5 months of use and one ear bud fell apart and the phone jack has to be in a certain position, otherwise sound is not coming through."
after i wrote this review was contacted by the customer service (very nice email) and new set of earphones was sent to me at no charge.
"my son has been using them for only a couple of weeks, so we'll see if these ones hold up better, but changing the rating to 5 stars because of the extremely nice customer service."
they sound pretty nice.
after a few months of use they started coming apart.
one of the speaker assemblies came out of the housing.
"the black, flexible part on the bottom of one of the buds broke as well."
edit:
symphonized contacted me on their own and offered to replace the earbuds that broke due to
them still being under warranty (which i didn't even think about).
good customer service - willing to please their customers.
these earbuds either fall apart or stop working.
i purchased several of these earbuds over the course of several months.
"the sound quality is excellent, but that is beside the point because one after another they fall apart or stop working."
this happened several times.
"symphonized refuses to provide refunds and instead offers to send replacements, which inevitably fall apart or stop working."
do not purchase these.
the quality is low and the company knows about the problem and continues to ship defective earbuds.
got these doe by teenager for christmas and he has used them every day since.
the cords are still in good shape (which never happens with the little cheapies you buy)
"they look really nice and unique, and he says that they sound great."
if you want mind numbing bass look elsewhere these earbuds are not for you...
"however, for those of us that appreciate the ability to hear every detail without sacrificing clarity look no further.  "
these earbuds sound great!  
the bass is there and deep but not overbearing.  
the highs are crisp and the mids are very full (more that likely due to the inherent acoustic properties of wood).  
i've had these earbuds since january and have had no issues
what so ever.  
build quality is excellent.  
"i was hesitant to make the purchase due to the ""cheap"" price point"
but i now have no regrets.  
don't waste you time or money buying more expensive earbuds...
i love the sound quality for the price.  
i had another set by this company and the ones
i had originally seemed to be more tangle free then these.  
"i still like them, but i was a little disappointed in the cord."
"after i posted my first review, i received an email from symphonized asking if they could have my shipping address to send me a new pair."
"i received them on monday, 11/6, and they work like the old ones did - wonderfully."
"now, i can ride bart without hearing all the racket."
"updating this to five stars because these headphones really are, including those who work at the company."
"really appreciate it, kara."
thank you again.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------i ordered these after my gold ones bit the dust from a few years of near everyday use.
this pair had the unfortunate problem with the right earbud.
it  would have to be shaken to get sound and just yesterday it no longer works.
i can no longer return these and am on the hunt for a new affordable pair.
the earbuds offer great sound.
"however, when i am at he gym, they become dislodged; fall out of my ears."
"also, the part that inserts into the jack makes a car killing noise, and sometimes i loose sound."
the earbuds offer great sound.
"however, when i am at he gym, they become dislodged; fall out of my ears."
"also, the part that inserts into the jack makes a car killing noise, and sometimes i loose sound."
"man, i really wanted to like these headphones."
they look nice and the sound is good.
"unfortunately, within a few months the glue on one of the ear buds stopped sticking, and the ear bud came apart."
symphonized was initially kind enough to replace them outright.
"however, within a month or so, the replacement pair started cutting out on one side."
"so, they then requested that i send both pairs back."
"it's been almost a month and at this point, it is not clear whether or not they are actually going to repair or send me a new pair at all. "
so i've basically paid for a product that i don't even have anymore.
"the first pair i almost could've fixed, but i shouldn't have had to."
now i'm just out time and money.
it seems that a lot of others have had issues as well.
"their customer service is also agonizingly slow, which is really frustrating when they're holding onto the thing that you bought."
i would definitely recommend staying clear of this company.
it's really not worth it.
"sound is good, but watch the size.  "
i read other posts about the bud being larger than expected.  
all true.  
the different size end pieces really do not help.  
the bulb is the problem.  
"it may be necessary for the sound, and i can live with that."
"the sound is rich, and they are worth consideration on that alone."
"but if you have small ears, you may want to look elsewhere."
really great sound.  
"after trying many buds, i am finding that even less expensive ones sound good if fit correctly.  "
one needs to choose the right size tips for the ears.
for only $25 these sound great.  
my son has bose buds.  
"he thought the wood looks cool, but when he tried these with his music the look on his face was comical.  "
he says he yet likes his bose
"but in a way, these actually sound better.  "
....
at a quarter of the cost.
"briefly, these are no better than ordinary headphones."
the sound quality is the same as any other.
there is no perceptible noise cancellation.
"the cord is less likely to tangle - true, but more likely to bend."
"finally, when the cord rubs against itself there is static transmitted up into the headphones.  "
"i have stopped using these and would not recommend them unless you like how they look, and not how they will function."
i used to buy earphones from discount stores but they either don't last long or the sound quality is bad.
i figured it was about time to dish out a little more money for something nicer.
after a lot of research i settled on these.  
i am no expert in quality of sound
but these definitely sound a lot better than anything i've used before.
i love the looks as well.
the wooden earpieces are unique and look nice.
the metallic looking cable is wrapped in plastic and do not tangle on me.
these also come with 3 sizes of ear cushions in 2 different colors with a bag which i probably won't use.
they fit comfortably in my ears and i am satisfied with the sound isolation as well.
"i have nothing bad to say about the nrg 2.0, but i do hope they last a long time."
"oh, but wait, they have a 1 year warranty which is a nice bonus."
edit: after 6 months of use i am sure with my previous review.
the headphone had broken into two on regular usage.
please check the pictures.
first review ->i would rate nrg 1.0 version a 5 star.
this second version has disappointed me a little bit.
i really loved the strong nylon cable of the prior version.
"this new innovative shield cable, basically just seems like a thick plastic cable."
i am not sure if this will be as durable as the previous version.
why change something which was working awesome?
"very warm soundnot boomy bass or peaky treble, but quite clear (lacks ~<80hz"
"and ~>15khz, by ear)well made, strong cord and connections90 headphone plug is very useful for longevity against fraydon't insert very far into ears"
so sometimes require adjustment to not block sound (especially if westing under a helmet)
"for those who use the average apple, samsung, or even beats, you will hear a significant difference in sound quality with these, don't let the packaging fool you, they spend all their funds on quality headphones, no flashy stuff."
you will hear subtle sounds
"the average, heavy bass, headphones will block out."
truely worth every penny.
"not 5 stars because 5 is a perfect product, while i still search for the perfect product, this is a close second."
"would recommend,also be careful,"
"last ones i had, the jack broke because i accidentally lifted my hand to quickly and  ripped it out of my laptop, having half the jack stuck in my laptop."
but that's my fault not the product

but that's my fault not the product
amazing!!  
i have a lot to compare it to.  
i had gone to my tribecca headphones as my ear jax had gone out.  
i use with my mp3 player.  
the difference between these and the tribecca was amazing and no comparison to the ear jax
and i had the expensive ones.  
"the wood is cool, the ear cushions that it came with are immediately comfortable.  "
the wires seem really heavy duty (who knows i just got them).  
it comes in a burlalp sac thing which i don't prefer.  
i will keep them in my ear jax holder.
the sound quality is the best thing about these buds.
"next i would say is style, but that's where it stops."
the rubber ear inserts don't sit well in the ear canal.  
"the wire is long and heavy, and you can hear it rubbing/bumping on your clothes."
have bought and used a number of these ear buds in the past.
i like them and think the sound is excellent from them.
however they crap out after heavy use and the angled connector tends to get kinked or damaged easily
"and then they cut out or only one bud works at a time,"
by then they are out of warranty.
"this last pair i bought was a bait and switch as i prefer the cord to be fabric wrapped which was shown in the pictures and no mention in listing about cord material, and these came with a tough plastic covering (disappointing :( )"
oh well maybe they will hold up longer.
overall a decent product for the money.
not sure if the wood adds to the sound quality but the aesthetics of the different colored wood is nice.
sound great for he price and durable.
i just can't get these types of earbuds to stay in my ear very well.
i use over ear headphones always at home
but i needed something for school last year
and i got these.
sound great with surprising bass when they are in and have a seal
but that doesn't last long for me
so im selling them to a friend for $10 tomorrow.
i ordered the samsung galaxy s7 earbuds because they stay in better an don't friend likes their sound and bass.
these headphones look as good as they sound...
amazing.
the only reason i am only leaving 4 stars is the cable is wrapped in some type of plastic.
the photos make it look like a braided cable and the plastic is not what i was expecting.
the plastic also makes it difficult to flex and they tend to sit in uncomfortable positions when i have them under my shirt when i work out.
"other than this, these headphones are fantastic, especially for the price."
"great earbuds, well worth the investmenti bought another pair just so i would have extras."
update -
the sound in these are just superb!
"i just bought a third pair, i have listened and purchased solo many earbuds, bose and many of the supposed best, for much more money."
"these are superior to them, only wish they had volume controls built in, but the mic is top of the line and the speakers / frequency response is second to none!"
i was looking for new earbuds and these looked both aesthetically pleasing and had excellent reviews
so i went ahead and purchased them.
they worked alright for about a month and then shorted out on me.
"one thing i did notice while they were working is that while i was walking while wearing them, you could hear the wires hit against your coat and it was distracting."
"all in all, i am disappointed in these earbuds and will be looking for another product to replace them."
edit:
"a month after publishing this review i was contacted by a symphonized representative, who offered to ship me a new pair of earbuds along with a ""shirt clip."
""" i received the new pair in the mail, and have no had any issues with interference."
"so far, these headphones are working great as well."
"so props to symphonized for the great customer service, and i appreciate them rectifying this situation."
"decent buds, i would give them 3.5 but since that's not an option i'll be generous and round up."
"nice bass, that's the best thing about these but"
for the money really can't go wrong anyways.
my biggest complaint about these headphones is the white noise when the volume is low.  
if you are looking for buds for listening to a book i would stay away from these.
great sound but fell apart at the ear
bud less than 3 months after purchase.
update:was sent a replacement pair that have been working well.
sometimes you get a faulty item
and it's nobodies fault.
the company replaced them free of charge and made it right.
so far so good.
it's been a month of use with no problems!
headphones were quite decent for about a week and then one of the earphones seemingly died and is making this horrible white noise sound.
then after powering through that some how the coupling the holds
the silicone in place came lose and rendered that earbud useless as it isnt comfortable without the silicone piece of course.
besides that i loved the headphone just wish they would have lasted longer than a week for the price.
very pleasant sound.
bass is distinct but not overemphasized.
high frequencies are slightly muffled.
singers/voices come through very well.
cable noise is not bad.
"i gave it only 4 stars because sound isolation is not great, it is not the ear cups"
but i think it is the open grille they have on the outer edge.
this is a bit of a problem for me since i want to block out noisy coworkers and airplane noise.
a very good product for the price (like it better than a $45 s0 i recently returned)
i decided to try symphonized headphones after my umteenth paper of skullcandy headphones quit on me.
i wear my headphones constantly.
"between my bus commute and day in the office, i'm literally listening to music on my phone for almost 12 hours a day."
"after five months of this kind of use, i have my first complaint."
"because i wear headphones at work, i am frequently taking then out of my ears to hear someone speaking to me."
"last week, one of my earbuds came apart!"
"at the point where there is a silver ring behind the marshmallow, there is actually a seam where two pieces of wood are glued together."
"now, mine came apart there, but the wires were still intact."
i made an emergency run for some superglue and (hooray!)
everything is wonderful again.
i look forward to many more months of excellent sound quality and highly recommend these headphones for anyone who listens to a lot of music.
i bought these ear buds for work
and i couldn't be happier!  
they sound absolutely amazing from the highs to the low bass.  
by far these are the nicest pair of ear buds i have owned.  
my initial impression was that these are high quality.  
the wires are more thick than most and have a rubberized coating.  
the headphone jack does not stick straight out nor does it bend easily.
they look great and they had many style colors to choose from.  
there was three ear fittings to choose from and i noticed this plays a major role is how good the music sounds.  
if they fitting is too small they do not sound as good.  
"so, try the different ear fittings."
i have already had 3 of my co-workers buy a pair
and they just as pleased as i am.
"unfortunately, one of the ear buds started to come apart after 4 months of use.  "
i emailed customer service that day and got a response within a few hours.  
they backed their product 100%
and i couldn't be happier
they way i was treated.  
"they were prompt, professional, and replaced them with no hassle."
earpiece separated only after 4 months of normal use.
right behind the sliver band.
hopefully the seller will see this review and replace the product for me.
i called customer service # for symphonized on 6/1/16 and they offer a 1 year warranty for this product.?
they are sending a replacement.
let's see if the product holds up.
"i do agree , these phones sound good, yet quality is important."
thank you symphonized!
"😊so far, after a couple of weeks, the replacements have been holding up."
"i must admit, these sound really good for the money."
time will tell.
"i have a pair of these myself, and when my granddaughter wanted earbuds for her birthday"
i picked out the pair with the turquoise wiring.  
"she loved them, and was impressed they were made from wood.  "
"by the way, they have great sound and very sturdy wiring."
great quality and value.
good noise isolation.  
the frequency response on these is 18 hz to 22 khz (why is this not stated in the description?).
my only complaint is that the audio jack protrudes way too far out.  
"my previous sony mdr-ex71sl (bought in 2004, 6 hz - 23 khz, held up for 12 years!)"
had 90 degree angled jack to be fairly flush with whatever it's plugged into.
sony continues to deliver 90 degree jacks with the comparable mdr-ex150ip model which has a 5 hz to 24 khz.  
"the frequency response is no big deal, most people won't be able to actually hear the very low and very high frequencies anyway, but that 90 degree angled connector ..."
", perhaps i am too picky and will get used to the nrg 2.0 sticking out a good inch."
great little earbuds.
sound is more balanced vs. many buds in this price category that produce a v-shaped sound signature.
lows are nice and smooth and not overwhelming.
"noise cancellation is ok but not as good as some other buds, can probably be improved using different ear tips."
time will tell how these hold up.----update:these fell apart after 10 months of light use.
tried to superglue them back
but it didn't last a week.
this is my second pair of symphonized nrg 2.0 headphones.
"the first pair still work great, and i chose to buy a second set to have a back up."
the cord is long enough that i can listen to either mobile devices or my computer in comfort.
the sound quality is clear with deep base and good treble balance
"(no ""tinny"" sounds that you can get with cheaper headphones), and in the year i've had the first pair, has not diminished over time."
"these are also my favorite phone headset for the same reason, as the mic quality is also great."
i will definitely be buying more from symphonized in the future.
these headphones sound great!  
they have a nice rich bass sound that mixes well with the trebles.
fit nicely in my ear.
they are not for workouts though as they easily come out when doing a lot of movement.
"i bought a pair of the alns also, which i sent back because the bass was nonexistent in them."
but if you want a reasonably priced pair of great sounding earphones with nice bass and sound isolation these nrg 2.0s are the way to go.
i love these headphones.
i am notoriously rough with my headphones and these are going strong months later even including an accidental run through the washer.
"i love the coating on the cords, it seems to help protect it alot."
another great feature is where it plugs into the device is slightly bent
so you are able to wind the headphones around your phone with ought damaging the cord where it plugs into the phone
:)
i plan on getting some of these as stocking stuffers for christmas this year!
these headphones are very different from any others that i've purchased in the past.
they were my first pair of wooden headphones.
i read the reviews and was a little hesitant because of the comments about being able to hear the noise if the cords rub against something.  
"i've experienced what those comments were talking about, however, it does not take away from the beautiful sounds that can be heard with these earphones."
i would definitely purchase them again.
"i purchased the original nrg's on a whim over 2 years ago, on cyber monday."
"i'm an audio engineer, so good sound quality and reproduction is important to me; but, i also beat the s"
*
"** out of headphones, and tend to abuse earbuds, so i search for these qualities without breaking the bank."
"those headphones astounded me right out of the box, and lasted up until 2 months ago when the wire finally snapped."
i purchased the new nrg's on friday and received them on monday.
"once again, straight out of the box, the bass and low mid range on these headphones is full and rich."
they kick well for their size and have a great warmth without getting muddy.
"the mid-mids aren't perfectly articulated, and can get a little quacky at high volumes with certain genres of music, but the highs are beautifully crisp and have a ton of air."
the important thing in these headphones is the sound stage.
"these are the widest earbuds i've ever owned, of some 4 dozen models over the years."
"ambient music, post rock, emo, and metal"
"especially all sound fantastic and rich in these phones, and every other genre i've tried has sounded pretty great, too."
"i strongly recommend these headphones at the price point, and even up to the 75$ price point, where klipsch gives them a serious run for their money."
"these make a great gift, too!"
i bought these for my daughter to listen to music with.
i did not purchase the protection plans and they broke at 2 months old.
i emailed symphonized and they replaced them for me at no charge and said if i have any other problems to please contact them.
"great customer service,  they made me feel like a valued customer."
thank you kara!
i did have a slight malfunction with this product.
however by contacting customer support for this product.
i was immediately satisfied with the purchase of these headphones.
not only do you get a pair of headphones that have extraordinary sound.
i do mean extraordinary for the range of sound from high to low.
you honestly get some of the finest customer support you will ever come across.
i highly recommend this product.
these earbuds cancel out most external noise.
i wear them on the train to work and can focus on my music or podcasts without distraction.
"they fit comfortably in the ear, or as comfortable as earbuds can be."
"the only downside is that there is no inline volume or track control, which makes it difficult to use these while working out or if i want to keep my phone tucked away in a jacket."
"the ""wood"" aspect seems to be more of a marketing gimmick than anything musically enhancing."
"they're aesthetically nice for the price although i've experienced the same thing some others have complained about, that is the glue failing along the thin metallic ring between the bud and the cable, causing the earpiece to fall apart unless re-glued."
sound-wise
they're not bad
but i have a $23 pair of adax earbuds that sound slightly more enriching in both highs and lows.
these are nice-backups
but i wouldn't use them as my primaries.
i was really let down by my first impression with this product's quality: the first day i wore them
i noticed the sound cutting in and out as i walked around with them in my chest pocket.
"i would understand if i had these headphones for over a year, but not on literally the first day of use."
"it's a shame, because i love their over-ear headphones, but these seem to be lacking the quality of pairs of $9.99 headphones i've bought in the past."
"i'm returning this pair for another because i believe this might just be a defective pair, but posting a negative review as i'm upset that this is all occurring on the first day of wear."
"i love the look of these, and the sound quality is excellent."
what impressed me the most was the sound canceling ability!
"having used earbuds before, i know that they usually do some job of blocking outside sound, but these are just one or two steps below actual earplugs."
an unexpected bonus.
"they don't look, feel or sound cheap at all."
i really like them.
these we bought and used immediately after receiving on a 10 hr trip.
i was pleasantly surprised by how good they sounded for the money spent.
"after the trip, i may have used them one other time for a couple hours but for most of the last two months they've remained stored in its included storage bag."
a couple of days ago i tried using them and noticed the left earbud kept going out.
i pinpointed the cause to be in the wiring near or inside the plug tip.
any slight movement or rotation had
the left ear going out constantly.
i remember reading before purchasing a few others experiencing the same thing but due to the overwhelming positive reviews i bought.
"on a side note, the first pair i purchased was damaged during shipping and this was the replacement pair."
i will not be purchasing from this company again.
i've already started the return process.
two stars for the fact that they sounded good.
just wish they would've lasted longer than 15 hrs of total use.
"considering the rave reviews i read on these earbuds, i was a bit disappointed at the quality of the cables of this product.  "
"the sound is good, and that's why i bought it, but the wires are very light and feel flimsy.  "
"they look much stronger in the product images, but they don't feel substantial like they were built to last.  "
we'll see how long this product does last.
"thanks to several adaptive-fit pieces included, these earbuds seal in ear canal, acoustic qualities are noticeable from any pair i've used before, no tangle cord doesn't tangle (doesn't hang like usual cords either), various cord colors and wood tones to choose from.. ..."
just wow!!
♡
i've bought at least three different wired ear buds -
one set
i gave away that cost more recently.
"i just got these, and man was i blown away !"
"when they promised solid bass response, they weren't kidding!"
these are the best sounding ear buds i've ever used.
"if they last, symphonized should be crowned king of wired ear buds."
these are super good for the price.
they isolate noise from the outside well.
the sound isn't the best ever but is probably the best i've heard in this price range.
make sure you try all of the different sizes it comes with.
they look really cool and seem solid like they won't break.
update:lost my first pair.
liked them so much i bought another.
can't believe they are as cheap as they are.
after you burn them in a little they sound even better.
"they look great, but the left channel was half-dead right out of the box.*updated"
04/07/17 - symphonized followed up with a replacement pair that were a definite improvement over the originals.
"aesthetically, i love the wood and the braided cord."
"the sound is good, perhaps a bit bass-heavy, although i may just be used to a previous pair of sennheisers."
"the provided sizing options give a nice, snug fit and block out more outside noise than i would have expected."
"good ear buds for the office, although there is a respectable amount of ""cord noise"" when moving, so probably not the best for the gym."
gave these set five stars because the sound is beyond pleasing for the low price.
i have been buying head/earphones for awhile and these are by far the best sounding ones.
"i purchased a pair last year( the red ones too) and i loved them, they were the prior version and to be honest i liked the cord much better, i know they had to changed it for porpuses of better quality etc, but the new version in red doesn't look as flattering as the other material."
i should have gotten black or even the metal color.
but i am more than satisfied with the sound.
yesterday on my way to work i was playing paul kalkbrenner to make sure the bass was on point.
and within seconds i knew these set was working to its fullest.
metal sounds great and pretty much anything with bass.
i can't help comment on how great the bass works
", it's sharp and it takes your music to another level, specially if you listen to, wav, aiff, flac files on your device."
go get them and enjoy your music.
bless you all.
the only earbuds that i will use now.  
"my pair has held up well under heavy use, and i have given three pairs"
away-  
all still going strong.  
"much better sound than most earbuds, and made to last.  "
"the long, tough cord is great, and having extra earpieces in different sizes is a nice touch."
"the sound is equally good for music, streaming movies, and spoken word podcasts."
these wooden earbuds are quite unique
so i bought them for a friend who actually does wood work.  
he appreciated the quality of both the construction and the wood finish and continues to comment that they have great sound
and he enjoys using them every day (6 months so far with no issues).  
"considering the price point, they would be nice to buy simply for looks but the sound is good quality as well.  "
i considered buying myself a pair but decided on the over-the-ear style instead.
good quality for maybe 3 weeks then earbuds separated into 3 pieces and 3 days later were unusable.
buy these if you like disappointment
"honestly, i have tried about 17 different pairs of earbuds and these are by far the best."
"they are comfortable, stylish and the sound is phenomenal."
"ive tried expensive bose and beats earbuds, and the sound quality on these are a lot nicer."
"i would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an inexpensive, yet high-quality earbuds."
this product is hands down the best i've ever owned.
the sound quality is outstanding and the  design is simply beautiful.
"over the last two decades, i've gone through hundreds of earphones, but never been 100% satisfied with any of them."
"if the sound quality was good, then they hurt my ears."
"i've worn these for hours, and never experienced any discomfort.  "
my search is done.
i will never own another brand again.
this is my second pair of these earbuds.
i ordered these when i thought i lost my first pair
and i realized how much i missed them.
great sound at an excellent price.
it looks like they've made some improvements since my first pair.
the wires are now coated with plastic so there is less noise from them and the silicon earpads appear to be a higher quality material.
i am buying a third set for my wife so that she will stop using mine.
good sound is the reason this got 4 stars.  
good looking buds.  
the cable is a pain in the a#%.  
it will not relax.  
it still has the same kinks in it from when it came out of the box.  
even after i hung them out in the sun here in oklahoma.
update 7/16.
"the company reached out to me to find out specifics of how the earbuds failed, and quickly sent me a new pair."
"they do seriously try to keep their customers satisfied, and this is much appreciated."
"since the sound quality is really very good and the company sent me a replacement, i'm happy to improve this rating."
"if the replacement lasts well, i will raise my rating all the way."
i love these things.  
i accidentally ran mime through the washer several times and they were still functioning as new.
i had a pair for a year before they got a short at the top of the foot where they plug in.
i wear these things in my motorcycle inner a bunch of cold weather gear and when i'm hiking.
the sound is phenomenal.
deep bass and high pitch crisp sound quality.
i just ordered 3 new pairs.
i didn’t expect a good sound to come from these because usually i go for the bigger brand names.
"so i heard of this brand, and decided to try it."
"i was amazed of how epic these sounded, it was listening to a pair of bose earbuds but at a cheaper cost."
i would buy these again in a heartbeat.
"these are really attractive, sophisticated looking earbuds that are also well designed acoustically and actually block out environmental sounds very well."
the variety of silicone ear canal tips is also a great feature when you need two different sizes (who knew).
"there is a bit of line noise when the cord rubs against clothing or itself, but these are not the type of gear one would take running, hiking or for heavy activity."
"symphonized nrg 2.0 earphones are great for commuters, office work use, light activity listening, traveling or other casual entertainment with good ambient noise reduction without being bulky and over-the head."
"i  used them successfully with lg, phone, macbook, i-pod, and i-phone audio: they are terrific for cell-phone conversation use and the pause/mute toggle in-line is very reliable on all functions.  "
they are well worth the price.
great ear buds at a great price.
bought for my teen daughter to use in the hospital during 17-day stay for epilepsy monitoring.
"she could not wear her beats over-ear headphones due to the eegs and head-wrappings, and she's a huge music lover."
used them with her iphone 6.
"she reports that the sound quality was every bit as good as beats, plus no tangling of wires."
i am no audiophile.
"i don't exactly know how to review these headphones on a sonic basis, but i can at least say they sound just fine for me."
i haven't noticed any tinniness or any muffling.
i mostly use these for music and podcast playing while at my office job.
i take them on walks as well.
"the build quality is pretty darn good, and their wiring and cuffing leading into the earpiece leaves them feeling much sturdier than many other earbuds."
"i usually have a problem right at this connection that leads to a ruined pair, which i don't think i have to worry about with these."
"anyway, i think a lot of people will be buying these for aesthetic reasons."
"they're just really nice looking headphones, and bring style to a product that normally doesn't even try."
"sturdy, sharp, and affordable."
i'm pretty satisfied.
bought these due to high customer feedback.
"i was very dubious of the supposed $99.99 sales price, marked down to about $26.00 when i purchased them."
"these are pretty high fidelity headphones, with very clear sound, but a big warning  to any prospective buyers, these headphones have no bass."
like
literally zero bass.
"i wanted headphones with clearer sound than my old iphone headphones, and i wanted headphones not made out of tissue paper and the world's cheapest rubber like my old iphone headphones."
and these are clearly much more quality material.
but i cannot stress enough: no.
bass.
at all.
"very expensive, very clear,  very tinny headphones."
tinnier than rin-tin-tin on a hot tin roof.
i'm pretty angry.
"sound quality is ok at best, they dont stay in my ears cuz they weigh so much due to the cabel being braided and glossed, the sound quality is minimal, highs are"
"decent sounding bass is minimal, mids are hard to hear, they do sound like a step or 2 better than the panasonic ear drops though, the color of the wire is metalic and will shine in the sun, and i only use these in the sun"
so i didnt like that
"sound quality is ok at best, they dont stay in my ears cuz they weigh so much due to the cabel being braided and glossed, the sound quality is minimal, highs are"
"decent sounding bass is minimal, mids are hard to hear, they do sound like a step or 2 better than the panasonic ear drops though, the color of the wire is metalic and will shine in the sun, and i only use these in the sun"
so i didnt like that
this is my second set.
"i tried out a cheaper, well reviewed ""amazon best seller"" headphones for a short time and then bought my second set of these headphones."
now i regret it.
the first set and second set both have a problem staying in my ear.
"the wires are heavy enough that they tend to weigh down the headphones, making the headphones easy to pop out of my ears."
i've tried fitting the right size buds to tighten the fit.
these headphones are a huge disappointment.
i decided to pay extra for a set of headphones so they would last a long time
but they lasted less than 3 weeks.
i would strongly recommend to not buy them
"these did a good job sealing out outside sound and sounded great for their size, at least to my ear."
"however, two components of the headphone appear to be held together by glue, and the headphones came apart after about a year of use."
my other headphones are going strong after that length of time!
"after the wood components of the headphones came apart, one of the delicate electrical connections within the headphone itself appears to have been severed."
"i have not yet gone through customer support, and i suspect i can resolder and glue the headphones together myself."
"if i were to purchase one again, however, i would be very careful not to place too much mechanical stress on the headphones: be careful not to yank them out of the carrying case, store them in places where they may have weight on top of them, etc."
"having now used them for about a month, i have to say these are the best earbuds i have ever had."
"i bought 3 pairs, 2 of which i gave to 2 brothers of mine."
they are the avid music lovers and both have had nothing but great things to say!
fast and speedy delivery as well.
these are by far the best in ear headphones for the money!!  
they pump out awesome sound and are super comfortable.  
i just took them on a 13 hour flight and they were brilliant!  
my biggest issue on airplanes is that i always have to crank the volume to my headphones to drown out the sound of the airplane engines.  
"with these, that wasn't necessary!  "
i was able to listen to music at a normal volume and didn't hear the engines at all.  
they are almost like a noise canceling headphone in that sense.  
"awesome value, i would absolutely recommend!!!"
these are the best ear buds i've ever owned.
the sound is fantastic.
thick and full.
the fit is extremely comfortable.
the price is perfect.
the cord is a little longer then most so my ipod fits in my pocket without being stretched taught.  
the connection points are sturdy.
i don't use these on the phone
"so i couldn't tell you how well the mic works, but i would guess, from the quality of the rest of the product, that it would have no problems.  "
i chose this color because it was on sale
and i'm not really caught up in any kind of fashion statement
but they do have a nice selection of colors.  
i would buy these again.
"in fact, i know a couple people that will love getting these as a gift really soon."
i hadn’t realized what i’d been missing with other ear buds.
these bring out instruments i’d never heard before though i’d listened to the same music for a while.
"cool looking, too!"
complimented at the gym by someone much younger.
i purchased the original symphonized earbuds and liked them a lot except for the woven cloth covering over the cables making noisy sound as they rubbed against each other.
"symphonized listened and made this version 2.0 with a nylon or plastic covered cable reducing the noise substantially, while maintaining the excellent sound quality of the originals, still utilizing the same excellent qualities of wood sound chamber."
using these headphones are like having miniature quality speakers inside your ears!  
the bass response was unexpected.  
i listen to wagner and mahler most and the low sonorities come through like never before.  
they are also a great deal.
they come with three sizes of earplugs
so you can choose which are most comfortable.
i doubt if you'll be disappointed.
i bought these headphones after reading good reviews on the audio quality and i have to say that they sound good.
the build quality isn't as good though.
first problem is that the mic control isn't responsive on android.
i usually don't have a problem double tapping the mic button on my bose in ear headphones to skip songs but on these it's impossible.
"also, after a couple months of use the glue holding the in ear headphones attached to the wood canister deteriorates and the head phones fall out."
see pic.
"very comfortable earbuds, nice materials, and"
the sound is good.  
"however, i bought these for my wife"
"and she said that she does not like the extra long cords, that they get in the way during use of her cell phone.  "
"she is 5'-10"" and even with the phone carried in a jacket pocket, the cords are too long for her.  "
i guess they would be great for an nba star.
my boyfriend loves music and is definitely an audiophile.
"i got these as a gift for him, and he says they're the best earbuds"
he's ever owned!!
"although i am giving it 5 stars i do have a bit of an issue, when i received the headset, the jack was slightly bent, this forces me to have that end angled in a specific direction to have the audio to both sides, otherwise, it only goes to one side..."
it is frustrating to have to keep it at the right angle at all times.
if it's at all possible to receive a replacement set that would be nice.
"all and all if the audio is the same as a normal working pair, then these are really great for quality.."
"if i can't get a replacement set for the problem i have, then might just buy againedit: i have received a new pair of headphones and mentioned before they are very good audio wise and quality...."
"if anything happens to these outside the 1 year warranty, i will defiantly buy again!"
great headphones.
the sound quality compared to others in this price range is great.
it reveals sounds that are lost with cheaper headphones.
"theyre comfortable, look nice, sound great, and feel very durable."
the angled chord is a nice feature as well.
ordering them for some family too!
"bought 2 of those for my wife and i, 6 months or so ago."
use them almost every day on the subway and sometimes the plane.
very happy about them for the value.
pros: great sound and bass for the price
"(i listen mostly to pop and rock), good noise isolation from the external world, in the subway or the plane."
in a plane i'll use them instead of foam earplugs
so i have less stuff to worry about.
i wouldn't mind get higher end ones but those are really perfect at this price point.
the transport bag is cute too.
cables don't entangle too much.
cons: the cables are a bit noisy when walking.
i've also lost one bud but replaced it.
no audio controls on the cables (as expected).
let me start off by saying these earphones sound great.
they're one of the best headphones you can get for the price.
they're definitely up there with the likes of the sony extra bass headphones.
"the headphones have good bass, a decent soundstage, and vocals sound good too."
"on top of that, they have a unique design that stands out from your everyday apple/samsung oem provided earphones."
"my only problem came when the wire stopped working two months after i bought them, which really disappointed me because they were a great pair of earphones.  "
the wire only works if i hold it at an awkward position.
"apart from this, i would rate these 5 stars, but due to durability issues, i can't really do that."
first: the sound quality is exceptional in my opinion.
the only time i get sound cancellation and fidelity
this good is with a set of $150 ear-cup headphones.
i don't know that i could go back to a my previous go-to on earbuds after owning these.
second: comfort.
the shape is unobtrusive and the silicone rubber fills the space without being stiff or uncomfortable.
the rubber cups are comfortable enough i take the extras (they give you multiple sizes and a plain black or accented version of each size) and put them on my workout headphones.
end of story.
the cord is long and heavy; it pulls the ear buds down and constantly coils up and wraps around everything.
the sound is like a tin can.
if any pressure is put on the cord at all (i tucked it under my keyboard) - the sound gets muffled and/or warped.
"really disappointed in these, especially for the price."
"also, it cost me $7 to return them plus the price of packaging"
"- so, one third of the buying price."
ugh.
i buy these for my dad every year for father's day.
he still has the first set i purchase a few years back
", i just like to get him new ones."
"although a little more expensive for ear buds, these are worth it."
they last a long time and have high quality sound.
i also love the look and colors available.
not long after buying these i wrote a review basically saying cheap earbuds can be better.  
after using these for quite some time i realized i couldn't be more wrong.  
the sound these produce is crystal clear and accurate.  
more than once i've heard things in music i've been listening to for years that i've never heard before.  
i'm not sure why the price is so low when they could charge more.
another thing i like is the cable rarely ever gets tangled.  
"sometimes they will get a little wrapped up in themselves if they've been in my pocket for a while, but i never spend more than a few seconds straightening them out."
"one thing i wish they had was volume control, but now i see there is a 3rd version that has just that."
these were earphones i favored.
but i had to go looking for other brands since it would last less than a year.
6 months and would fall apart and one ear bud would stop working.
these sound good
but they hurt my ears even after trying different buds for a week.
also sound travels really well through the cable if it’s touched which sucked for me at the gym where i like to run the cable under my shirt.
returned.
"i am not an expert in sound technology terminology, but i can confidently say i love these ear-phones.  "
i think the wood gives it a quality look as well as making it a solid unit.  
"i'm not going to go into the range of sounds etc., etc.  "
these replaced a more expensive pair that fell apart after a couple of months.  
"the value of these, the sound and the quality of the workmanship is first grade."
these will last for a year at most.
and my current pair will be my last.
"since the jack broke off in my mobile phone, they will be the last."
i bought these a few months ago to replace my bose earbuds that had begun fraying along the length of the cord.
"the sound quality isn't as good as the bose, but i suppose that is to be expected based on the difference in price point."
my main problem with these is that the sound in one earbud has already gone out!
i can now only hear out of one side.
"i'm a responsible adult, so i haven't dropped them in water, thrown them off a cliff, or let my dog chew on them."
i use them and then gently put them back in the bag...but they still crapped out on me.
pathetic.
would not recommend.
i’ve bought two.
"one i owned for 4 years, the light brown wood with the cloth covered black and white cording."
"loved them, lasted for 4 years before breakin, infact i just glued to housing to the earbud together"
and they still work
and i’m going to continue to use them.
however these ones with the purple cord are awful.
the cord is so ridged
"i almost don’t want to use them, they get caught on everything and continue after a week of wear to try and wrap back to how they fit in the packaging."
the most unbelievable sound coming through the little plugs.
everyone who listens to music through these earplugs are amazed at the sound.
"wish i had these a long time ago, then i would have listened to 10 x’s the music as i have."
"by this time,i've purchased,marveled at, and given out to my family, friends, and even neighbors, so many symphonized products,they should hire me!!"
"excellent products, excellent prices and excellent customer service !!"
"hopefully they will make it big in this very crowded market, i know they have my vote !!"
"and by the way, i have always paid full price for everything !"
"i am not a ""reviewer"" or any kind of shill for the company;just a very pleased consumer.so"
this was the second time that i ordered these symphonized ear buds.  
the sound quality is amazing and for the price you can't find a better sounding set.  
"however, both of the times i made my purchase either one or both sides of the ear buds have stopped working.  "
if you're looking for a great sounding set that will last 1-3 months of heavy use these are great.  
"but, if you are expecting these to last more than 6 months they probably won't."
"bought these earbuds to wear when riding my motorcycle, and because it they were supposed to provide a ""crisp powerful acoustic sound with strong deep bass."""
but they don't fit well
"(tried all 3 sizes) and don't form a good seal, there is no strong deep bass sound, and do not cancel any noise."
not worth $25.
"the packaging was lovely, but that doesn't help with the poor sound quality."
"meh, they work but"
i don't much like the sound.
"it might be what other people like, but it's definitely changing it a bit so not my bag."
they are very pretty.
they don't stay in my ears
well either regardless of the plug put on.
they seem well made but don't work for me.
the cord noise is atrocious.
"if i so much as turn my head, the noise that i hear in my ears is that of the cord rubbing, even slightly, on whatever it touches."
"after reading other reviews, i thought that this issue would be resolved in the 2nd generation."
i bought these for a simple headphone for editing the sound of video projects.
"i need to be able to hear subtle and quiet sounds, and the cord noise makes that very difficult."
i have to consciously put in the effort to stay as still as possible during my editing.
very annoying.
"i tried to give them time to see if i got used to the problem, but i haven't."
"i would return them if i could, but that time has passed."
sound and comfort are good.
i should have read through q/
a section better though because there is no volume control.
i think the product description good be more forthcoming however.
there is no mention that there is the pause/skip function.
i mistakenly assumed from pictures that there was volume control.
my bad.
"i also found it kind of funny that the included instructions say not to wrap headphones around your device, but the included bag is smaller than most devices."
the bag is is way to small to be be functional or useful.
i got them on sale for $25
"so i'm not overly disappointed, but was expecting more from $50 retail headphones."
i bought these last november and love them.  
"they fit my ears really well, which actually isolates noise.  "
the mic works very well for phone conversations.  
the bass is great and the sound quality is solid.  
maybe not the crisp and clear sound you get from a high end
headphone
but you won't notice it because you wallet didn't have to cough up your whole paycheck.  
great headphones for the price and quality!!  
i should add wife
and i both have a pair.  
she is a big fan too.
i'm no audiophile
"but i do have a thing for ear buds and headphones, especially wooden."
"just received these so not yet broken in and can't address durability but love them, esp."
for $25...sound and build quality seems good and the flexible metallic cords don't tangle which is a real bonus.
"okay, so when i first saw these headphones i was so excited!"
"the wood finish was so cool, and all i saw was great reviews, so i decided to spend 26$ on these pair of headphones on november 6th 2015.  "
"when i got them, they came in a very professional box and the carrying case was so neat."
i was very happy with my order for the first two weeks!  
"but then i noticed on the right earbud, where the metal strap is that connects the base of the headphone to the rubber buds connect"
was commected with glue which was starting to wear off.
i didn't really mind that because it wasn't too bad and the headphone still worked.
"i thought about calling in and seeing what i should do, but i didn't."
"it is now january 10th, 2016 and"
the right headphone is breaking completely.
the glue is almost not even present and the sound sounds very muffled when i try to play my anything.  
"i have called customer service, and so far no response."
"it was a very cool purchase, but in the end i am not a happy camper."
hopefully symphonized will fix my problem and i can remove all the frustration about this from my head.  
i have enclosed pictures so you can see what part is falling out.
i purchased these headphones not too long ago in silver.
i loved the sound and the noise cancelling was an advantage for me.
but soon after the left ear bud stopped working.
i never placed these headphones in a condition where it would damage it
i even used the bag that came with the box to protect it as well.
i am very disappointed because for the price it should not have occurred this soon after my purchase.
besides that the item i sjust as described.
there are a few problems with these...
first thing i noticed was the noise in the headphones when i moved.
the wires are stiff and make a crinkling noise with every movement.
rather maddening.
"second, most of the people i tried to talk to through these complained they could not understand me because of noise."
i gave up using them and went back to a mangle pair of iphone earbuds.
very disappointing because they look great.
"if you have a cheap music player, buy this."
"if not go to zagg.com, and the $59.99 zr-six earphones for a real jump in sound quality."
jump up to the bose earphones in the $100.00 rang and you will be blown away.
stay away from their top of the line model ($250 +/_).
it has an internal battery that can not be replaced.
you make the choice.
i am returning these.
they sound great and all
but they’re literally the most annoying earphones i’ve ever owned.
the wires are really heavy compared to the earphone itself
so the wires constantly pull them out of your ears.
the earphones aren’t a great shape so even without the added weight of the wires they just pop out of your ears (i’ve tried all of the sizes it doesn’t change anything).
the wires are too stiff to wrap around your ears so that doesn’t work either.
they just won’t stay in my ears.
i’ve
almost rage destroyed them a dozen times out of frustration from constantly putting them back in
second pair - both failed after about a month or two.
"had very high hopes - great sound, but then the input jack would cause a lot of static, even disconnect calls."
thought my iphone 6s was messed up - but my old and new sony headsets do not have the same problem.
i tossed both of these symphonized sets into the trash.
this is the second pair i have purchased because i loved how comfortable they were and how good quality the sound was
"excellent quality, highly detailed sound, perfect for watching amazon video when you're getting a little older and have listened to way too much loud rock music in your youth."
i love the look of the cables and the wood.
i use them at work every day to block out ambient noise and conversations in a cubicle environment.
i would purchase these again.
lasted from june 25 thru aug 4 - 40 days of use before failure is unacceptable reliability.
"update to original review (august 18, 2016)..."
symphonized customer service gets kudos...
a call to them resulted in a replacement unit being sent out immediately.
"i now have the new set, it is working"
well - long term reliability is still unknown; i'm hoping that the first unit was a fluke and this new one will last.
i've upgraded my rating from one to three stars based on the responsiveness of symphonized customer service.
"well, i've had to revise my rating again..."
"the replacements failed, i bought another symphonized head set,"
it failed after one month and symphonized won't
"honor the warranty, claiming it was sold by ""a third party seller on amazon"" - it was sold ""by amazon"", hardly a third party.  "
"just another company making shoddy products and failing to stand behind their workmanship (or lack thereof).unacceptable, symphonized."
i have been very pleased with these earbuds.
i have owned several pairs.
work fine and seem to last well
(i don't expect earbuds to last more than 2 years).
i use them primarily for work.
i had a issue with one pair and customer service was very accommodating
and i will buy more.
i think i must have weirdly shaped ear canals because i can never find earbuds that stay in my ears.
thankfully these do.
"i only listen to spoken word with these earbuds,"
so can't comment on how music sounds through them.
spoken word sounds excellent through them.
my only complaint is that the cords tangle horribly when they are in my purse.
i bought these headphones to replace a $200 headset at work.
"these were cheap and had good ratings, so why not try '"
"em?well, i was not disappointed."
"they look great, the sound quality is perfect, and the audio quality coming from the wired microphone is astounding."
great value on a fantastic pair of headphones.
even though the cord looks like a woven material it is heavily plastic coasted and becomes tangled easy and is unmanageable.  
but the sound is amazing!  
i loved the sound so much i gave these to my son and bought the hot pink option which actually has a cloth woven cord.  
the cloth covered cord is a huge difference
and i am glad i had enough money to buy a better option.
i bought these as a gift for my wife to replace an earlier pair of symphonized nrgs' they are a great middle ground wired headphone.
not the fanciest headphones ever but definitely more than worth the price.
she loves them and is super happy gotta love it when you can make the wife happy.
you can't go wrong with these
it is one of thoes rare items that are better than their price.
this is my second pair of headphones from symphonized.
"i put the first pair through hell for the three years that i owned them, but they held up really well."
"for the value, i think they're unbeatable."
the new cord makes me hopeful that this set will be even sturdier.
"i love these headphones for the sound, for the microphone option (though occasionally i wish it also had volume control buttons), and for the multitude of earbud sizes, though i always use the smallest one."
"for everyday headphones, these rock."
"i ordered this product thinking that the cable is fabric, but it is plastic."
the quality of the material is really low.
"and also it is not comfortable in the ear, does not stay."
i tried different tops but each gives the same uncomfortable feeling.
i could send them back
but i was out of the country for more than a month
so i can't anymore
been using daily for the past 6 months and by far the better earbuds on the market.
received couple compliments on how it looks and the sound quality is fantastic for the price.
the cord also feels studier than most and have certainly gone through some wear and tear.
it's also very comfortable that sometimes i'll forget i'm wearing it.
would certainly recommend for regular use and commute as it does an excellent job at keeping noises out.
"would recommend leaving out in the sun to ""reform"" the wires as they tend to hold their packaged shape."
they are stiff which is a benefit to net getting tangled.
"noise canceling is good for my ear shape, quality is ok."
amazing earbuds!
so far the quality has been astounding for the price paid.
"although i'm not satisfied that the colored wood grain finish pictured, was not what i had received."
i received a lighter color wood on the back and a darker shade where the buds are
but i can easily overlook this since the quality is so good
and they are just for work to pass time anyways.
i am not an audiophile....
but i can state without questions
the combination of htc 10 and these phones make for a completely awesome sound experience.....
what i do know is you can spend a great deal of money on headphones....
"but given my comparison you can not do better, especially at this price point....."
"give them a try, you wont be disappointed...."
i had purchased the original symphonized nrg headphones and loved them but after about 10 months one of the ear pieces stopped working (which always seems to happen with my headphones).
when i was shopping for a new pair i decided to stick with this brand since i really liked the sound quality of the previous set.
"when the new headphones arrived i noticed an ""under warranty"" card that came with it"
and it dawned on me that my first pair was probably under warranty
so i emailed the company and within a few days they got back to me and are sending a replacement.
the warranty is good for 1 year (which isn't indicated on the card).
i was very pleased with their customer service.
i have owned many earbuds over the years and these have been on par with some of the best i have owned.
the interchangeable bud options are nice and i found a couple that worked for me.
for the price you can't beat them.
i have had them for a year and they are still going strong.
i have sweat in them as well and no issues.
these headphones sound amazing.
the bass is great with these and everything doesn't sound muddy.
"i was alittle worried when buying these for the price, i have to say though they were well worth it."
the only down side is when your moving and the cord rubs against you or anything of that nature
you'll hear it in your headphones.
other then that these are amazing!
i love these headphones.
they are great!
"they have great bass, they fit comfortably in my ears, they don't mess with the sound quality, and they work great with my iphone."
"i wish they had sound control on the cord, but i guess you can't have everything."
i am a bass fiend and these headphones have really good sound and great bass.
"as with other pictures/reviews here, the earbuds just popped apart because of really shitty adhesive holding the part together.  "
used them for about 2 1/2 months.
outlast apple earbuds
my daughter insists on original apple earbuds
no knockoffs
she knows the difference
but still they break with constant use until i got her these puppies.
i bought a pair on cyber monday what back in nov 2016
and they're still going strong
so i just got another pair for the ps4
cause i can't use the big sweaty over the ear things and the sound
is great
i'm impressed
maybe had them three months.
used them about a dozen times.
came apart at the ear bud.
the sound quality is better than your average ear buds.
"they aren't as teeny-tiny as say, skullcandy, but i do think they cut out outside noise a little better."
"so far, i'm happy with the clear sound."
it's like if you wanted to take a step up from the very cheap ones.
had great sound but the right earbud fell apart  
only thing holding it together is the wires inside the left earbud feels loose and has started to pop while i listen to my music not happy with my purchase
i expected these to last longer would like to get a replacement or refund
currently i do not recommend buying them
love these headphones
"so much- comfortable, blocks out noise and great price point."
"however, i've bought these 3 times now and they are breaking more and more frequently while getting more and more expensive."
(first ones i bought were like $17?
"now the ""3.0"" is $25???)"
bought these 6 months ago and one earbud already doesnt work.
a few months ago the speaker part detached from the base of the earbud (where the metal is) and i had to glue it back on...
i love these headphones!
i lost my original set and just bought the next one asap.
"they work well for me on a mildly-noisy commuter train, muffling most of the noise without having to blast my music."
i find them fairly comfortable and probably wear them for about 2 hours a day on weekdays.
i needed a replacement pair of earbuds after my last pair were stolen.
the pair that i lost were more expensive and i didn't have the money to spend this time around.
five stars hands down for these though.
these are keepers.  
i'm thoroughly happy with them especially for the price.
i have rather high standards and these babies met my expectations.
"the bass is heavy and rich, mids and highs are sufficient,  and i also noticed that i don't have to crank the volume as high."
"i only use them listening through my phone using spotify, while on the go."
exactly what i bought them for.
they're holding up well so far.
i'm happy!
i don't know if the wood makes a difference with sound quality
but they look good and more seem to be more durable than plastic.
"good job with these, guys."
these would get 5-stars if the wood didn’t break in the center of the bud.  
they are put together with glue
so they break and thus the wires separate and fail.  
they have a very short life.  
"but, never tangle up in my purse."
"they broke after about a month and a half of use, with the glue on the right earbud giving out as mentioned in some of the other reviews."
i contacted customer service and they were very prompt with response and getting me a replacement pair.
i love this brand and have bought them before
however it seems that as of late the quality has gone down in terms of construction.
i’d suggest a different brand if you don’t think you’d be willing to contact customer support if they break.
"i may not have the sophisticated hearing of others,with that said,i paid too much for this item."
"i kept them because i didn't pay attention and they were not a ""prime"" offer and the return would have cost me."
my bad.  
"also, they will not stay in my ears.  "
"yes, i tried the various sizes of buds.  "
just not a happy camper on this purchase.
"believe me, i tried to be."
"the nrg's were better right out of the box than i expected them to be, especially for the price.  "
break in period helped some more.  
i have cheaper ones that are unacceptable.  
"compared to a recently purchased similar priced pair, the nrg's are much better overall."
"base response is good and tight, not booming.  "
midrange response is good and highs are clear.  
i plug my headphones into a headphone amp preceded by a dac if the music source is pc based.  
for more serious listening
i use a pair of ath-m50x headphones.  
it is important to note that acceptability is subjective and music source is critical.  
i like the ngr 2.0's considering price and performance and would recommend trying them.
i really liked these headphones.
i had many mechanical problems with the previous version
so i tried the 2.0.
"well, sounded just as fantastic and my earpieces weren't falling apart like with the original nrgs."
"unfortunately, they've just proven to be more resilient."
"instead of breaking after a few months, they broke after about 11."
my left earpiece is beginning to go.
i don't think i can trust symphonized anymore.
update:
"excellent sound, trash housing."
for price you can't go wrong with these they provide good sound quality and they last a long time.
the wood ear piece tends to separate over time as the wood absorbs moisture
but i just glue it back together with elmer's wood glue.
the cord is great it doesn't short out like
most cheap buds do.
i recommend these.
it's really simple.  
these are the best earbuds i have ever owned
and i have owned a lot.  
why have i owned a lot of earbuds you ask?  
because they have all for the most part been crap.  
"so, i have been in the market for earbuds for about 15 years.  "
i bought these earbuds the same way i bought all the others.
"""how much do i want to pay for earbuds this time?""  "
when i got them i was blown away.  
there may be better earbuds (i guess) but not at this price.  
i will never buy another brand
and i am up to 4 pairs of these.  
1 was a replacement for a pair i broke and 3 for all the members of my family.  
who also love them!!
either i'm high or you all are.
the sound is terrible.
all treble ...
no bass.
also not very comfortable ...
ear buds don't form a good seal in the ear even though i have the smallest size on.
damn.
skull candy is way better sound ....
but for some reason causing random music play and audio skipping with my iphone7.
the search continues i guess
or i just need to replace the skull candy ones every couple of months ...
update to my review: the team reached out to me regarding my issue and promptly sent over replacement ear buds.
the new ear buds are amazing and much better than the original ones!
earphones feel much better now and sound so much crispier with a better fitting buds.
i am not a fussy listener
so find the overall sound quality to be very reasonable.
its nothing to get excited about but nothing that would bother someone as well.
the problem i have been having with these is the fitting of the ear plugs.
somehow they seen to fall off quite easily.
"compared with the similar products i have owned in the past, the earbuds feel very loose and even after trying all the sizes of the rubber plugs included in the package"
i have not been able to find the right size for me.
i think these headphones are pretty good.  
"i think the wood is kind of a gimmick, and not as important as other facets of the headphones"
(e.g. drivers).  
"however, they appear durable, the cable is extra thick and long, and sound quality is at least on par with other headphones at this price point."
they don’t stick in my ear very well
"and when they do, it acts as an ear plug and whatever"
i’m playing sounds muffled.
no good.
kinda mad.
"i really like these earbuds, but they could use more bass."
i like bass but not like bumping in a car.
these sound great
but i'm still looking for that pair that just absolutely booms.....
if you listen to peter gabriel or pink floyd don't expect the awesome bass you are used to hearing.
but these are great sounding
and i'm happy with my 23 dollar purchase.
i will keep these as a great backup pair because they're awesome quality
and i don't believe my kids can destroy them like they do my usually cheap pairs i've bought in the past
lol
i will buy them again after my kids destroy this pair and only one bud works.....
these are the best earbuds i've ever used.
"everything is clear and sharp, with an excellent bass range, all without the ""tinny"" or clipping of other earbuds."
the wood finish earbuds are beautiful.
"the braided steel (or whatever metal is happens to be) cord is sealed with a clear rubbery coating, making it very durable, and somewhat stiff (which i prefer because it seems to help keep them from getting in too much of a tangle)the cord tends to hold the loop from being in its nice little carry bag (small pouch, durable, good looking) but it doesn't bother me much."
i would absolutely buy this pair again if i needed another pair of earbuds.

"terrible, cheap headphones."
"the woodgrain covering began to detach from the base within the first month; i requested a new pair, and received that several weeks later."
"then, within maybe two months, these were coming apart as well."
the third request - for a refund - received one response from the comment.
"two subsequent follow-ups from me, and no response."
positive - decent sound quality & tangle free wire.
"negative - bad mic & as other reviewers have mentioned the wire makes too much noise while moving about, own"
"atleast 5 iems (bose, sennheisers, panasonic, soundmagic)"
this is the worst.
definitely not suitable for workouts/walks/jogs.
"great overall sound quality and some of the better bass out there, by far my favorite ear buds because while symphonized and other companies offer slightly better ones, none of them are as durable or well priced as these."
as a high school student on a budget and a rough life style i can stand by this.
these earbuds are flawless!
"stereo sound, great bass, cancels out some noise (i'm not an audio expert, warning, but i know what sounds tinny & horrendous & this is not cheap garbage.)"
"i kept these earbuds in my amz shopping cart for a year waiting to see if i caved & splurged on myself, & i'm thrilled that i did."
these things tangle up really bad.
there have been times i spend a minute or two untangling them.
it's very annoying.
another thing they are coated in a hard plastic so if they are folded too long
it's almost permanent.
i can't get them to straighten out.
sound is nice though
great headphones.
clear and concise sound and tangle free cords; plus they look cool.
this is my second set; one for home and one for the road.
i would definitely recommend these to anyone.
they come with 4 sets of earbuds
"so, fit is not an issue."
the one year warranty is just icing on the cake.
i bought these earbuds because they had decent reviews and had a slightly longer cord to reach to my computer on my desk at work.
"the cord is the right length (about 4' 8"").  "
but the earbuds are badly bass heavy.  
probably the most heavy in bass earbuds
i've ever experienced.  
everything i listen to is slightly drowned out and fuzzy sounding like the bass is turned all the way up.  
i'd return them
but i already discarded of the box (never expected the sound would be such a big issue).
the team contact me and gave all the information i need to know.
they also informed me about the one year warranty.
the headphones are amazing and the sound quality is great.
now the sound doesn't block of all the external sounds at low sound level which is good if you want to hear if someone is calling your name.
if you want total sound blockage just turn it up a little and you got it.
it's well worth
it's price.
1 year warranty from the manufacturer
so i'm happy
all the sudden one day the wooden casing just decided to say no more as i was pulling the earbud out of my eardrum
don't know what it is
but these have an incredible sound!!!  
well worth the extra expense for these.
construction is not cheap!!!  
"having said that, you will not be able to rest your head to the side as they do stick out a bit."
"to me, the sound quality and overall comfort of the ear buds off sets this minor issue."
"just bought these a week ago on oct 12, 2015.  "
so far so good.  
"sound isn't blow your mind amazing, but i was not expecting that.  "
they sound great  for the price.  
"also a note, they do not have volume control on the wire.  "
it is just a play and pause.  
i have not tried answering a call yet while listening to music so not sure if the button also answers calls.  
cable is slightly stiff but a great option because it can be looped up small and does not tangle.  
you also get 3 different sizes of ear inserts to choose from.  
overall great buy for the price.  
"i have had 3 cheap $5 headphones that have all broken and are not loud enough, so this to me was a smarter buy."
these headphones are great to look at but not much else.
"sound is average, but what really ruined the product was the cord."
"i have no idea what it's made from, but no matter what i do the cord is bunched up."
there's no straightening it out
and i can't put my phone in my pocket with out it disconnecting.
the sound from these earbuds is orgasmic.
"i've never heard such great, deep, clear bass from earbuds, and the mids and highs are great as well."
"i've cranked these up far louder than i should, and the sounds is still so clear --"
"dangerous, you must remind yourself that even though it's such a clean sound, your eardrums might not dig it."
"one downside, though, is they're not good for brisk walking or running --"
the cord rubbing against clothing sounds strange and the seal in my ears seems to come and go.
but $25 for mindblowing sound from little beautiful earbuds -- i'm in love.
i bought these earbuds for myself a couple of months ago.
"when my husband complained that his kept breaking, i bought these for him as a surprise."
"he loves them, too."
so far they're incredibly sturdy and the cords don't snarl.
i get good sound from the ancient mp3 player that i use when i work out.
"best of all, they work great with my iphone when i call in to meetings."
"no one says they can't hear me or complains about background noise, and i can hear everyone perfectly."
i highly recommend these earbuds.
worst headphones i've ever used.
they fall apart so easily.
where's the quality control?
i've had these headphones for a month and
i can honestly say that for the price you pay these are execlent earbuds.
"i have had better, far more expensive headphones but for only about $25 dollars these are definetly worth it."
they are not audiophile grade or anything
but they sound good and have decent nosie cancalation but nothing too over powering.
they also surprised me when i accidentally left them in my pants and i put them in the washing machine.
i was surprised to find they worked perfectly fine after words.
the one con to these is the cord has a lot of friction which can be annoying when pulling them apart and the cord can be nosiy but nothing too crazy.
if your in need of some quick and cheap but also great earbuds to take on the go
these are execlent for that
excellent reproduction of my operas even from a sony s-amplifier.
it seems that the varnished wood body makes the sound wonderful.
it gives great depth of bass and wonderful high notes just as from a many times more expensive head- set.
i consider the best set to take in my travels.
i highly recommend this product.
this is my second pair.
i love it because you don't hear the outside noise.
i only bought a new one because the other one broke but after almost a year.
no complaint at al.
much better than the beats by dre or any too expensive earphones.
"especially if you love accoustic music, this is the pair"
the quality in both manufacturing and performance is superb for such a reasonably priced pair of earbuds.
"to top it off, the product is aesthetically pleasing."
"there was a small defect in the first pair that i received, but the customer support from the symphonized team is second to none."
i easily and quickly received a new pair of perfect earbuds.
i have recommended this product to many family members and friends.
a few of them have obtained this product and are highly satisfied.
love this!
wow.
"listening to this, i feel like i am listening to high quality speakers."
the bass is probably the best i've ever seen in earphones.
only reason this doesn't get a full 5 stars is the highs are a bit too screechy.
seems the earphones adjust over a few dys (or maybe i just get used to it) but that's a small problem.
"also, would be nice if there was a volume button."
"update: although the replacement pair broke the same as the original pair, the customer service was amazing."
i definitely recommend this brand as a company.
"these headphones worked for a little while, and i did like them while they worked."
"i took great care of them, always put them away, and never roughed them up."
"after less than 1.5 months of use, you can't hear any music or use the microphone at all."
"thought it was maybe my phones jack that wasn't working, but i tried my cheaper set of headphones and they still work perfectly."
very disappointed and not worth the money.
*

update****after submitting my original disappointment.
i was immediately contacted by customer service who sent our a replacement pair that day!
how awesome is that!!!!
i change my one star to 5!!!

was really excited about these earphones..
the sound is amazing.
"the only problem is, they stopped working yesterday."
ive only had them a little over a month.
the one earbud shorted out.
really disappointed.
trying to figure out how to get in touch w the seller.
the sound is very grainy.
not very much noise cancellation.
fall out of the ear easily.
i wouldn't buy these again.
i've found cheaper headphones that had better sound quality.
these headphones sound amazing!!!
i was honestly surprised how good the bass is on these.
these headphones are just as good if not better sounding than my audio technica over ear headphones.
there is one kind of annoying thing about these headphones and that is the fit.
when you get these bad boys it comes with three different ear piece sizings.
i've tried all 3 different sizes and they all don't fit that great.
maybe i just have weird ears of the plastic pieces suck.
it's annoying because i use these headphones while i work out and they fall out a lot.
other than that they are great for going to the library and they reduce the sound around you.
i've been using these headphones for a month now
and i can tell they are above average quality.
they don't have much of a bass and the sound is not clear as in a  bose.
but they are probably worth the price you pay for them.
the only bad thing i can think of is that the wire produces some sound when  it hits something or rubs against your shirt which is not good.
"i recently had plastic earbuds, then switched to metal, and now wooden earbuds.  "
"i am not an audiophile but can say these wooden earbuds have a clearer, more bass sounds.  "
very impressed - am going to buy another pair for backup.  
good value for the money.
i wore these earbuds for about 3 months.  
"no abuse, only putting them in my ear and taking them out.  "
last week (after only 3 months of use) the wooden stem which the rubber part of the ear bud fits over broke.  
no way to fix or replace.  
they were terrific while they lasted but only 3 months.....
these are great looking and even better sounding than my all other earbuds.
i also own a set of active noise cancelling bose quiet comfort 15s which are pretty top notch as well as a set of serious studio monitors at my desk and these little earbuds give them both a run for the money.
my first set stopped working and the company offered to send me a new pair.  
they sound fantastic and are working excellent.  
they came with three different sized ear buds
"and i swapped out to the smaller ones, so"
they're comfortable too.  
"highly recommend these, great product and great company who stands behind their stuff."
a different ones thi
"these are great headphones, for the money they have great sound quality"
and i like the extra long cable.
the only problem i have with them is that they break too easily
i have gone through a couple of pairs already each lasting me only about 6 months
wonderful.
i can hear clearly and people can hear me when i talk to them.
exactly what i was looking for in earbuds.
i like the sound of the music in them as well.
"i am picky when it comes to speakers and sound, i can not say that i am a music critic, but these sound good in my opinion."
"solid bass, good sound, comfortable, great design, needs flexible cord."
"ordered these a second time, after having been shipped the wrong item on the first order."
they are worth every penny.
they sound way better than some more expensive/ similar priced headphones i've tried.
"for the price, hard to find better."
this is my go-to brand doe my teenagers.
update
: they always stop working in one ear.
had to switch brands.
i bought these based on the good reviews of others and liked the design.  
i was not disappointed.  
i received several compliments on the style
and they fit me perfectly.  
the in ear design was comfortable enough to wear all day.  
they keep out ambient nose and have great bass - which is important to me since i listen to dubstep and techno.
"great sound quality, came with a nice variety of silicone covers"
so  i was able to get a good in-ear fit.
the angled jack is an interesting touch; i'll update as i see how it holds up compared to more traditional setups.
the multiple layers of protection on the cord are a nice touch.
they were very uncomfortable.
anything past medium volume buzzed.
the right ear bud would go in and out of audio.
they look really cool but that’s about it.
pretty unsatisfied.

sound quality and is excellent.
"comfort is guaranteed since they provide different sizes of rubber ear buds (which you can remove and clean too).and best of all, the color & wood are so unique that nobody can claim them (which is a bonus for people living in a busy household)."
i just love these things pleasing to the eye and i appreciate that some took the time to carve out wood into these shapes
only problem after awhile they start to slip a little out of your ear
but they have alternating sizes
i just like the one size fits all kinda.
i had a set of skull candy ink'd buds that turned up missing(and none of the kids know what happened to them...
sure).
i was looking at getting another pair because they were decent quality and were cheap.
these popped up in my search and had good reviews... and were only a few dollars more
so i thought i would give them a try.
they were just delivered today
"so i plugged them into my phone and played broken, by seether with amy lee ( on the punisher soundtrack)"
followed by black water by the dooby brothers.
"the low tones are so rich and warm,i was totally shocked."
can't wait to plug them in tomorrow at work and let the broadcast my play list.
"so far i'm not disappointed!update,  day two.  "
"used them all day today,  they sound great.  "
"they fit right in my ear, block a lot of the noise around me,  even though they are not noise canceling.  "
the cord looks to be braided but it has a rubber feeling to it
maybe it's braided with a clear rubber coating?
it's hard to tell with these old eyes.
do you plug that goes into my phone
is awesome!
works well with my phone case and  
the cord is on thank you 135° angle instead of the 90 or straight out which can cause stress on the cord or connection to the phone.  
"i haven't used it on a phone call yet, but the button on the cord was very handy for closing and playing music."
i gave it 4 stars because it is not perfect.
for the price i don't expect perfect.
"the two biggest problems are the wind noise when you area,owing around and the thump thump you hear when the cord hits anything."
"but, the sound quality is very good and the mic works well."
"my only negative comment would be that the ear buds did not fit my ears, they keep falling out."
frustrating!!  
now to be fair
it may me
the shape of my ears.
"i tried each size that sent, however each size kept falling out when my head  moved."
"other than that inconvenience, the sound is spectacular."
i will definitely purchase symphonized products.
"these earbuds produce an amazing, rich sound.  "
i can hear instruments that i've never been able to pick out before in songs that i've listened to for decades!  
the bass is richer than other brands priced under $50 without being overpowering.
the only reasons that i did not rate them a 5 star are 1)
"i have only 3 other recent earbuds to rate these against (these win hands-down), and"
2) even the very best earbuds are a step-down from a regular sound system with good speakers.
i was thoroughly impressed by the quality and performance of these headphones.
i had read the good reviews
but i was still skeptical because of the price.
these headphones have performed better than those 3 times the price.
"when the headphones are on a low volume, i still can't hear all the noises of a busy house or even at work."
"i'd like to say these are mediocre, but if ever you've had beats (dre) earbuds, or sony earbuds previously.."
the bass & sound quality is nothing in comparison.
"for the price point, they are decent."
"but if you are looking for good bass and sound quality for music, these are a super back up."
"have had these for a couple months, and they have been really great."
best pair of earbuds
"i've owned, even somewhat comparable to my audio technica ath-m50x."
honestly though this isn't a review.
i'm just writing this mainly in grief of these recently departed pair of earbuds.
i'm currently on a trip to kentucky and somehow managed to get them caught in the car door.
"if it means anything to you about the quality of these earbuds, i'm going to immediately purchase another pair as soon as i arrive home."
"rip earbuds june 18, 2017"
these super light and comfortable buds( because of the adjustable ear cushions) sound just as good as earbuds four times the price.
super strong cord that can easily take a big fall from any device.
this is my second pair.
i bought these for a month long trip.
as the trip came up almost right after these came i
i did not return it.
if i had the time i would definitely have.
not sure if o let my product was defective but when the wire moves (the cord swaying when you walk)
i can hear very loud creaking due to the movements.
if you plan to not move as you use these then it's a decent purchase.
"if you plan to move around a bit, horrible."
work out?
forget about it.
"i just received mine, put them in my ears whilst playing springsteen, and immediately went back on amazon to buy another pair."
"the silver design is classy, the bass is beautiful, and the noice cancellation is great."
"warning, it's really loud compared to other earbuds, i kinda blew out my eardrums when i first plugged them in."
i bought these for my daughter.
usually the ear buds we buy burn out in six months or less.
these are still going strong after two years of use.
wow!  
i was really impressed with sound out of the little guys.
for the price you can't beat the sound and they are super cool looking and comfortable...
i am planning to buy additional pairs and some for my kids...
toss the iphone earbuds and buy these.. now!!
"impressed by sound however like some reviews said, you hear the cables bump when walking."
they are rough.
i'm using these when working at home.
you can't hear anything from outside.
use these for low movement activities.
"working, studying, on a plane, etc."
not for walking or working out.
love these headphones.  
"great sound, comfortable and great value."
i was very excited to get my symphonized nrgs today and couldn't wait to try them out for the first time.
i plugged the earphones into my phone and they worked great
", the sound quality was there plus they had a good in ear feel to them."
now keep in mind
i was being very careful with my new nrgs
so i was quite shocked when i unplugged them from my phone
", the jack stayed in while the rubber bit just slipped right off."
im very upset with the how long i waited for these earphones only to be shut down by the build quality.
i do like the nrgs
", i just wish i got to enjoy them more than 10 minutes"
you get what you pay for...
i've bought these twice (since i lost a pair) and they're just damn good headphones for a damn good price.
they don't randomly trigger siri
"if i bump into the headphone jack while i'm walking, which is a huge plus."
i listen to bass heavy rap and these are perfect!
i really enjoy my symphonized headphones.
i had my first pair for well over a year before i accidentally broke them.
i have a $200+ headset for home use and symphonized nrg headphones have become my go to choice for on the go listening.
really great sound at a really great price.
i feel like i've gotten an overwhelming deal and keep waiting for them to raise the price even more haha!
they are probably the best earbuds i've ever owned.
the sound quality is unmatched.
i would say that they're worth the price except for the fact that the right earbud died after 2 months of use.
"this might not be a consistent problem, but it has left me extremely disappointed."

"this might not be a consistent problem, but it has left me extremely disappointed."
i've had a lot of in-ear headphones over the last 10-15 years.
"my reference for a long time has been the sennheiser cx495, a great combination of balanced sound reproduction, reasonable sound isolation, and good price point."
these symphonized nrg 2.0 ones are quite nice.
"i got them primarily because i needed a good option for making phone calls, and so a mic was an essential consideration."
"sound isolation is great, and i think the wood body adds a nice degree of warmth to the sound."
"i'm giving these 4 stars because of two elements, one a matter of taste, and the second a matter of poor design."
"first, they're a bit too bassy for my taste."
"i like flat response, so this will not be a deterrent for many."
mids and highs are very good.
"however and second, the cord design sucks."
"the braided design and clear jacket are aesthetically nice, but the thick cable and rigid connection at the earpiece means a ridiculous amount of cord noise works it's way into the mix anytime you are in motion."
"i managed to minimize this by adding a clip just below the 'y' split, and then clipping that to my shirt or jacket."
i'm pretty particular about the sound that i get from earbuds/headphones.
"i need the bottom end of music, i do not like the ""am"" sound from cheap,  bad headphones."
"i really like the sound that i get from these earbuds, and you cant be at the price for really good quality sound."
i would highly recommend these earbuds!
"the headphones feel very nice, and look beautiful."
"they're comfortable for hours on end, and the sound is absolutely marvelous for the price."
"i was a little wary of the quality of these because of the price, but they seem to be amazing so far."
the bass is one thing i'd like to comment on..
it's above my expectations.
i'd say it's the equivalent sound to $200 headphones out there.
"overall, i would definitely recommend these."
this is not the first pair i have purchased.  
"i would agree that the sound quality is great, however, if these do not last but a few months, why bother with them??  "
"either the manufacturer needs to reinforce these to a sensible quality, or i can't see purchasing these again in the future."
"after reading my review, the vendor reached out immediately and offered to replace the defective set."
much appreciated - very impressive customer service.
great sounding buds.
i solved the poor construction with some gorilla glue and never looked back.
however the play/stop mechanism randomly stops audio or t without touching cable - strange and annoying - it will do the a dozen times an hour at gym.....
i own at least 6 pair of these headphones.
i would give them a 5 if i could go only in sound.
i have owned up to 12 or more pairs in the past.
i can't quit buying them because the sound quality beats 12 other brands including bose and skull candy.
i walk 3 to 5 miles a day in preparation for future mission trips and i can't stop buying them.
i am also a technical director at a satellite campus for one of the largest and most fabulous churches in the u.s.
and i need these headphones desperstely because i cannot here
the feed from our main campus over our local worship band rehearsing.
on sundays i use these headpones from 5am to 1pm.
i don't know what i am going to do.
i am ordering another pair as i give them 1 star.
as i use them at home watching movies that i have seen a at least 100 times and the clarity of the headphones is so clear i hear
sounds in the background and understand things characters are saying that i missed watching the other 100 times.
my favorite part is that they are by far the best for quality sound  
"and they can be loud, which i love."
i have been searching for over 3 years or more
and i have found no headphones from the cheapest to the $300 ones that will go as loud as these and the sound quality stays excellent.
a lot of earbud lose quality of sound when you turn then up.
not these.
"we have one working pair left and my 14 year old son and i his mom, are always fighting over who gets to use them and we have 30 more pair in the house"
and we both want the symphonized  ear buds.
we have a several different styles.
i am going to include a picture of the six pairs i still have.
the only problem is within 6 months 1 earbud stops working or a piece breaks off.
recently they have held together well but one ear bud stops working.
i am devastated.
i will give this pair a try but don't know what to do if it these do the same bc i can't afford to keep buying them even at the reasonable price.
"i am not including all of the earbuds in the picture because those were given to my grown children who loved them, as well until one earbud went out."
such a shame for such amazing sound.
they by far have the best sound quality
i have
ever heard
and i dont care about price.
they broke right where the wire goes into the earbud.
too bad because i thought the sound was good.
they didn't last me a year.

great ear buds.
i'd give the noise cancelation a 7.5 out of 10.
the bass is great and the sound is clear and you can raise the volume without that annoying vibrating feedback sound.
they are very durable and comfortable.
the sound isn't as crisp as most earbuds.
"it's more of a rich, warm sound, like it's coming from a wooden instrument, it's more resonant, different but very nice and not so different that it sounds odd."
i have had these for about 2.5 months.  
while they worked they were great but in the past couple of weeks they have started to cut in and out.  
i believe this is due to the plug that connects to my ipod.  
if i bend it slightly it will cut back in/out.  
while they lasted they were great.  
i enjoyed the thicker cords that makes untangling them easy
but if it will only last a couple of months before i need another pair...
then i need something better.  
also for me the cords can come off a little pink...
so guys maybe you may want another color if you decide to roll the dice on these earbuds.
great sound.
i purchased the ear buds with the microphone.
the only thing i do not like about them is that there are no controls on the microphone area.
"you must use the phone itself to answer, control volume, etc."
"otherwise they are very comfortable, which is the most important thing for me."
these earbuds are better than any others i have purchased - and they cost a lot less than most of them.
"music sounds good across the spectrum with clean, crisp treble and excellent bass."
they also look great.
it's a bit surprising that they still cost so little.
definitely would recommend them!
"while they sound great and look cool, there is a rather significant design flaw.  "
"unless i sit perfectly still, i can hear every jostle of the cord competing with the music, to the point"
it's extremely distracting...
almost deafening.  
"on reading reviews for the 3.0 version, sounds like this problem might be resolved in the next generation.  "
wish i'd paid the extra few dollars for those instead.
i've only used these headphones a couple of times but bought them so i could reduce the sound of people around me
"so i could study, and they work amazingly!"
"i think it's because wood is a poor conductor, so compaired to plastic ear buds"
these are so much better!
the rubber part that goes inside your ear crests a nice seal and they even give you multiple sized to switch out
so they can fit anyone!
i highly recommend!!
the sound quality isn't poor but not the best either.
i used skullcandy earbuds for years and wanted something that looked at bit more grown up.
sound quality isn't as rich and the bass notes aren't as deep.
"the sound doesn't seem to deteriorate at higher volumes, which is good."
we were looking for noise reducing earbuds at one of those big box stores.
all of their product offerings were priced well over $100.
i suggested that we try these at around $25.
we were not disappointed!
symphonized works really well at a fraction of the cost.
"these are very good quality and have an awesome sound, and they reduce noise like a charm."
we are loyal customers for life now!
"one for my computer/iphone use at home, one for the office, and one for my husband."
they're sturdy and have really good sound.
and the microphone works better than a dedicated desktop microphone when i record narration for the videos i create in camtasia.
ditched skull candies nearly 6 years ago.
i buy a new pair of earbuds every 2 years and haven't looked back.
the 1 year warranty is also amazing and they have fast service.
"i was doubting how noise canceling these can be, i work in a loud factory and when i started playing my music alls"
i had to say was
wow
i didnt hear nothing but my music and really good sound as well.
will buy again
super solid sound.
"really well rounded, which at the price point is hard to find."
nice length to the cable as well.
i had another pair which are still going.
the only part that didn't hold up was the plastic protective part which covered the connection point between the caple and the wooden earbud.
"but that's pretty minor, especially after owning it for over a hear w/ heavy daily use."
"best headphone, for the pice, good sound, bought 3."
it was great for a while.
the sound was 10/10 and the earbuds fit perfectly in my ears.
however the construction of the earbuds is imperfect.
after 1 month they broke.
"upgrade to 5 stars, costumer service is amazing."
sent me out a new pair of headphones in a timely fashion.
so far no problems.
highly recommended.
for the price i think these are a good deal.
i really like the dark wood with turquoise cable combination.
"also, these fit comfortably in my ear and allow for answering the phone or switching tracks by using the button on the cable."
the only reason i don't give them 5 stars is because the sound is a bit thin at times; i have to turn up the volume in order to hear the low-end response.
"overall i would say that the sound quality is good, not great."
still a good deal though at $25.99.
after a year and two trips through my washing machine
these things are still working like the day they came.
"the sound quality is great, the cable is long for you tall folks who struggle with the buds reaching your ears from your pocket and while they're not noise cancelling they actually cut out a lot of background noise"
(coworkers will scare you in your cubicle cause you have no idea they're there).
"good price, good quality, 5 stars."
i lovvvve these.
good quality and style for the price
":) there is a button on the cord that can be used to pause songs, which is super convenient."
"tangles not nearly as easily as version 1, so props to the company for the improvements made to the 2.0."
they make me one happy college student on my walks to class lemme tell ya
sounds as good as f not better than bose headphones.
"after trying different size of silicone buds ( included), i finally settle for the biggest one -"
i guess i have big ears.
the noise cancellation is awesome and the sound is crystalline clear.
amazing sound.
for the money i'd say as good as the $100.00 plus earbuds that i own (some eight or ten pair).
"comfortable, light and great sound response with a flat setting on eq."
you'll love em' really do love mine.
"the wire is also fairly tangle free, what a plus right?"
"these headphone sound great actually, pleasantly surprised."
the bass is nice and crisp and the headphones themselves are very comfortable.
two things i think could be fixed.
"one, the plug itself seems to come out easily, it doesn't sit in the headphone plug very well."
does not take much for it to come out.
"one other thing is the mic mute/unmute button could be loosened a little, feels very stiff and you need to push somewhat hard for it to finally click."
other than those two things these headphones are really awesome.
"i purchased these headphones with the intent of using them with my smartphone, meaning i was looking for a pair of headphones that included a mic."
these headphones do not have a mic.
"there is, however, a fancy plastic piece on the cable that wants to be a placeholder for a mic."
"perhaps another model of the symphonized headphones include a mic, sadly these do not."
i have already started my return and will be searching for a new pair of headphones from a different manufacturer.
as far as the sound quality goes - i can't comment as i was not afforded the experience of enjoying my purchase.
womp womp.
thanks symphonized.
i've purchased these twice.
had the same issues with both sets.
about 2 months in the earbud separated in the front.
as if it was not glued on.
this happened with one bud in the first one and both in the second set purchased.
other than that they were comfortable and sounded good.
just a waste of $$$$.

"i absolutely hate regular headphone chords, you know, the ones that are all plastic and tangle like no other."
these headphones are advertised with a braided chord...
"but if it's coated in plastic, then it really is no different!"
it's kind of got this sticky feel too
which doesn't help when trying to untangle it.
horrible.
"if the chord is an important factor for you, avoid this."
"as for sound quality, they're pretty decent."
awesome sound with these earbuds.
even after finding them in the pocket of my jeans when i took them out of the dryer.
and both the cat and dog have yet to bite through them.
they still sound amazing after their bath and sauna.
they must be bionic.
i lost my old pair of headphones a while back
and i found these a little while back.
i've only owned them for a few days now
but i can say they've done really well so far.
they look refined with the wood finish and are rather unobtrusive (depending on the color scheme you get).
"further, they give a great range of audio quality and the sound clarity is really nice."
"at a price of $25, i'm extremely satisfied with this purchase."
"earbuds sounded good, honestly they were a little too bass-y for my taste, but they blocked noise pretty decently."
what i'm disappointed with is that these lasted me just under 5 months before the left one died.
i normally expect at least a year out of earbuds at this price point.
really great sound quality for in ear.  
"and, the wood grain and gold braided cord is of much better quality than i expected.  "
"solid build, no complaints..."
very pleased!
update: awesome customer service.  
they're sending a new pair.  
"i hope these hold up, since i've really enjoyed these earbuds' look, sound, and feel."
old: i really enjoyed these earbuds.  
"i managed to get almost 8 months of occasional use out of them, but i was hoping for longer since my $10 earbuds lasted about that long.  "
"sadly, after 8 months, there is a short in the cable causing intermittent interference, and the earbud itself is pulling apart.  "
occasional use is about 1 hour a day either walking or use at the gym.
these are the best headphones that i've used period.
in my opinion there better than skullcandy headphones and have similar quality to bose headphones.
the little pouch is great and helps with keeping the headphones from tangling.
the headphones also have some good bass and is good at cancelling the surrounding noise.
i'm actually going to buy a second pair because i like them alot.
i have purchased several pairs of symphonized earbuds/headphones over the past few years because the sound quality and comfort is excellent.
"however, the same problem occurred with each set: one ear eventually lost its functionality after several months of use."
my favorite headphones !
the sound is extremely worth the price and they're much better then apple headphones.
great quality.
i'm not a big fan of how bulky/long the plug is -
it makes it really easy to get accidentally knocked/bent when plugged in.
"this happened to my pair, so the sound started coming out only from one earpiece."
"luckily symphonized's customer service is very understanding, and they sent me a new pair, no questions asked."
i'll just have to be more careful!
"otherwise the wood detail is lovely, and the coating around the cables protects the fabric from fraying or getting messed up."
these are great headphones.
even when we had trouble with a previous pair they were replaced under warranty.
they keep outside noise out so you can really enjoy your music.
day 1 of having purchased a replacement pair of these and my happiness is renewed.  
the light color of wood is exactly as i wanted and the gold wire is not as shiny as the picture suggests.  
this leaves me with a product that i would call perfect.  
"the sound is beautiful and crisp,"
"i bought these for christmas 2015, so i've been using them really since january 2016.first off, they sound amazing."
probably the best sounding earbuds
i've ever owned.
i was really impressed.
"however, i've been using them for the last few months for my commute to work and and to listen to music while at work."
"today, the right earbud went out and will not come back."
i'm just past the one year warranty period.
i feel that i've taken really good care of them and to have them just suddenly die is rather discouraging.
bought it for my husband.  
he just loves and calls it the best gift ever!  
the sound is crisp and clear.  
"they fit great in the ear, very comfortable unlike a pair of panasonics that i bought last year.  "
"the rubber buds are soft enough to conform in your ear canal and practically no outside noise can be heard, yet durable enough to not fall out of your ear.  "
for the price these are fantastic!  
don't miss out!  
"the wood may be a factor in the great sound, but to me it makes it look great, rich and unique!  "
great deal!
i like them.  
nice fit.  
decent noise suppression.  
"i'm not in any way an audiophile, but they've got great sound with just enough bass and nice clarity.  "
i've had wooden
"ear buds before and liked the sound, which is why i tried these.  "
no complaints thus far.
"i love the look and feel of these earbuds, but unfortunately, both of the pairs i purchased no longer work.  "
"in one case the microphone doesn't work, and in the other the earbuds are falling apart.  "
"so i have to say, definitely not worth it."
"awesome earphones!they don't tangle, and have lasted forever!"
will totally buy them again.
ps - they actually stay in your ear when running.
total plus.
these headphones have great sound and are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.
the headphones are visually appealing.  
i found the earbuds to be  uncomfortable and they kept falling out of my ears.
the company was quick to follow up on my previous review and helped to correct the issues that i was having before.
liked the design & the honey  
wooden look .the
"performance was ok for a couple of days ,then turned into noises and static whenever volume was increased ..."
"only one ear is working now,just after 2 weeks of purchase."
hear static noise when it runs against clothing.
overall not satisfied.
i've only had these for a couple of weeks
but i am really happy i bought them.
they sound great; i wasn't sure if i would like these because the last headphones i owned were the beats solo and really enjoyed the bass heavy sound of those
but with the nrg 2.0 am can say that i'm not missing my beats at all.
the packaging and look was also a big plus for me.
i am usually the type of person to never use the carrying case with headphones
but i like the detail and material of this case
so much i actually use it.
i hope that in the long run they do not fall apart.
i am not impressed with these headphones.
one earbud is muffled and there is a shortage in the cord.
i have only had these for the last two weeks.
"also they slip out of my ears, despite going down in earbud size."
would not purchase again.
hoping the company will respond to my call in regards to the issue.
in the past i have spent a lot of money on ear buds.
mostly i have purchased shure.
"sadly i have had to send most of those back and forth because they break, didn't work etc."
"i still have one pair that was sent back, replaced and still has the same issue."
so far with thesesymphonized nrg 2.0 (1 day in)
i'm very happy.
the sound is just as good as my $100+ shures that still don't work lol.
for the price these are awesome.
if they break i can just buy a new pair at the fraction of the price i would pay for shure's or other top brands.
for the price these are great ear buds!
i have used several others at the same price range but non of them come close to comparing to symphonized.
i bought these to use while working around noisy equipment which they do a wonderful job at but also
found i like using them at home quite a bit.
"great base, hi's could be a bit stronger but are still good."
i like them
so well i'm going to order a few more for back ups.
had to super glue wood back together on both sides.
great earbuds the tuning could be changed a little
the bass is a bit to overpowered which i prefer when i waork the comfort is just not there
they fell like your aticking a toilet plunger over your ears
the soundstage is not like what it says you can barely notice it
but for the price
its worth to pick up if u want throw aways.
they do a great job at noise cancelling.
but the cable could be more flexible and the earphone jack is a little bit cumbersome.
"although i had some issues with the earphones that unglued into two separate pieces (see picture), this happened after 6 months of everyday use and i promptly received a free replacement as the product comes with 12-month guarantee!"
great fit decent sound.  
i was looking for replacements for my shures.  
price is good for being a decent pair.  
they are lacking in the highs.  
lows are almost too much.
i cant hear voice very well watching moives on ipad.
i plugged them into my computer and listened to a little amazon prime music.
the sound was incredibly good; as good as far more expensive over the ear phones i've used.
"light, easy to carry and perfect for those long airline trips."
loved them so much my friend stole them
"great sound, only complaint is the wire gets a little curly and can be annoying."
good sound quality and very comfortable fit.
my dog went after the wood in these and chewed them up.
but i liked the product enough to order another pair.
good earphones.
"good headphones for the price, especially if you love bass."
not too durable though.
"after about 6 months of use, they started to fall apart."
left earbud split in half at the metal band and stopped working.
the wiring inside appears to be connected.
the sound quality and noise cancellation are good but i wish these lasted longer.
i bought them for durability the sound quality is a bonus.  
nice looking as well.
it's just an average earphone with increased bass.
"but due to it, high frequency is lacking."
only part
i was dissatisfied
is a rubber coating on the wires.
i was expecting nylon/cloth wrapped wires
but it's just a rubber finish.
i wanted to test them before i left a review.
i'm so happy with this purchase.
i leave these on all day
and i wear glasses.
they are so comfortable on my ears with my glasses too.
great sound and love the noise cancellation.
bought a pair for two relatives and they love their gift.
i bought an extra pair to switch when the other one needs charging.
i can watch tv or listen to music
and i don't have to disturb others.
if anyone has roku and the roku app on their phone with the headphones button on the roku app.
"just pair your headphones with bluetooth on your phone, open the roku app on your phone, tap on remote, tap on headphone icon and enjoy late night movies without disturbing others."
i don't even plug headphones into the roku remote anymore.  
you can watch any app you have downloaded on your roku and listen wireless with these headphones.  
the movie/show pauses when a call comes through.
if it's a short call it resumes and if it's a long call you may have to use the roku remote to resume play.
i workout with these headphones too.
so glad i don't have to keep pushing them in my ear or worry about them falling out.
i did not expect this from the price i paid for these headphones.
i may update this later in six months.
my dr wired headphones last for years.
this is my first pair of wireless bluetooth headphones.
hopefully these will last too.
"the idea that a bluetooth headphone offered really great sound and noise cancelling capabilities for just $20 usd was simply ridiculous a couple of years ago, i’m completely satisfied with this product, so far everything is great."
they are really comfortable; the design is so that sometimes you forget you are even wearing them.
it comes with 3 earbud sizes and finding the right fit is perhaps the most important task you need to accomplish if you wish to get your headphones full potential.  
an inappropriate fit will lessen the sound and noise cancelling features
but of course this in only logical.
"i’ve used them running, riding a bike and also while at office work.  "
"another great thing i didn’t except at all was the microphone quality, i don't like speaking loud when on a call, so far everyone listens to me just fine."
voice activating commands availability is great and also the possibility to pair a second device is nice.
so overall i’m pretty happy with this product
", i’m even giving them as presents to close friends this christmas."
update:
"so after posting the review below, i was contacted by their customer support."
they suggested that the pair i received may have had a manufacturing flaw and sent me a new pair free of charge after i had returned the original pair.
"i really didn't think it would change anything, but to my great surprise, they actually did fit into my ears and make a seal."
i did have to tilt them way up and work them in before moving the straps over my ears
so it takes a bit of maneuvering for me.
"giving them another test run, i found with the proper fit, the sound quality greatly improved."
"for my ears though, they still slip partially out when moving around and have to be adjusted frequently during workouts."
"the back of my ears get a bit sore after about 90 mins of use, due to the tension of the ear strap."
i still found the cord to look much more flimsy than in the picture.
"however, for the price, these things work pretty well."
"casually sitting at my desk, i don't have to adjust them quite as frequently, and the battery life is decent."
"in addition, i greatly appreciate the customer support.  "
for all those reasons i did increase my rating.  
"i'd say the new pair is about 3 stars, but the customer support raises it another 1 star for me."
original review
":i purchased several similar wireless headphones (details below) trying to find a pair that would stay in my ear, especially while running.  "
these have a weird design that doesn't allow the earbud to fit inside the ear to make a good seal.  
i tried all three sizes but the flat rounded part right before the tip prevents the earbud from getting into the ear and making a good seal.  
the sound quality is pretty poor without a good seal.  
"also, it's pretty infuriating that the cord does not look like the picture.  "
"instead of it being a nice looking straight band like shown, its all crumpled and wavy and looks terrible and cheap."
"out of the all the ones i tried (4 from amazon and the 2 from walmart): treblab j1 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b06zxr7646/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01__o00_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1fyi, other ones i tried on amazon:> villain wireless headphones - exact same issue.  "
"bad design, the flat round part that keeps the buds out of your ear canal."
>
phaiser
bhs-530 -
these are a little better.  
the make it part of the way in but still can't make a good seal because of
the design causes them to pivot and pop out of your ear as soon as you move.
"i initially wondered how good these wireless headphones can be considering the price point, but after using them for several weeks, i was amazed by the quality results these headphones deliver and how well they matched the description from the product page."
sound/audio:-
"after using it for several weeks and comparing it with some other wireless headphones, i think the audio and sound is one of the highest quality for bluetooth, wireless earbuds-"
"the bass is really good, and the stereo sound is amazing-"
"i really like the cvc noice cancelling feature,"
"when i'm in a noisy environment such as the train, these headphones do a really good job of blocking out the outside noise and allowing you to focus on the sound from the headphones- you can listen to these headphones from a good amount of distance from your devicedesign:-"
"the headphones fit very well in my ear and stay on very nicely even while i do activities such as working out at the gym, running, biking, etc.-"
they are very comfortable to wear-
i like how you can put them over your neck
so they don't come in the way-
"one feature that i would really love to see in the next version of this product are magnetic clips on the headphones so when they are over your shoulder, they can stick to each other making it easier to stay on your shouldersfunctionality-"
i love how quick and seamlessly the headphones connect to your device.
"since both pair of earbuds are wired to each other, there is no need for them to pair to each other; therefore, as soon as you turn them on, they pair automatically to your device very quick and easily-"
i like how you can control the volume of the sound from the top of the right earbud which is very convenient-
the battery life is amazing on these headphones.
i have been able to use these for the whole day without having to recharge them.
"sometimes when i don't use them heavily, they last several days without charge."
they battery
life for these is about 8 hours as listed on the product page which met my expectations for how long they will last with a single charge.
the charging time was also fairly quick for me to recharge the headphones.-
the earbuds worked really well with my iphone xs and also worked well with my mac and my windows 10

install flash player i bought these to wear when i go for walks and runs.
i wanted a inexpensive bluetooth ear bud that could get sweaty.
this is working great!!
i usually listen to an interval training app or a podcast.
the sound is great for that.
the noise canceling really works well.
so these would be even better for exercise in the gym.
"i have been leaving one bud out of my ear when outside, so i can still hear people approaching me on the trails."
i was using these while doing house work yesterday and i was able to answer my phone
and it paused my podcast.
"been using these headphones 4days now connected to my samsung phone with no problem and reconnected with my phone as soon i turn it on as long as my phone bluetooth is on ,made"
"well no problems so far ,sound quality is good"
"have used them while i'm working out,working in the yard and while i'm talking on the phone"
the person on the other end says it sounds clear and all controls work fine
", can't beat the price, will update the review if any problems but loving them right now holds charge been using the most of the days for long periods no problems"
i figured i would give a lengthy/in-depth review about these headphones.
"first, let me explain that i am a fairly active person"
and i am also a medical student on top of that
(this will be relevant later).
"i am going to break this down into five sections: connectivity, sound, running"
"/exercising, battery life, and controls."
connectivity:
i have an iphone and the headphones paired instantly.
"at first, i thought it was strange that they pair separately, but now i like it."
"if i want to put the left ear piece in and listen to lecture while jamming out, i can do so or vice versa."
sound:
"i have owned over the ear headphones, beats by dre, standard iphone ear pods, knock offs, etc."
"in my honest opinion, these compete with the best of them."
"they send you three different size earpieces (s,m, and l), and i found the medium is the best fit for myself and gives me the best bass/sound."
running
/exercising: i do insanity workouts (t25) and i also run.
"so, everything is high impact and quick paced."
"saying that, this is where my excitement for these headphones come in!"
"i purchased two different sets of headphones (these headphones) and a pair that are bluetooth, but they sort of hook over your ears."
"i tried them both out, and i eventually picked these over the “hooking” headphones."
"if you pick the correct earpiece (s,m, or l)"
they never fall out.
"battery life: it does have a fairly short battery life (around three hours), but if you carry the battery pack around with you, it can quadruple your battery for the headphones."
i pop these in during class lectures and listen to other material.
during lunch i will charge them and it carries me throughout the rest of the day.
"also, be sure to power them off when not in use."
controls:
"i’m used to basic headphones that do nothing, except allow you to listen to music."
"so, the fact that i can skip songs, and access siri with a touch of a button is nice."
"overall, i know this sounds like an infomercial, but i really enjoy the ease of these headphones."
"after seeing the wireless airpods, i knew it was only time until i wanted a pair."
"so, i researched what would best fit me and these took the"
cake.*if
"you found my review helpful, please let amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!"

install flash player i liked these ear buds so much that i have actually purchase a few pairs for family now.  
they seem sturdy;  they stay put in my ears even when i am pretty active.  
"more important to me, the sound quality is really great"
and i am hearing elements in music that i often don't hear or only normally hear with my $200 corded audiophile headset.  
that they can be purchased for under $100
makes them a great value.  
that they are closer to $25
makes them incredible!!

", i’m even giving them as presents to close friends this christmas."
"bluetooth is great, but when a call, earbuds are better since there is no interruptions of sound.  "
ear buds are comfortable and stay in well.  
sound is good and the slide volume is a good feature since turning the volume up or down
you do not need to touch your phone to do so.
first 48 hours great buy so far!
"sounds good for the price, and comes with a carrying case."
would definitely purchase again.
works perfect.
"no problems, arrived quickly."
my son loves them and i do to
these headphones are excellent they're super loud has excellent bass
also people can hear me clearly when i use the microphone.
they are exactly as described.
"i got these to replace my old oneplus silver bullets, which had decent bass already, and my first impression is that these are just as good or better."
the bass is strong and rich (for in ear headphones) and the volume is high.
these definitely sound better than what they are priced at.
"it's a sure purchase, great value."
i received the headphones very quickly and they sound great!
"the only negative i would say, is that the metallic ear parts came with scratches on them which is not a big deal"
but that might tell me that they are easily scratched.
surprisingly good sound and bass!
lots of goodies come in the package as well.
nice!
good headphones.  
well constructed and can resist the pulling/tugging
i do when i wear them at work.  
so far so good.  
great sound too!
these are amazing!
"i am so, so impressed!"
"the sounds quality is fabulous, and bass comes through beautifully."
"for the price, these are the best headphones i've ever bought."
they come with plenty of sizes for the ear buds and a small flat carry bag which keeps them from tangling.
highly recommend these!
the earbuds are great shipping was fast.
"the cord is very strong, durable and long and comes with multiple replacement earbud covers."
i work in a cubicle and the noise level can be distracting.
these buds cancel out the multiple conversations happeining around me.
love them.
these earbuds are excellent.
i love the quality.
i am very happy i chose these over other brands 🥰
i bought these for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them.
"they are absolutely amazing, and are especially great with bass sounds."
a great experience.
my boyfriend recommends trying them 43 seconds through aero chords shooting stars.
he’s in love.
the only problem—and a very small one at that—every once in a while the left ear dims.
i highly recommend them!
the sound quality is great.
best ear fit ever.
excellent for runners.
so far i am satisfied with these earphones and really impressed with all that came with it and the packaging it arrived in.
"included was a small storage bag and various earphone covers and everything was protected, even the pin plug had a plastic cover."
the bass response is very good and the noise canceling must work as the wife says i don’t hear when she’s talking(blaming
it on the earphones anyway).
overall the earphones appear to be a quality product.
the best for the price
"so far, so good.  "
beautifully packed earphones and the sound quality is pretty darn good.  
these are comfy and the cord seems strong and durable.  
i have a teenaged son who is super hard on his earbuds.  
i think these may go the distance.  
thank you.
great sound!
best $8 spent bar none!
"heavy bass, clear sound, solid construction."
let’s hope this lasts.
"wires are strong, buds fit well"
these.are.awesome.
i am hearing instruments that i did not hear with my other name-brand ear buds.
overall design is good.
i like the cable (fewer tangle problems than some others).
sound quality is adequate for the price.
bass is exaggerated but i suspect buyers of this would appreciate that.
"the ""open-back"" design helps but keep in mind others will likely hear what you're listening to."
fit can be a challenge unless you're one of those lucky people who's ears can accommodate largish buds.
people with small ear canals will probably not have a good experience.
they come with a surprising assortment of tips but none will make up for having smaller ears.
"saw a couple other views talking about shocks, glad i'm not crazy."
my headphones started sending tiny shocks to my ear a few months after use.
"they come out of nowhere and literally slightly sting my ear, definitely caused by the headphones, not sure what's wrong"
but it's physically painful
and i have to pull them out everytime
it happens.
"sounded great until the wire insulation separated from the ear buds, which led to the wire breaking.  "
the wires also turned green and tarnished once exposed to air.  
contacted the company and they did not respond.  
normal and careful use
and they are junk in 6 months.
i bought a pair of these sephia sp3060 earbuds a few years back and enjoyed listening to music with heavy bass or games with artillery fire.
"i thought it was no big deal, just quality earbuds.  "
then i went to a spacex falcon heavy rocket launch and recorded the audio with my galaxy s8.  
"i assumed it would be garbage audio,"
but when i loaded the file onto my gaming laptop and played it through these earbuds i was astounded at the quality and richness of the deep bass.  
"when i showed the video to my friend who was at the launch with me, he exclaimed, ""it sounds just like the real thing!""now of course these earbuds don't vibrate and compress your chest like real sonic booms, falcon heavy rocket launches, or m1a1 abrams main cannon fire, but they do the best they can to recreate the experience of deep bass environments.  "
for a little over ten dollars?
ridiculous.
now i've never owned $200 plus earbuds
"so maybe i haven't experienced greatness yet, but these beat my other $70 earbuds."
i'm planning on picking up a few pairs for all my devices.
great for gaming as well.
"good morning, afternoon, and evening."
"i want to start with the awesome packaging, very impressive."
comes with everything described.
i easily switched out the ear buds for the red memory foam ones that it also comes with.
comfortable in the ear.
you can hear people clearly when on the phone
but there was no noise cancelling.
"not sure why but when on the phone, even if i put the phone in my pocket or just held it behind my back, the person on the other end said i immediately sounded far away or was in a tunnel."
when in reality it should not matter because it should not be using my iphone speaker.
i got these
so i could listen to my workout music and make calls with them.
it doesn't seem like i am going to be making many calls unless the phone is directly in front of me.
"otherwise, if your listening to an audio book or music, you will like them."
i have gone through maybe ten different earphones trying to find a pair that both felt good in my ear and sounded good.
"the last pair i had paid $8.50 for they were panasonic ergofit, and they work pretty good."
"however, during the previous two weeks the sound started going out in them."
i also had some come with my iphone.
i was not too fond of the way they fit in my ear.
the sound was good.
"however, these sephia sp3060 earphones blow all of them out of the water."
i usually had to listen to my alexa on volume level 3 when in bed.
"i put these on level 1, and they sound like level v with any other earbud."
"not only that, the cable is extremely durable."
i would say this is the best $11 i ever spent.
and i have bought much stuff in the $10-$11 range.
i honestly would pay $50 on these.
they are that good!
i'm going to buy one more pair now put away in case the price does go up.
this is definitely in the top three items i have recommended someone else to purchase!
"worked pretty well, but the actual bud seemed heavier than the cord, so on both sides the plastic bit quickly eroded away leaving exposed wires on both sides, after that the buds stopped working  >:("
i have bought many brands of earbuds and non compare to sound and quality of these.  
the wires are near twice as heavy as other brands.  
the sound quality is crisp and the options of earbuds surpasses all other.  
i love the foam buds that comes with these as they are way way comfortable in the ears making a solid seal.  
i can see the price of these going way up as they become more popular.  
i think these are made in the uk which in my book makes them already better than skullcandy or other brands on the market made in china!!!  
chinese garbage has been making me mad a long time.  
also comes with a great leather case and the packaging is superb.  
cant say near enough good about these.  
i will be ordering several extra pairs before the price goes up.
"wow what can i say,"
oh wait
yeah
i know
....
i put these earbuds to the test with some old school metallica
and i was blown away with the sound quality
", you could hear each instrument playing with such clarity, the vocals stood out and when the double base drum kicked in it was like having a recording studio in my head."
i had the volume up all the way
and there was absolutely zero distortion and that says a lot for these ear buds when we are talking about metallica’s
ride the lightening album.
"these ear buds are awesome and very affordable, i would recommend these to anyone."
thank you sephia
you guys did a great job with these ear buds.
even the packaging is impressive!
to be fair...
"for the past 7 or 8 years, i bought cheap ear buds in bulk because each pair would only last a couple of weeks before one of the wires broke"
and i couldn't hear through them any more.
"so this time, i spent money looking for a beefier cable"
so maybe i wouldn't have the hassle any more.
holy cow!!!  
what
a difference in sound quality!!!!  
i have been enjoying lovemotives meditations on youtube and sonic elevator with their healing frequencies and binaural beats but these headphones take it all to the next level!!!
i'm absolutely blown away!!!
i'm quite disappointed about how these headphones turned out.  
"they come in lovely packaging, an almost over the top box, etc.  "
"a large array or different sized ear inserts, foam and rubber, and little pouch to keep the headphones in."
the big but however is that they cause a static crackle on my macbook.  
the crackle is mostly audible to the people i'm talking with on videoconferences.  
"since i bought the headphones to use mostly with my mac, that makes them unusable."
"they are made of nice solid-feeling metal, and i wonder if that metal construction isn't part of the problem."
"seemed like great value, but in the end were not."
bought the other sephia model of 'non' heavy bass version of these earbuds a few weeks back.  
"they were much closer sounding (crisp, definitive) to the original samsung headphones i was trying to replace, than about 8 or so other sets i'd tried from local stores here in town, & another vendor or 2, from amzn.  "
"they juuust lacked that 'little bit of 'extra' bass', &, a 45* or so angled wire lead, from the earbud (&, a phone mic).seen"
"this 3060 set (of course, after the fact) & figured, since the others were that good, &, so close... eh..."
i'll give'em a try.  
"for me, these sound just fine; possibly, a tad better than the samsung buds i replaced.  "
"[mind you, i'd ordered the microphone version, yet, received the non microphone version.  "
"otherwise, probly 5 stars.  "
"just got'em, so, may still check into a correction exchange & give an update & adjust the rating]only design feature that i'd ask for consideration in changing/altering, make the wire leads from the earbuds either, more of a 45* angle, instead of 90"
"*, to help allow a little more of a snugger earbud fit."
"other than that, for those that are use to &/or prefer good clean, full, crisp sounding earbuds, vs, the hollow tube sound with too many other earbuds"
"(& i realize, 'good sound' may vary from person to person)... &, for under or around $13--, i'd def recommend checking out these 3060 earbuds.  "
note
*
"i was not paid nor offered any discount in any way, shape or form for this review.  "
enjoy.  
peace !
"i was hesitant to order these earbuds, i'd never heard of the brand and the price was so low."
"on the other hand, for $10.95 not a lot to lose if i don't like.  "
turns out these are great sounding earbuds!!
"i especially like the cord, it's coated in soft plastic, less likely to get tangled up.  "
we'll see how long they last
i hope for a while.  
"so far very impressed, especially for the price!"
cons:
this pair seems to have electric static whenever in use.
it is very annoying.
if you are listening to something very loud the sound quality is fine.
something quieter
and it is noticeable that the left earbud is not nearly on the same level as the right.
pros:
they do a good job at canceling noise compared to similar pairs.
like most people nowadays i use earbuds on a daily basis.
i don't like to spend tons because with kids you just don't know when something is going to get broken.
"i had been puchasing skull candy because in the past i've always been satisfied with their products, but lately they have not been as good."
"i needed a pair of headphones that were durable, good sound quality and won't lose sound on one side within a reasonable amount of time."
i've had these for about a month now
and so far i have been impressed.
"the sound quality is good ( comparable to skull candy), and they seem to be made with decent materials."
they don't feel cheap at all.
"i like that the cord is wrapped in a more durable material than i am used to, and so far am happy with their performance."
"i haven't gotten more than a few months out of my skull candy ones, so am anxious to see how these do."
i bought these headphones to replace a pair of old samsung ones that finally fell apart on me.  
so far i'm really enjoying the headphones.
the noise cancellation works pretty well and the sound quality was way better than my previous pair.
the only complaint that i have is that they slide of my ears a little bit.
these headphones come with several different buds you can play with
and i haven't had time to do so
so there may be a pair that can fix this problem
but i cant say for sure.
"other then that, they are a great pair of headphones for the price and i would recommend."
these have been the best headphones i think i’ve ever had besides my beads.
i use these for my nintendo switch when i cannot have the volume on.
"the noise cancellation is great considering the price, the noise quality is amazing, and although i use my beats to work out i have a feeling these would stay in your ears very well"
if you were to work out with them.
i also love that they come with a lot of tips to put on for multiple ear shapes.
you’re really able to get a custom fit that won’t budge.
i highly recommend these
i love the sound on the headphones.
"the noise cancellation is great too, but i can’t get over how bad the insulation on the wiring is."
"any time i build up any static or whenever i plug in my phone while the headphones are in as well, the volume controls go up and down on their own."
which as you can imagine is annoying.
great sounding earbuds for a great price!
"great bass, nice mids and highs."
comes with a ton of different sized buds for a custom fit.
very little wire noise as some earbuds have a lot of noise when the wire hits or scrapes against something.
noise isolation is on par with similar earbuds.
overall happy with these
and they come at a great cheap price for a quality earbud.
definitely will buy again if needed.
a++
"the sound quality is good, in fact, better than the basic earpieces that come with your cellphone."
but not enough to recommend it.
"the earbuds keep slipping off, even when not moving much, nevermind wearing it for a jog or run."
tried all the foam sizes-- no go!not practical.
"if you're hardly moving and can constantly keep fixing the pieces into your ears, then, go for it."
"if you're looking for a practical design & be mobile, waste your money elsewhere."
the sound was okay but not terrific.
"more importantly, the left wire pulled out of the earpiece"
and i had to get new headphones.
"i do use headphones daily, but i'm not rough with them."
"after use, they always go back into a little protective case i have."
"so, these really should have lasted more than a few months."
these are just okay.
"the audio is clear, but just on the verge of tinny."
"still listening for that ""heavy deep bass,"" but it hasn't appeared yet."
good price and the wires provide good signal reception.
my initial reaction to these headphones has been pretty good.
"the sound quality is high, the material quality is good and the headphones seem durable enough."
they even give you 7 different options of silicone earbuds to ensure the best fit.
"the problem is, two of these ear buds are made of foam (one red, one black) and do not have any sort of shaping to keep them attached to the headphones themselves like the silicone ones do."
"i figured they would be more noise cancelling, (which they were) but the very first time i used the foam ends"
i had one very easily slip off and get stuck inside my ear!
"there is no kind of lip inside them to help keep them attached, i would not encourage using the foam tips at all."
it's not worth the risk.
"i'll go back to the silicone ones however, and i should be able to continue enjoying the product."
iphone earphones broke
"so i found these for a good price and good reviews, so"
i took a chance on them.
"i'm very happy with these, the sound quality is not quite as crisp as the apple earphones"
but it is still very good.
"however, these are very comfortable unlike apple earphones."
"after wearing apple for a while my ears will start hurting, these are very comfortable and have no problem with them."
will buy again
the noise cancellation is amazing and so it the sound quality.
i bought these for my plane trip from west coast usa to europe and they were perfect.
couldnt hear anything but
the music or audio book and the bass was great too.
definitely recommend.
i sleep with these and honestly can only hear what i'm listening to.  
they are comfortable enough for a side sleeper.  
the only issue -
"and i mean that lightly - would be that the wire doesn't ""lay"" since it is indeed a wire...  "
"it does not detract from what it is intended to do, which is great sound with noise cancellation!"
"remember, you get what you paid for.  "
the left
ear bulb went out first.  
"i got along with just one ear bulb, but now the other bulb went out as well.  "
i do not recommend this product for anyone.  
need to contact the company to see if i can get another set.  
not hoping though as it is six months old.  
waited too long.  
my mistake.
i've been using this for 2 weeks but the right earphone went bad.
moving the cable causes an intermittent sound.
i will not recommend this product.
very disappointed.
"these earbuds are great if you’re sitting still, but the shielding is terrible.  "
"they are practically unusable if you are wearing any kind of static generating clothing, like work out shorts.  "
try to use them while they are in your pocket and you’re moving and the static electricity causes the volume to decrease all the way down.  
i tried setting my phone on the treadmill
"so the wire wasn’t in my pocket,"
"well that didn’t work either, apparently the treadmill generated interference too."
"these look good but with all the different pieces it comes with, either the small rubbers don't fit onto the headphone or the ones that do, don't stay in my ear."
constantly falling out of my ear.
and the rubber pieces also fall off the headphone itself.
the sound is good.  
but if it only stayed in the ear.
day 1:
just got these headphones and so far they are pretty good.
it's the first use
so i am hesitant to give heavy praise.
"the sound is good, it's clear and crisp."
the volume on my computer isn't high at all and the audio is pretty great.
the quality of the materials does seem a bit cheap but with that being stated for the price of these headphones it's not really a bad thing.
"i definitely recommend buying these, the price is very cheap for the quality of sound you are receiving."
i will update after some time.
needed some new earphones.
works great in my laptop and phone.
really love them.
comes in a cool package.
very clear quality.
noise isolating.
comes with an assortment of earphone attachments...
some even i've never seen before.
includes a cool bag too.
i'm very happy with this purchase.
would recommend.
it has some bass if you use the ear pieces with smaller openings.
overall sound quality is excellent though & these are certainly an incredible overall value.
i was hoping for more bass (punch)
but maybe i’m being unrealistic for in ear headphones.
i’m certainly not disappointed though because the price point is excellent.
the skip song function worked for about 10 minutes then stopped working.
i sent an email to the company in the uk but never received a reply.
it's really too bad because the sound was pretty good for $13.00 earphones.
i could hear the music perfectly over my lawn tractor.
"i'm very hard on earbuds, even when i try to be more gentle"
but they just never last for me.
these ones have stood quite the unintentional beating very well so far
& i love them!
sound quality and noise cancellation are excellent and i love the comfort they provide!
"excellent clarity and bass; well made, superior workmanship and materials."
i also love the flat case they provide
"so you can comfortably carry your headphone in your pocket, various size earpiece adaptors are provided as well."
excellent price for the performance they provide!
"i've had these headphones for a couple days now, and have been very pleased."
"the sound quality is quite good, and i can turn down the volume compared to other headsets because of the sound quality."
"it comes with several different sizes of ear buds, which i haven't explored yet."
"overall, very happy with the purchase."
these earbuds work great
and i love that they come with a variety of different rubber
ends
so i could find the size that works best for my ears.  
"i really appreciate the well-made, high quality, and value"
i feel i received from this purchase.
i was just looking for an upgrade from skull candy.  
got these and am really impressed.  
i work in an open concept office and have a hard time concentrating with all the conversations going on around me.  
the noise cancellation is great and the price was right!
"for a set of earbuds at this price range, i wasn't expecting a lot."
"imagine my surprise when not only did i have to turn the sound in my playback devices down, because these ear buds were so much better than my regular headphones, but while working with machinery, the noise cancellation let me listen to a regular audiobook with no problems."
"my only complaint is that they don't stay fully set in my ears, so i have to readjust them every so often, but it's such a minor problem"
i don't mind it at all.
"there are a lot of expensive ear wear that are out there, but, these sephia earbuds are amazing!!!"
being a music lover
the sound quality and bass quality are just about as good as some of the high priced items that are out there!
a must purchase....
"and for the price, i made a wise choice in getting them."
"you won't be disappointed, trust me!!"
oh and they're very comfortable too.
even with the smallest buds these are too tight for my ear canals.
additionally when inserted the metal housing presses against my ear.
can only tolerate for a few minutes.
these probably work well for larger ears.
just used these last night .  
my husband goes to bed
but i am a night owl.  
i can use  them any time.  
the foam buds fit  perfectly  
but if not they send many others to get the most comfortable fit.  
highly reccomend..
i found out the ear piece covers are not of the best quality.
plus i could not get them to stay in my ear unless i took the cover off.
but then again someone else may have better luck with the ear piece covers.
they are a little heavy feeling also.
"bought 2 pairs, one for me and one for hubby to do our online spanish course."
best buds we've ever had.
they actually fit my little ears without pain and they stay in.
sound quality excellent!
"love ot,"
"high quality and the noise canllation works perfect, also very comfortable"
i'm getting small shocks while using these ear buds.
it's like rubber your feet on carpet and then sticking your finger in your ear.
tiny shocks.
i like them because they are small and fit more comfortably in my ears.
these things are terrible and will emit little shocking sensations in your ears as soon as you start to walk.
the seller tried to tell me this is normal.
i seriously doubt such discomfort should be acceptable.
poor quality.
"these are really well made, packaged nice and sound great!"
can't beat the price!
"we bought a pair of these for sleep and travel (flying, airports ...)."
they're outstanding.
"great sound, fit nicely, durable."
fantastic little carrying case.
highly recommended.
ordered these as a quick replacement for my old panasonic pair that finally wore out.
the packaging for this was so nice
i was actually kinda shocked.
tested out the sound
and it's nice and loud and clear.
not as crisp as the akg pair that originally came with my galaxy s9 (i keep those as my at work pair) but this is still a solid pair of earbuds for the price.
"the silvery details are a nice touch but lets be real, i dont care what my earbuds look like."
"these earphones are amazing, not only for the price point but also everything else."
"the sound is great, the bass is excellent."
noise cancellation is great (i use these for study in nursing school) and the extra ear pieces in different sizes including two sets of memory foam ones are great.
there's also a clip you can use to attach the earphones to your shirt or something
so they don't catch on anything.
great job to this manufacturer
look well built but they are so distorted that i only hear bass..
no highs or mids..
just base.
i use other headphones on my devices and everything is fine.
lasted longer than the rest so far.
i've gone through about 5 pairs of various headphones as it's always the 3 mm jack connector getting damaged or pulled -eventually making the headphones dead.
not the case with this one so far.
the sound quality is really nice!
crisp highs deep lows!
i really like them a lot.
"they're a little big, or maybe i have little ears, they slowly creep out of my ears."
either way i still enjoy using them.
sturdy set of headphones.
only had them for a few months so we will see how they do at year's anniversary.
sound is good.
nice little pouch to keep them in.
i am very pleased with theses in-ear headphones.  
i like that they have a little weight to them and
are donot tangle easily.  
they look and feel superior.
i'm glad i chose these.
the wire for this is quite stiff and i have been unable to use it for a telephone.  
possibly it isn’t designed for this purpose.  
i haven’t used them as intended because i need to read the directions again to see if plug and play isn’t appropriate.
these are very nice in ear headphones.
"the sound is excellent and with the multitude of tips provided, you will find one to fit your ears perfectly."
i really like the thin corded material....
not too stiff and not too limp.
"these are my ""go to"" corded ear buds from now on."
microphone worked one day and now is up and down in volume to listening party.
good price
"but, microphone basically failed after one day."
sound quality is very good!
love these ear buds!
"i use them at work in ""cubicle world"" where things can become noisy quick!"
these were perfect for some good listening to easy music while working my caseload.
amazing earbuds.
exactly what i was looking for.  
"arrived in good condition,  arrived in 2 days and are super clear and loud."
very happy
the wire insulation separated from the ear buds after 7 months.
i was excited about this product.
"it was working well but after a couple months, the right ear piece is not working..."
i rarely even use this ... :-/
i am pleasantly surprised at the sound of these ear plugs.
i do not have to turn the volume all the way up to hear better.
definitely recommend these.
they worked pretty good.
but i gave them to my son 1 month ago for his birthday and they’re broken already.  
so it gets a piece of junk review
i'm very pleased with these earphones.
"the sound is great and the wires are very strong, ear pieces fit great."
would buy again.
one of the earbuds became very noticeably quieter after only 2 months.  
"no contact info to exercise the one year warranty, but at least amazon customer service came to the rescue!  "
my son liked the headphones to order them again rather than get the refund.  
"hopefully, this is a one off issue, and the next one will last a reasonable time."
i listen to music and podcasts on my phone and sound quality is excellent.
"i don't know what ""sound isolation"" is supposed to be, but it isn't noise cancelling, which is what i assumed."
"that being said, the sound quality is still excellent."
"the volume control doesn't work on this earphone, with one press on the volume up / + the volume will go all the way up without stoping, and with one press of the volume down / - the volume will go all the way down to silent"
", i can't adjust the volume use the volume control on this earphone."
"i am not sure this the design flaw or i received a defective earphone,  very disappointed."
"i am not normally a fan of earbuds, but these have been a very pleasant surprise."
they are comfortable ( as comfortable as earbuds can be) and the sound is very good.
now i can listen to my audiobooks and music whils .y
husband watches tv.
"great overall, very good noise cancelation and good sound quality."
the length of the cord is just a bit on the short side so not good for pockets in pants.
destruction of headphones was great seems like after a couple weeks tone went down a lot
but still good worth of amount
i bought this product a while now
and it’s still working well.
it does everything it says it will.
loved the way these ear phones have a cord that doesn't tangle.  
"they are very comfortale, well made and fairly priced."
great sound and very comfortable.
good alternative for me
", i'm tired of losing"
/misplacing a single pod.
i like to get up very early
n
the morning and listen to worship music.  
these are perfect
so i don't disturb sleeping hubby!
"decent sound quality, very comfortable to wear."
the deep bass sound advertised is not present.
better bass from the cell phone speaker.
i go through earbud quite frequently.  
i am impressed these have held up nicely and have a great sound quality.
good quality and sound
but like most ear buds....they don't last long....
they start going in and out after a few months of having them
this is my second pair.
i think they work well and the sound is fine.
fair price for a good product.
won't stay
i ears.
looks odd drinking out of ear.
didnt use them till now and now can't return
"bought two different earbuds same price, wife prefers other pair over these."
that 15hz makes a huge difference!
awesome headphones!!
"clarity, flexible cord, comfort,"
low tones
- they have it all!
"sound quality great, noise cancellation great."
"fell out of ears a bit but not really an issue for me, and i probably could have solved if i used the many replacement buds provided."
it worked for 4 months of minor abuse (pressing on the side of the plug).
"both earbuds detached from the plastic covering of the wires, but that wasn't what killed them."
they do what i need them to do.
"i normally get skull candy or ifrogz, but these are just as good and will probably buy more in the future if i have to."
these are the best headphones honestly!
i just bought a second pair.  
i love them!!
very good sound quality
and they come with a variety of sizes for the ear piece so that you can find just the right fit!
"truly worth giving them a try, especially for the price.  "
very satisfied with this product!!
love the quality of the sound!!!!
they are a great value....would definitely recommend these
i was surprised by the solid metal construction.
"they're very comfortable, and they come with plugs for all size and shaped ears."
i especially like the foam ones personally.
"the base is definitely noticeably higher with these than my other audio equipment, but not to the point of being jarring or anything."
muddy bass and no mid-range.
the high end is unimpressive as well.
"zero noise cancel,  other than that very good sound.."
"thank you, a.r.c."
i like that there is different size ear tips as i needed the smallest size.
"great sound and bass, great price!"
"unfortunately the mic is messed up on macbook pro, so i had to revert to my old headset."
"so beware if you have a macbook pro, it might not work for"
"that.(one pair got lost in the mail, so i ordered another pair, eventually the original pair got to me as well, both had the same issue)"
"these lasted a few months, decent sound, but should have lasted longer"
"got a pair of these in august 2019 and liked them for ""walk the dog"" earbuds.  "
lost one of the cushions
so i ordered a couple of replacements.  
the original pair included a start/stop/volume/microphone control.  
the replacements don't.
great for my 15 year old ipod.
sound was 100% better.
"ear phones are comfortable, nice quality & were received quickly from the seller."
i love these earphones.  
the packaging was very smart!
wow so far so good best that i've tried yet without breaking the bank!
these were a present for my grandson and he loved them.  
said they are the best pair he ever had.
i bought these for my fiance when he needed a new pair of headphones.
he loved these until he ended up breaking these.
he used them everyday and loved the way that music sounded on them.
awesome sound.
gives multiple ear pieces so you can find the ones that fit best.
seems like it's pretty heavy duty wire.
love them!
todo bien pero no sé si
seré yo pero me molestaron un poco los oídos luego de quitármelos me
quedó una
molestia no son cómodos o al menos hay otros más cómodos
if you're on a budget these are probably some of the best $10 earbuds around..
surprisingly good sound for the price
they work much better then i thought.
definitely a keeper
i love the packaging.  
and the quality is on point.
awesome earbuds!!!!works very good
exactly what i was looking for with a microphone.
best product
like it a lot great sound and love the bass
this headphones work great for my teenager and the fact of the braided wire they seem to be lasting longer than others in the past.
"came broken , left bud produces no sound do"
not purchase
"well packaged, heavy duty cable to last, carrying case for travel"
and they sound great!
great product.
"nice fit, comfortable."
wires are protected.
a 'right's sound
and i do not recommend this unit for music.
these are amazing earphones.
"they went thru my washer and dryer, and i thought they were done."
they still work!
i love these ear-phones!
this product lives up to the seller’s claim.
this earphone works great and gives a very good sound quality
love this product!!
i love it.
great bang for your buck.  
sleek sexy design
just a little too much base for my liking.
use headphones when i cut the yard.  
worked great!!!
"overall sound quality is there for the price point; however, the pair i received what a difference in volume between the right and left earbud."
"the right earbud was definitely louder, which was confirmed by other users."
"overall made for a poor experience, will have to get a different set of earbuds."
worst set of earbuds
i’ve ever purchased.
uncomfortable and doesn’t stay in ear.
"they are pretty to look at, but not worth the hassle."
disappointed.
watched 2 hour movie and didn't even notice i was wearing them the whole time.
very good quality!
i’ve spent on several sets over the last month.
these are clearly the best
"i've been buying $5-$15 headphones, using them until they break, and repeat."
finally decided to spend a bit more on something that will last (hopefully).
"so far it's been a month of daily use, and i'm happy with these!"
surprisingly good overall quality for the price.
these work very well with my iphone
good for the price
the volume controls on this thing are dangerous.
sometimes hitting the + button once will result in the volume to increase to max as if you were holding the + button.
this could seriously hurt someone's ears if theyre not careful.
excellent ear buds
love the sound quality and the overall quality of the materials used to make this product.
great item
awesome!!
great earbuds.  
excellent.  
fast shipping thank u
nice item
love these earbuds.  
exactly as described.
good .hd..
sound .clear
very happy with ear pods.
these are great!
"they isolate noise, are stylish and the sound is crystal clear!"
"also, if you are not a bulky head phones kind of person, these are easy to carry anywhere, in your purse, your pocket, doesn't matter."
i highly recommend them!
work well
very good quality.
you’re getting a $20 value at this price.
"came in a very nice package, the case is very convenient as well- small enough to fit in a pocket and protects the earbuds nicely."
the earbuds come with a very big selection of extra buds.
very good product overall.
for $13 these are good.
don't expect great sound.
"however, they produce good sound.  "
for $13 i have no complaints.
works great.
and they still havent ripped or any signs of damage after i've been tossing them around a lot.
so i would say they are pretty durable as well.
i received my sephia headphones and they are just as described.
they were for my husband and he is happy with them and says that the sound is good.
comfortable.  
good sound.
comfortable.  
good sound.
"great stuff, sound is very clear and loud."
product looks and feels great.
noise cancellation is an issue...
"even when the plugs are well within your ear drum, outside disturbance can still be heard at times."
the sound quality was amazing!
the quality of the headphones was also amazing.
i bought them to use on an old sony mp3 player.
i never knew it could produce that much sound.
glad i bought the headphones.
sturdy headphones which replaced my old ones which i accidentally karate chopped to death.
"haven't chopped these yet, but they seem like they're would survive."
as described
this is very nice...
u listen.
and tell me!
could  use  better ear pads.
i bought these earbuds to use with my samsung galaxy to listen to music and to use with my laptop to watch movies on netflix...
the sound quality is very crisp and clear while using these earbuds...
very good product... i would recommend this product...
"great sound, shame both pair broke!"
and amazon no long carry's them!
purchased warranty!
perfect for my daughter.
and shipping and package was perfect
they feel loose in my ear.
i have not tested the noise conciliation.
nice!
what can i say?
great inexpensive pair of ear bud headphones
and it came with extra attachments for the right fit and
the sound is superb!
does not fit iphone xr.
i really like the sound quality of the headphones when listening to music.  
i have not experienced the noise cancellation feature yet.  
only gave 4 stars on the comfort because nothing feels comfortable in my ear to me.
don't buy wires tangle easy
perfect
great sound!
i like these a lot
great earbuds and great price.
very comfortable in my ear
and i love that the wires don't get tangled up.
and great little case to carry it in
good product
nice
like it
"these headphones are really awesome: good bass, good durability, good noise cancellation."
best for the lowest price you can find.
this is a great pair of earphones.  
i would recommend them highly.  
great price too
very durable and comfortable in ears.
good sound.
seems like it last longer than the regular ones.
these earbuds do not stay in my ears.
"tried all the different sizes, they fall out, very unhappy"
awesome highly recommended
great
sound quality is excellent !!
"these buds get everything right: price, durability, excellent design, great sound."
highly recommended.
i'm a musician
and i crave for sound quality in everything.
these headphones are amazing and have been surprising me since i purchased them.
they have good highs and middles...
"the bass could be a little bit better, but for a pair of earbuds, they are excellent."
love them.
been jamming since i got them.
i have been enjoying the experience these earphones provide.
awesome quality and will now be my go to for earphones.
would recommend to anyone.
still waiting to see how long they will last but has exceeded my expectations so far.
i loved them!  
even the little extra they come with
among the better headphones i've used.
very good sound quality
this product is value for money
had it 1 week and one side stopped working.
you'd think at this price point they would last long than gas station ear buds.
good
amazing sound quality and they fit comfterbly in my ears amazing thanks for the extra accessories will buy again.
"my wire cracked, but i think it happed during my move."
i'm reordering.
"good sound quality, great price"
nice
"everything the same as my first review, but now the sound went out in one of the sides."
can’t use like that.
it looks like i've actually bought the wrong item.
i didn't realize that this did not come with a microphone which is what i needed.
it is a nice product though.
i've already used it
so i guess i can't return it and will keep them.
nothing great about it.
it works and that's it!
i've used the headphones for about two weeks
and i like it.
it seems to be a well-made product.
i like the carrying pouch that comes with it.
it's really nice quality
nice sound and a good fit with all the variety of ear pieces.
these are the best ear buds i could find for the price.
was pleasantly surprised to find they were so great.
bought as a lightning deal.  
the wires have permanent creases where it was folded and it won't straighten.  
very annoying.
use them at work.
better than my old iphone set and smaller profile than boise.
these suck.
they sound like a cheap am radio from the 70's: scratchy and no bass at all.  
"nice looking, though."
tried on different treadmills at my gym and
all those times the sound quality was bad.
i have to wiggle where you insert the cord in order to hear on both ears several  times.
not strong and lasted only 3 months!!
sound quality is surprisingly good.
comes with extra earbuds.
"very good product, and inexpensive to boot."
i’m happy
quality seems good.
"i use them when biking, so noise cancellation was important and a sturdy long lasting cord."
so far so good.
"so far, only had them for a week, i have no complaints."
comfortable to wear.
sound quality is good.
construction seems sturdy.
nice product
outstanding sound
you just have to get use to it ......
more bass no question about it
......
i'll buy again : )
"sound is good, byt difficult to position in ear and stay put."
i gave these very smart looking headphones as office gifts to my coworkers at christmas.
they all love them.
i really like the wire that doesn't get tangled and the case to keep it safe.
the earphone was the best i have by far.
i like the mix of the vocals & instruments specially the bass which is very much pronounce.
the quality is good with affordable cost ...
i like this product!
good
had this product for 2 weeks and they just recently started shocking my ears when i wear them.
"it sounds weird, but it happens."
i personally wouldn't reccomend them.
oh my god.
that's all i have to say.
sound quality is as high as snoop dog gets on the weekends.
"thank you, just thank you."
"if it's the seller that's reading this, let me know:)."
not as advertised.
very basic sound quality.
ordered the sony mdr
xb5 today - 3 days after using this
i own three pairs of these earphones.
this specific pair died after only a couple months.
very disappointed.
the product is ok.
but the person who delivered at my house live olmos in the street
my itim
and i pay amazon prime wow
daughter needed earphones and said these work great.  
i like the price.
sounds amazing with incredibly good bass.
"premium feel with the metal make, a lot of bud size options, the convenient and discrete pouch makes this a bang for the buck."
"so they arent bad, and i didnt expect a lot from it,"
"hey maybe i'm just unlucky, but they keep cutting out randomly"
and it's slightly irritating
sturdy cord and ear pieces with several size options.
"only complaint is that the microphone is not very good, you have to speak directly into it, and the volume adjustment is hit or miss."
yes very nice even when i accidentally wash it still works thanks
these work great and price right!
"comfortable to wear, noise cancellation works quite well."
sound quality is.
"it the best i heard, but it is good."
these are definitely the best headphones you can find under $20
these are definitely the best headphones you can find under $20
high quality low price
"great sound, lot's of sizes for different ear sizes, good buy."
these are the only earbuds i have ever used that consistently shock the inside of my ears while plugged into my computer.
"good sound and quality construction, especially considering the price."
excellent buy for the price
"i love these headphones, the pouch makes it easy to carry and keep them tangle free in my gym bag."
outstanding quality earbuds!
definitely recommend.
work well!
the packaging alone was worth the price.
everything is 1st class including the sound.
"i really like the sound quality and bass capability of these, they are also really comfortable to use."
"awesome sound , even with my bad hearing, love them"
"sound good for the price, and accidentally ran them through the wash in my jeans pocket twice"
and they still work.
not a thing
they work perfectly sound great the look is nice
wow
oh wow..
what a difference!
very good quality ear buds with great sound.
these in ear headphones arrived quickly.
they are well priced and have great sound.
i'm very happy with them.
worked great.  
comfortable on the ears
these are just as amazing as my best headset
i really can’t find anything wrong with this product.
better than expected!
"i'm no audiophile, but i know when something sounds great and these headphones do!"
comfortable with a good sound.
i used the headphones for a few weeks before one of the ear buds started shocking the inside of my ear.
i won't buy these again.
would have given 5 stars
but  one of the earphones  went out.
really good ear buds!!!
"loud,good sound, pretty sweet bass."
it’s perfect
"exelent product, well made."
so far so good
much better quality than expected.
i needed more bass than what my phone's earbuds provided.
the entire sound range is richer.
thank you.
"nice ear pods, sound really good!"
right earphone is louder than the left.
for some reason whenever i reposition the cables the sound becomes normalize but this is only a temporary fix.
great for the price!
length and material of cord are great including the price.
i love everything about this product.
i ordered a second pair just to have.
i told my 2 sons and nephew to purchase a pair before they're sold out.
these are heavy.
i didn’t expect that.
they weight makes them slide out of my ears often.
"other than that, i love them"
"the sound is great, however i bought these thinking it came with a mic, and it doesn’t."
so it was a waste of money.
good sound though.
"these work perfectly with my macbook pro, and they do a better job at noise-cancelling than standard apple earbuds."
great quality for the price!
my daughter loves them.
she said the sound and sound cancelation is great.
so far i can't complain.
"but as a backup set, i could not ask for more."
the sound is good and the fit perfect.
sound quality is pretty good.
i like how it looks also.
very reasonable price for this great quality headphones.
good price for quality item
my daughter loves them.
with six siblings she is finally able to sit back and enjoy some peace without constant interference
very happy with the product.
better than the original set that came with the phone
i'm not a headphone connoisseur but these get the job done well.
great sound!
by far the best sounding
ear buds i've ever owned.
"this product is awesome, clearer, more solid pair of head phones, truly think it is a great product."
very satisfied with the overall quality of these ear buds.
sound quality is very good.
great quality for the price.  
definitely
"the right earbud buzzes, and it feels like it’s shocking me."
how have these had only 5 star reviews so far?
excellent sound quality and the customizable ear buds make it a really great product to own
"they bump, just as good as the beats"
but they don't last very long.
normal wear and tear they will last about 2 months.
very comfortable to wear.
"the bass is a deep rich sound if you love bass, being i'm a bass player i listen for that bottom first."
the sound is incredible.  
i am able to listen at a reduced volume n order to get the same response that i had with the hones this replaced.
multiple size ear buds...not just small medium and large.  
plus a bag to hold the ones not in use.
good idea!
great sound
they are good
these are probably the best headphones i've ever owned and at a very reasonable price.
i really like them.
works as intended.
i like the little bag you can store them in.
works as intended.
i like the little bag you can store them in.
great sound and a nice and long cord.
overall a good buy for the price!
also comes with alot of extra eartips and a small carrying bag for them which is nice.
rich and heavy bass.
decent noise cancelation.
can't go wrong for the price.
"the headphones don't fit your ears as well as they should, and the noise cancellation is non existent."
these head phones are so awesome!
"very good ear piece except for the comfort, the ear buds keep falling off"
wish they
had volume control and on off switch.
they don't last long.
the right one is broken now in about 5 1/2 months of light use.
"very high quality, especially at this price point."
totally satisfied.
it is excellent
great sound and very clear!
loved these.
great quality for the price
great earbuds for my phone
i'd like the product ..
amazing... recommended....
these are fantastic!
they went through the washer and dryer without even a single problem!
"great quality product, it looks made to last..."
"i love it, the sound is so clear and balanced"
i use it for listing to music on my phone.
for earbuds they are very comfortable to wear and it wont bother my ears.
excellent high quality headphones.
they are comfortable and durable.
would recommend.
"they felt great, they sounded amazing"
the problem i had is that they stopped working after two days
all was good but plug in broke off while mowing the lawn
that is super earphone.
i love it.
it only took 2 weeks until one earphone stopped working.
the price was awesome..
the bass is awesome..
the sound is awesome
love it!
completely happy with my purchase.
i will order more for my grandkids.
the bass is good with these headphones
and i would definitely recommend these headphones.

worth more than the price
these looked good but they don’t work!
none
"there's nothing quite like having to mess with a previously-working bluetooth marriage just before starting your workout, or dealing with battery issues."
neither are a worry with these headphones.
correction:
there is something worse than reestablishing a bluetooth connection and battery issues.
having to constantly mash your wired earbuds in your ears every 10 seconds while exercising to keep them from falling out.
why aren't there more over-
the-ear headphone options for wired earbuds?
"why?!!!for runners, especially, this pair of earbuds is a godsend."
i'd knock just a *half* star if i could for the sound quality.
"yes, there's a lot of bottom end bass."
"too much, really."
it comes at the expense of the crispness and detail of the higher end.
"but, if you aren't an audiophile (like 99% of the population), this won't be an issue."
"if you are an audiophile, then shame on you for looking at a $15 pair of earbuds to begin with."
oh...that's right...
this is about the only pair of over-the-ear wired earbuds on amazon.
i forgot.
"after only 2 weeks of use, one of the earphones started to have sound problems."
"i take care of the cord and the earphones, so i'm pretty sure it's nothing i did to damage it, but now the earphone only works when the cord happens to be in a certain position."
"in addition, the other earphone doesn't fit quite right."
"“i had problems with the first pair of earphones that i purchased, but the seller contacted me and offered a refund and replacement."
"they were attentive and helpful, so i ended up having a positive experience with them"
my usage- sleep (they stay in most of the time.
sometimes they pop out when i wake up
but it's still good)- exercise (
"with the hooks, earbuds never fall out)- travel- music ("
youtube)- online calls (discord)for buyerslength of cord
": i'm a little more than 5ft, so it fits well with me."
for anyone who may be much taller this may not satisfy youtangle-prone: be sure you manage your cords carefully with any products like thisproduct qualityepic for its price!sound quality:
amazing compared to most popular cheap earbuds.
"compare to ""panasonic, ergonomic earbuds with mic""hook-on earbuds:"
"flexible and comfortable, soft silicone texturestable clip:"
the cords never fall out when running.
i recommend using a screw to slowly widen that little hook for the cord to go throughdurability:
they last longer than some cheap earbuds i've used in the pastin-ear:
"my ears are very small,"
so i love itcustomer servicei
thoroughly enjoy this product you guys got together!they are very considerate and tend to the needs of the customer in a timely manner.
i got my new pair after i told them about my concern about sound being cut out from the volume control buttons.
i feel bad for not yet being able to send back the product for them to figure out how to fix it.
"regardless, i will buy more of this in the near futuresuggestionscord: try braided cables, so that it does not tangle as muchdurability of the control buttons: i had an issue with a disconnection of wiring, which caused one side of my earbud-sounds to get cut off."
mic quality: i had to keep bending the mic in such a way towards the hole of the mic for people to hear me better)cord joint on sound-piece
could use some improvements as well.
i see some pulling can possibly affect the earbud connection on the inside.[before
i had a 5 star
but now 4 since i'm not allowed to post links as reference for the suggestion below]
these are the best headphones ever!  
"i don't exercise with them, but was looking for something to wear when i go to bed to listen to relaxation cd's.  "
these work great!  
the sound is very good and they stay in my ears.  
the design is excellent.  
they are easy to get on and off and seem very durable.  
i highly recommend them if you are in the market for headphones that aren't wireless.
"wish it was just a few inches longer, at 6'3"" putting them under my shirt and phone in my pocket, when using the clip at the neck of my shirt to keep the cord from tugging on my ears, the cord is a just a hair short"
these headphones are great.
my wife loves them
but i think the ones i received are defective.
they cracked in just 3 days.  
"i am reaching out to amazon for a replacement,  "
hopefully i will be able to change my review to 5 stars
so disappointed.
i’d give it 0 stars if i could.
the headphones didn’t work.
i was really looking forward to using them especially since they fit my ear perfectly and were really comfortable.
i’ve been emailing back and forth with their customer service and think this will be resolved soon or i will just return to amazon and purchase a different brand.
i wish i had listened to the reviews before buying.
"i got a reply within a day of placing the review bellow, stating my ailments with my first pair."
being the person i am
"i didn't see it until 3 days later, then got a replacement set in probably 3-4 days ( and then saw the email 2 days afterwards lol and checked the mail and found it there)."
"like i said in my original quarry, since it was comfortable and had great sound quality."
put to 3 stars until i can get past the first 15 days this time at least lol.
"if this set lasts a few months, i would give it 4-5 stars (depending on how the sound quality lasts), if it lasts four to five months i would give it 6 stars if i could."
update a few months later: still works amazingly.
5 stars.
"sound quality is still great, i bent the earpiece to hold on better to my ears and it is still comfortable."
i am loving this thing.
if this one goes out i'm definetly buying another.
i'll also keep this in mind in the next few years as a christmas present for family probably.
i had this pair for only 15 days and on the 10th day
"i think the left ear went almost silent, and then on day 14"
the right ear didn't put out anything at all.
so i'm not sure if i got a defective pair.
i'd really like that to be the story because otherwise this would be a five star all around
cause
these were so comfy and had pretty good sound for a 15 buck pair of earbuds...
"ear bands are massive & very flimsy, meaning if you want to use these from running they will effortlessly come out of your ears."
"on the upside this adds an entirely new element to your workout: keeping the headphones one, this will likely be your biggest challenge."
the sound quality is ok but that doesn't much matter when the earbud will bo so far removed from your ear that you might as well be using a speaker to listen to your music.
tldr: don't buy these.
"i rely on my headphones constantly to combat tinnitus, especially at night."
it wraps so gently but securely around my ears that switching sleep positions doesn’t hurt/tug/slip from my ears.
"when an accident damaged my earphones and i needed a replacement as soon as possible (the non-stop high buzzing from tinnitus so irritating that sleep became impossible,)"
"luffy, avantree’s customer service rep, is thorough, fast and kind."
"i will definitely be ordering more (if another accident happens, my purse, etc.)"
"can’t thank you enough, avantree!!"
right off the bat the connectivity is easy and very quick!
"straight to the point, i love everything about this product!"
they are very comfortable.
"the controls are very responsive and quick, which is very good!"
"pausing tracks is easy, just press the middle control button to pause it and again press it second time to play again."
"in short, i just loved them."
i get this especially for my work out routine and eventually i made a right choice.
it is so lite weight and so comfortable.
it won't come out from the ear during my cardio as well as other weightlifting.
it gives smooth and continuous sound experience.
another amazing thing is its battery life.
that is amazing.  
i loved it.
these things are awesome!i did lose the lil bits that are suppose to keep them in your ears
but they stay in good anyway.
had these earbuds for less than 1 week and the left earbud stopped working - will be returning
what is best though about these earphones is how easy it connects to the bluetooth device in my laptop.
"when the earphones first turn on, it will flash letting"
you know it is trying to pair.
i got onto my settings on my laptop and paired with bluetooth devices.
"within a few seconds, the earphones appeared and paired.  "
i highly recommend them!
i was on a mission to find a pair of quality headphones because mine recently broke.
these headphones have an excellent sound quality and i can use them at the office or home.
thanks to the noise canceling feature
i can continue private conversations and do my work.
thank you!
i'm a really picky person when it comes to earphones.
i've bought countless earphone and usually pay a minimum of $20.
i really needed some earphones quickly
and i was low on cash
so i bought these.
"i wasn't expecting much, but these sound and feel better than most earphones i've bought."
"it's hard to believe these are under $10, i would have gladly paid $30 for these."
"the bass sounds amazing and they feel really durable and with a 3-button remote, what more could anyone ask for?"
i'm already planning on rebuying these.
the headphones are cheap and durable.
it is great to wear to the gym and doesn't fall out.
"best part is that the pricing makes it so i don't really care if they break, but seems durable."
sound quality isn't the best
but stil gets the job done.
very good bass and mids.
"i was surprised to find that these sturdy, aluminium sound bullets reproduced the heavy, driving bass of windhand, spaceslug and sunn 0)))"
quite faithfully.
"not at the face-ripping level of a 15-inch sub woofer but just enough to make me thing, ""wow!"
"these don't suck!""i bought these as something to stash in my backpack in case of an emergency where i need to drown out the annoying whine of blathering travelers at airports or when i need some aural solace from the din of my noisy world."
i like that it has a built in mic.
i can plug it into my phone and talk to people .
the audio on the other end of the mic isn't the best; the highs are cut off so someone listening to me on the phone won't hear as crisply as if i was to hold the phone up to my head
but...i don't have to hold a phone up to my head
so there's that.
"if i could change one thing, it would be the permanent tendency of the beefy, well made cable to coil back up."
i would buy these again.
i might even buy a spare just in case.
i work in high end audio and for the price they're amazing.  
"a little tilted up in the bass making for a slightly boomy presentation, but i can forgive them for how inexpensive they are.  "
the build quality is very good.  
the use of aluminum makes for a quality
feel that way surpasses it's price point.
the cable feels substantial and the inclusion of multiple size
ear
pieces just adds to the value.  
"make no mistake, this won't compete with your ue's or utopia's"
but if you're in the market for a nice set of earbuds that you won't cry about if lost or damaged these should definitely be considered.
i wasn't expecting much for a pair of cheap ear buds
but these definitely deliver very good sound.
crisp voice and great bass.
have held up quite good
and i'm pretty hard on ear buds.
only complaint is the fit could be a bit better.
they come with different sized
ear nubs
but they don't quite stay in my ears as good as i'd want.
still not a huge deal
and i'd definitely buy another pair when needed.
never expected such a good quality from a earphones that is less expensive.
comes with noise canceling feature as well and convenient.
would definitely recommend this product.
i think these ear buds work okay for the price.
considering they cost less than $10 i wasn't expecting much.
the sound quality is decent and the bass was alright.
they have great sound quality both with talking on the phone and listening to music.
they do have a mic
and i have spoken to my husband several times while he’s been using them.
wonderful pair of headphones with great quality sound.
"the noise canceling is truly great and forthe price, is one of the best price in town and online.  "
"it come with a great black pouch to store,  so"
it don'tget tangled in wherever you store them.
i'll probably will get some more for  quick gifting.
i almost never find earphones that fit my apparently odd-shaped ear canals.
these fit like a proverbial glove.
"yes the cancel significant noise, and they provide truly decent sound."
and the price?
what's not to like?
i'm happy.
ordering more for backup.
"durable and good sound quality , much better than other earbuds"
i've bought for a similar price ( like skullcandy) .
they do seem to pop out of my ears a little easily but overall this is a great deal for the price .
finally found a pair that does what it is supposed to do.
excellent price also!
these earbuds are rrally have a high end sound.  
the bass unbelievable.  
a true steal for the price.
"i have tested them with jazz, classical and hip hop and they have truly out performed most of my high end iems.  "
sometimes if you're lucky you can find a cheap masterpiece.
work real well connected to the audio box while i’m  watching tv working out at the gym.
and my ears are old and don’t work as well as they used to.
no problem hearing with these.
prior to buying these adorer headphones i used to regularly purchase the panasonic ergofit headphones.
i am glad i decided to give the adorer headphones a try.
both of these products are around the same price but the adorer headphones have higher sound quality and better noise cancellation than panasonic's headphones along with higher durability from metal construction.
"on top of that, the microphone on the adorer headphones works when hooked up to a controller for the playstation 4 with clear voice quality."
"overall, this has to be the best deal for headphones on amazon, providing high end performance for under $10."
"after going through several ""cheap"" headphones and buds, i decided to ""splurge"" and go over $10 for these buds.  "
the cord and jack are small enough that the phone case does not have to be removed to plug the phones in.  
"while they are not marketed as noise cancelling, they may be parent cancelling as my daughter can't seem to hear anything other than what's playing in her ear buds.  "
"according to her, they're comfortable and sound great."
i am a habitual earbud destroyer.
i accidentally wash them or misplace them all the time.
because of this i have cycled through a fair number of different styles and brands.
these are by far the best ones i have ever owned.
i can't believe they are only $10?!?!
"very happy with this purchase, amazing quality, the noise cancellation is actually pretty good on  them."
i'm astounded- if you're looking for a great earbud for a low price with amazing sound and just in general a quality product-- choose these!!
no one needs to spend more than $10 for a decent quality sound.
i was blown away by this below $10 headphones.
"if somebody asks me ""do you need nose, sony, airpods,"
"beats?"".."
no is my answer...
audio -
the sound quality is the worst i have experienced in a few decades.
the bass is totally absent.
"i did not measure it with my lab equipment, but my estimate is that it does not reproduce any audio below 1,000 hz."
none.
"the audio sounds like it's coming from a tin can, tinnnnnny."
"(i am an electronics engineer, but still, tinnnnnny is the best word i can cpme up with to describe the performance of these...)i"
strongly suggest not buying these.
"i'm going to put them in my auto glove box, as a spare for driving directions."
"and if they arent even good enough for that, into the garbage."
noise cancelling -
there is absolutely none that i can detect.
"however, noise cancelling works only on lower frequencies, and since the lower frequencies are absent, i guess someone might argue that they are cancelled."
summary -
"these are very low quality, and i recommend not buying them.  "
"they are handsome, exactly as pictured on amazon."
i got the earphones a few days ago at first i was sceptical about it because of the price
but when i tried it surprise me the sound was great compare to branded earphones in the market.
the build quality is good for an earphone under $10
its all metal except remote/mic part all in all this product is a gem in amazon
the sound is great
i try to listen to a range of genre from classical to heavy bass edm for me
the bass is not that important
"i want the balance of everything the voice, the instrument and the high and low."
this product truly exceptional i highly recommended for the price and amazing sound quality
the only reason i did not give it a 5 stars rating is because of the durability  hopefully it will last for more than a year maybe in 6 months i'll give an update on this product.......
and i highly recommend is earphones you will be suprise like....
bravo to the maker of this earphones
my son needed these for school as well as use for online gaming at home.
he loves these earbuds and we got them at a great price.
"these do not look or sound like cheap earbuds, and if they hold up"
well i will be stowing a pair in every bag and briefcase
"i own, as well as in multiple bike jerseys, so i don't get caught without a pair."
"the controls work easily and perfectly, which is important to me, and books and podcasts sound fantastic."
"music sounds as good to me as on a much more expensive pair of buds, and the base doesn't boom-drown out the mid and higher tones."
ordered for my son’s school.
they need wired earbuds.
well designed.
my teenage is happy with the style.
i’m happy with a price.
if you also shopping for your kids school supply well recommended
"really like these earbuds, like others have mentioned, the price to value is outstanding.  "
"sounds are crisp, bass is more punchy and responsive than expected.  "
my only small complaints are: 1.
the metal detail (knurling)...
"they tend to lay against parts of my ear, and it isn't very comfortable.  "
"the ""rough"" metal knurling isn't a good finish for in-ear buds.  "
"this could just be my ears, it isn't uncomfortable, but i'd have preferred something other than cold rough metal.  "
i suppose the texture allows for better fingertip grip for inserting / removing the buds.  
2.
the cords are a little thick and stiff.  
"again, not a major complaint, but i bought these as a replacement for some akg's that came with my samsung note 9 and the braided cloth finish and more flexible wires were preferred over the thicker cord on these.  "
"again, not a deal breaker and i certainly think they smash expectations for the price."
you just can't do much better for the low-low price.  
i've certainly spent more for way less.
i like it!
the sound is clean and bass are good!
working well for now.
button volume and pause working too.
these earphones really do pack a punch for $10 and i'm honestly impressed.
i bought a pair on an impulse because the pair that came with my phone finally broke.
i would have bought something else at the supermarket i shop at but instead wanted to try something new.
"anyway, straight to the point."
i would say these earphones would be a solid 10/10
but the bass is a little too much for my liking but outside of that the sound quality is impressive.
i like that extra
ear pieces were included as well.
pair feels heavy and durable so hopefully months down the line they manage to hold up after daily use.
i tested the ear plugs and liked how it fit.
the cord is long enough gor movement.
i plan to use these on my flight to japan.
worth the money at this price for earbuds.
received these today and used them today at planet fitness!
best $9 bucks i have ever spent!
great sound and definitely noise cancelling!
"i listening to tv, music, and a youtube video of the blue angels!"
sound was fantastic for all!
thank you for a great product and super fast shipping!
this is probably the best most inexpensive earphones i have ever had in my freaking life!
i have rescue cats and one of them got into my room and ate my old buds.
"instead of buying the same earbuds that cost over $30 i decided to go with this pair, i figured i could get an inexpensive pair and just buy the kind i had before at a later time."
well that's not going to happen because these are amazing.
"usually when you buy earbuds at a low price they suck and the quality is garbage, but these are fantastic."
"i am very pleased with these earphones, they fit right and the sound is exceptional."
i can answer my phone and hangup with a press of a button.
i would recommend this product.
thank you jker teck service jker-tech.com.
i've only had these for eight hours
they don' work anymore.
when i first used them they sound quality was great.
"but from the beginning, neither the sound control or the powers button worked."
"then they got caught in the wheel of my wheel chair and plugged them into my phone, they no longer worked."
i examined the entire device from top top to bottom and the only damage i saw on the housing where the housing where the twires were connected.
and that was just an abrasion on the housing itself.
there appeared to be no damage to the wires themselves.
i've had other headphones that endure alot more wear and tear than that and lasted alot longer.
these were terribly made and really poor in quality.
i've had much cheaper ones than these an they worked better and lasted longer.
i am extremely disappointed!
i have added pictures to show the damage to the housing.
"let me start off by saying that i usually don't write much critical reviews, however, this product deserves it."
"even though it's cheap, it's only ten bucks, it's not even worth your penny."
and i also don't know how other people rated this so high.
"the thing is that i noticed strange behaviour of those earphones, they would randomly pause and/or switch to next song without my interference."
"also, my calls have been rejected few times."
"on top of this, two days ago the earphones literally died, i've only been using them for three weeks, now when i listen to music, i only have a karaoke party."
"songs are played without lyrics, i know what is it, it's damaged cord."
"i didn't do it, it's just chinese crap."
"i don't recommend buying this at all, go for something more expensive and better."
these had to have been a defective pair because all of the other reviews are great.
the volume automatically adjusts itself which is crazy-irritating.
i'll be commuting and out of nowhere the volume turns itself all the way up or all the way down.
the speaker picks up on everything and constantly asks me if i want to open google chrome on my phone.
there is zero noise cancellation and audio quality of a tin can.
"really disappointed, they're basically unusable."
that's the risk you run when you buy cheap headphones.
"with keeping in mind that these are cheaper headphones, the bass is good at lower to mid volume."
i wanted to use these in the gym as backup headphones for when my bluetooth headphones die.
i like to drown out all other noises when i'm in the gym
"and they didn't really block out everything, so i found myself raising the volume, which lead to kind of poor sound quality."
"also, the wire seems a lot longer than usual headphones, which is good and bad."
"it's annoying when you're walking around, but you'll knock your phone off the cardio machines a lot less."
"the last thing i didn't like was that it felt like the wire was kind of weighing down the earbuds, so as i did cardio i felt the earbuds slowly pulling out of my ears."
maybe it was because i needed to use a larger ear insert?
"i don't know, but that was my experience."
probably good as non-gym headphones.
i was looking for a replacement for my gaming earbuds when i stumbled across these.
"they seemed to have good reviews, and i was pleased to discover they actually sounded good."
"they also have a metal jack, splitter and earpieces, but the microphone piece is plastic."
"i discovered they are too heavy to walk around listening to, eventually falling out of my ears even though i have the rubber inserts sized correctly."
this is purely due to the sheer weight of them because they are made out of metal.
"the reason for the 3 star review:i play pubg mobile with them, and have been told the microphone is getting feedback,"
other players at an hear my game.
"i have adjusted volume settings, turned down the master volume, all to no avail."
"i assume it is a poor jack or poor wiring, and that is disappointing."
everything is good about these except when every these are touched while in my ears
or there is any pressure change while they are in my ears
i can here them flex.
it sounds like plastic being flexed.
its annoying and inconvenient.*edit
*
after having worn them all day i've noticed a few more things.*the flexing soundbhas gotten worse.*the wires are very stiff and thick*the external body has a texture to it like fish scales.
it is very rough and runs part of my ears and hurts.
i will be sending these back.
yes the sound is good and mic clear
but this is not worth all the other things wrong.
nice headphones
but they're kind of big and heavy.
the cord is notably heavy and weighs the headphones down and out of my ear easily.
the design also generates a lot of wind noise when biking or if it's quite windy.
"not quite perfect anytime headphones, but they'd work well for traveling."
also the plug area is metal and only has a very small amount of soft material to cushion falls.
it's helpful to have a plug end that isn't made of metal and is more cushion-y.
my ipad pro had a red screen of death after a small fall on its headphones port with some sony headphones.
"pros: they came really quick, ordered on sunday, arrived on monday, the cord itself is pretty long, so my advice would be to tuck into your shirt if that bothers you."
cons: delivery.
what is the point of adding 'special instructions' for the delivery driver if they are still just going to leave the item at the door.
had to call my office manager to put the package inside my patio so no one would take it.
"and lastly, i honestly wanted to return them because i love music with heavy bass, but didn't wanna spend an arm and a leg for something i'd honestly break in a couple months."
so i read the reviews an decided on these.
"i tested out the quality on my afternoon walks with my dog, and was not impressed, thought if i changed out the ear pieces the quality would get better, but with the ones they provided i was sadly mistaken."
but when i used the ones from my old headphones i could noticeably tell the difference.
so in my opinion they are okay.
"if you are a lover of bass, but dont wanna spent too much money i'd say get these, but would strongly recommend using different ear pieces that do not come with these."
i would have to say the best thing about these buds is the longer than standard length cord.  
"i use them at work when listening to youtube, podcasts etc while they are plugged into my laptop pc.  "
the extra length gives me freedom of movement that my previous set lacked.  
the sound is adequate and at a good price.  
lets face it
there are hundreds if not thousands of choices when it comes to earbuds priced under $10.
i can honestly recommend these to the casual user.
i wanted to wait a couple days of testing before i could review.
this is definitely worth the money.
i usually get cheap earphones
so i'm impressed.
"i've jumped a few times from people walking up to me with these on, because i couldn't hear them coming."
the only downside is the mic on the earphones.
i have to hold it up to my face or keep it close to my chest for anyone to hear me when i'm talking on my phone.
they can hear me but it sounds far or muffled but everything works as it's supposed to
and i plan on buying more after this.
just waiting to see how long it lasts.
i almost lost them yesterday and got sad lol.
the right side stopped working 3 days upon purchase.
it then stopped working altogether three weeks later.
the bass is okay
but at the expense of the treble.
"it sounds muffled and ""stuffy""."
the sound is not all that crisp and clear but what bothered me the most is that the sound goes on and off at the slightest movement of your head and often accompanied by a static like noise.
very disappointed.
i didn't even use these at the gym.
just for walking around
and it took less than a month for it to break!i
should've known better...
it's sony extra bass headphones for me.
"sale price 29.99, regular price 49.99 & worth every penny and then some."
these?
meh.
i bought these as a cheap solution for a wfh position that required jack ready headphones.
"i assumed i would use these for a few weeks until i was paid and could replace them, i could not be more wrong."
i honestly love these things.
"i was shocked to find out the casings are metal and not plastic, the cords feel thick and rubbery, not brittle plastic like many options at the same price point."
the sound is fantastic and definitely better than any earbuds i have used in this range.
the mic is actually at a reasonable distance from my mouth when i'm wearing these.
"too many pair have the mic much too low, not the case here."
"i have used these over the past 2 weeks with my phone, work computer, and switch all with great success."
they also don't hurt to wear for multiple hours at a time.
"add in the cute carrying bag, extra pad sets, and limited warranty and you really can't go wrong for $10."
the sound goes in and out.
you have to twist the jack until there's sound in both earbuds.
"i wasn't sure what to expect from these, but i am really pleasantly surprised.  "
i needed something that fit my budget to allow me to focus on computer tasks with my children in the house.
these are doing an excellent job at just that.
"noise cancelation isn't perfect, but it sure is darn close."
the sound quality is pretty great as well.
you can't go wrong with these at this price.
audio quality seems good for the price.
"the build is sturdy, from the 3.5mm jack to the point it branches into two ears."
my earphone was delivered with the right ear inoperable.
very disappointing since the sound quality isnt bad.
"cannot believe these were only $10!i’ve got to say, i was sceptical when i noticed the price"
"but they still prove to be leaps and bounds past other budget headphones in sound quality(bass,treble and mid), aesthetics and structure."
"you get a little synthetic bag, 3 sets of rubber ear things which are probably great"
i dunno
i haven't touched them.
oh you also get a warranty thing and 'instructions'.
"the one year warranty , which is really handy in case anything does break or go wrong."
these are well worth the money!
sometimes you don't need bluetooth ear buds.
"and when those time arrive, you want a good pair of wired ear buds for the task at hand."
the  adorer em10 have great base and streaming music/video is excellent.
the manufacturing process for the adorer em10's is great.
it feels and sounds like high end material was used to produce them.
i'd highly recommend them.
these ear buds are ok for the price
but they have an echo when you first call out or someone calls you.
"it usually lasts about 5 to 10 minutes and then stops, not sure why."
"it does it every time,  "
i thought it was maybe my reception
but i use them every day and it still does it.  
but they are good for listening to music on my walks.
"at first, i wanted to use these as a backup pair of earbuds, but i now i think that i want to use these as my daily earbuds."
"they are very comfortable to wear and even more, they sound amazing."
the bass is way better than i was expecting and these earbuds handle mids to highs fairly well.
i think that these are a great overall product!
i am amazed at the quality for the cost.
the quality is above and beyond what i expected.
they are durable.
great sound.
"volume control, mic, and pause"
"/answer hang up and a, m and large earpieces to select from"
included with a small carrying pouch to boot.  
sweet.
"i purchased these headphones, but i ended up sending them back."
"the volume was great, but there wasn’t a whole lot of bass and they had a tinny sound."
the noise canceling only worked if you put them really deep into your ears.
they just didn’t work for me.
"quality wise, they were well made."
i am disappointed that they didn’t work out.
every time the cord moves it transmits a thumping sound that is very annoying.
"it also has no clip, so it's impossible to prevent the cord from flopping around."
the cord is heavy and rubber coated
and i think that's the problem.
"sound quality is very good for the price,  but these are just not good for exercise."
i can't believe that nobody else mentioned this.
"after about a month of use, the part of audio that is voice started disappearing, or becoming muffled."
"also, now i pay attention to the shape of in-ear part."
"for me at least, too much shuved in ears very tightly, and after wearing for long time, caused ear ache."
after this one i bought the kind that is more flat.
these i threw out.
i like everything about this earphones.
the sound quality is very decent at low and higher end.
volume control is precise.
the phone's physical make-up is pretty solid.
the only thing it doesn't do as it supposed to was searching for previous songs.
i had to press 4 times for it to go back to the previous song.
i would definitely buy this earphones again.
absolutely love these earphones!  
"if you read the directions and insert them into your ear as directed, you will receive a much more comfortable fit.  "
i have small ear canals and tried to insert them without reading first and the fit wasn't comfortable
but i thought it was something i had to deal with!  
the sound is incredible.  
the bass is amazing!
i would compare the sound quality just as good as home theatre sound.  
they aptly warn you to turn down the volume before on your device before putting the earphones in
and you should do just that!!
totally recommend them!!
love these earphones.
they sit comfortably without sticking out like some earphones out there.
it came with 3 pairs of spare earbuds.
the sounds quality is excellent with deep bass and very clear mid and high tones.
even at high volumes the sound quality does not distort or change.
the quality almost matches more expensive earphones like sennheiser.
build quality is very good with 3.5mm jack.
"provide 12 months warranty and 30 days money back guarantee, don't worry about it being damaged."
definitely recommend trying this out.
i think it is the best you can get for the price.
these headphones would get a higher review if the left earbud died within a week of purchase.
"also i noticed that after the earbud went out, the headphones would pause the music randomly and cause google assistant to freak out so yea"
i work from home with 2 dogs and 2 kids.
these headphones have great clarity and i can hear my work without being distracted.
they fit well and are very good quality.
they came with extra tips also which is nich because my kids like to take them off and lose them
"very portable, great sound"
if you insert them properly - bass
"is fantastic, noise cancellation is somewhat average, volume control easy to manage.  "
"one suggestion i've got is a better, more solid carrying case.  "
the cute little pouch is a tight fit for the earbuds +
extra tips for storage.  
"overall i'm very pleased, having gotten great bang for my buck."
"these earbuds are a great value for their price, the sound is good, and they look cool, and they are very usable for gaming and online interaction."
"my only problem was that the sound buttons malfunction when they are plugged into a computer, other than that, they are a great product, i would definitely recommend."
"given the price for these, my travel, earphones, hard to beat the quality of the sound."
wish that the ear cushions were of better quality
but that is the usual with this price range of earphones.
great offering!
i'm not sure what else a person would want from a pair of earphones under $50.  
they are well made.
they have a carrying bag.
make of metal.  
high quality sound.
4 different sizes of rubber ear pieces.
i agree you can yank them out easily from running because the stick out from ears some and pulling down pulls them out.  
i guess if i wanted bose in
ear i would have paid the $75 bucks
but they get wet
", they get stepped on, they get lost, just like these do.  "
i'm very happy with mu purchase.

i'm very happy with mu purchase.
it feels like good quality
but i was disappointed to find that there is a low wispy static sound in the background at all times.
very noticeable at higher volumes.
the buttons are firm and make a click noise when used which is kind of nice.
this is the best earphone i have bought so far in just $9.09.
it has every which i need boom bass with trouble sound and microphone.
"the build quality is no-1, did not expected this good quality earphone in low price."
"all in one package, guys don’t think to much just go for it."
only one suggestion if you feel not getting the sound which you expected just change the earbud (those extra rubber ear buds.
that come with it.)
"advertised as ""powerful bass"" but that bass is almost non existant."
don't do what i did and trust the reviews on here.
these $10 (as of 11/19) earbuds rival past headsets and earbuds!
"the bass is unreal, these little buds kick!"
i've listened to everything from black sabbath to metallica to vivaldi to bass boosted remixes and these things don't flinch!
"grab a couple for backup or a friend, you will not regret it!"
remote broke within a week.
keeps acting like i'm pressing/holding the call button.
update:
got a return and the same thing
+ the area of the cord closest to the jack broke within not even a month.
these tend to echo so when using them for a call they are not great but for music listening they work well.
i would not buy them again as i use for calls and have other for music.
i do not recommend these.
these are so good headphones.
the bass is good and the microphone is quality.
i really liked the sound and the fix.
nice little carring bag to keep the wires good.
they seem study and canhandle a good work out!
price is super!
nice earphones.  
solid.  
good sound.  
good connectivity.  
i like that the cable is strong and will not fail like many other similarly priced headphones.  
i sleep with these at night while listening to old time radio.  
many i have purchased in the past (not from the same manufacturer)
and they have failed due to my crushing weight while turning after sleeping.  
not these.  
get these; you will be glad you did.
i wasn't expecting much for the price but have honestly been surprised and impressed with the amount of quality for the money here.
i'll admit i'm no audiophile but for general music as well as
conference calls these work great.
will consider a 2nd pair as backup for my other bag.
these are much less annoying than whatever headset you got with your phone.  
i admit they are slightly old fashioned (like me)works and sounds good.  
a good replacement for your phone calls and music.
"very well made, solid pair of ear buds."
"not at all like the light, flimsy"
ear buds i’ve had in the past.
they come with three extra sets of ear pieces to get just the right fit.
these earbuds ar great for the price!
they live up to their standards with there deep bass and are good a noise cancelling.
the earbuds are really comfortable in the ear and can be adjust to your liking what i like a lot.
i’ve been using for a few days now and haven’t noticed any faults yet or problems.
they feel like they are made out of strong and durable materials what i wasn’t expecting for the price.
they are a lot better than a lot of the earbuds that i’ve had over years what cost even more than these!
i needed a cheap pair of ear buds with a mic since the ones that came with my phone had the speakers on one side stop working.
"i saw these, and i was like ""eh, these look good for $10.""i have to say i am extremely pleased with these."
"the noise cancellation isn't perfect, but it's pretty impressive considering they're ear buds."
"the sound quality is very good, they can get loud, and the build quality seems nice, as well."
these feel like they're worth double what i paid for them honestly.
"great product, so much better than the stock ones received with my iphone 11.  "
stay firmly in ears during walking/gym.
sound quality is excellent.
would highly recommend these.
surprised that this tiny earphone can blast powerful bass.
noise cancelling is also great.
i was looking for a backup cheap earphone for my commute but this has become my #1 daily driver all around.
great earphones for the price.
"if you’re looking for a great earphone that cancels out the noise from the outside yet puts the bass for those great workouts, look no further!"
for just ten dollars it's the best quality for the buck.
i'm very impressed.
the wire is thicker than what you see with other earbuds with a feeling of strength.
the sound quality is incredible.
it comes with an assortment of earbud sizes to switch out if needed and a really cool bag to store them in.
i was going to spend $30 on a pair from a department store but
so so glad i took the chance on these instead.
thanks adorer.
i'm really happy with these ear buds!
bought them for my son for a gift
and i think they fit just perfectly!
packaging was great and shipping was fast as usual.
"nice looking headphones, sound is great, bass is smooth can’t compete for the price honestly."
had mine a month
and i have them pretty loud at times
so surprised they’re still working perfectly.
the sound quality is good and i like the controls but
the problem is that they hurt to wear.
the rough heavy metal pieces press against the outside of my ear no matter what angle i try to put them in.
"the thin, soft covers only cover the end of the metal pieces that go into my ears and do nothing to cushion the bigger outside part."
these are easy to use earphones.
the sound quality is good.
the ear buds fit in the ears pretty well.
the overall quality of these ear buds is acceptable.
good little pair of headphones.
nice sound to it.
not too much bass.
wired good looks strong.
o have it plugged into an iphone lightning converter.
these earbuds are quite comfortable and give a good range of sound.
i even use em as ear plugs when trying to sleep.
good for passive listening.
"great hefty headphones, they look pretty well-made."
"as for sound quality, it's pretty good!"
"i use it to listen to music and during meetings, sound is clear and the noise-cancelling helps a lot."
"this is going to be my everyday headphones and for the price, i will probably get two for the home and the office!"
loving it!
well made.
feels durable.
"the cords, ear buds, and volume control feels like it could take some misuse and endure light abuse."
for the price it is worth it.
"the sound quality is not great, just average, in my opinion."
ok i look the lil bag that these headphones came with no longer tangled in my purse or work bag.
they are very heavy and good quality headphones
i have not had any issues with these
great for the price.
"sound quality is good, comfort is pretty good, and the controls work with my phone."
"no complaints, especially for the price."
"solid, cheap pair of headphones."
i was surprised at how much better these fit than the regular apple plastic headphones.
it includes 3 ear piece sizes and fit perfectly.
great headphones for the music on my phone.
"sound is good, nice little bag, and extra rubber pads."
for the price they are hard to beat.
very good sound quality.  
easy to use since they don't tangle easily like many other buds.  
one mini complaint:  
the package of in-ear fittings included a large and 2 mediums the same size.  
no small for my ear canals.
i bought these because they had a microphone i could use for talking and would fit more comfortably in my ear (i don't like the iphone ones).  
they work great for that purpose!
seem sturdier than other ear buds i've used in the past.
have to push into the ears to keep from falling out.
but they do the job.
i bought these as a replacement for the earphones that came with my phone and they are well worth the price.
"despite being a relatively cheap earphone, it feels comfortable to use and the sound quality doesn't disappoint."
"although i found the treble to be higher than what i'm used to, the sound quality is excellent and the base is good."
it comes with three extra buds in different sizes as well as a pouch.
i couldn't be more satisfied with the purchase.
i expected these to be garbage like most - nope!
these are great.
i'm really picky with my headphones
and i will get again.
good headphones .
only returned because i got the note 10 plus after my note 9 crashed
so couldn't use as no headphone jack
i use these earphones in an office with a lot of background talking and echoing.
these cut all the background noise and provided crisp intelligible sound.
i use these on my computer for all phone calls and video calls.
the range of highs and lows is fantastic.
very responsive microphone also.
they fit my ears perfectly too.  
i've tried other brands but none can match the performance and fit that these offer.
wires covered in material that prevents tangles.
length is perfect for using on my laptop allowing me to sit comfortably to view my monitors.
great sound.
wires covered in material that prevents tangles.
length is perfect for using on my laptop allowing me to sit comfortably to view my monitors.
great sound.
the sound quality is amazing.
works very well at low or high volume.
comfortable and easy to carry on the go.
so far so good.
decent for the price for sure.
i like that you can double click the play button to skip a song.
allows me to keep my phone in my pocket all day at work
my dad loves this earphones.
he likes the quality sound and volune controller.
they're comfortable to wear.
"another great pair of earbuds, sound and clarity are good, bass is clear, no noise gets through at all, great product"
the sound quality was alright
but the microphone a sound adjustment buttons don’t work at all
and i mainly bought these for that feature
"clean sound, fits perfectly in ear."
great/strong material.
i loved it's design.
finally i can replace my headphones.
these are the best wired headphones i have had in a very long time.
the sound quality is great.
"they are pretty durable, they have been snagged a few times while i was using them at work and there have been no issues."
the noise cancelling is good unless someone is actively standing next to you shouting in your ear.
overall great headphones.
everything in the description is spot on.
it has amazing bass and it does isolate noise.
it also comes with a carrying case which most cheap earbuds don't have.
i really like the comfort on these earbuds too.
overall these are great
i would recommend to anyone who is looking for something that doesn't break the bank.
i will be purchasing more in the future!
the sound on the headphones matches that of headphones that cost five times as much.
the small remote has all the functionality of volume up/down/pause-play.
the cord is long enough to put in the back pocket which is a huge advantage.
the headphones come with different size earpieces
and so it's easily adjustable to any ear.
recommended!
"sound not all that great but for the price, it’s ok.. worked for what i needed them for."
everything about these earphones exceeded my expectation.  
very durable and affordable.
bought these for my 10 year old who is really hard on headphones.
he says they are the best pair he has ever had
and they came with extra ear pieces so if he loses one he will have an extra.
purchased for my son for school.
the little pouch is great to keep them in for when he's not using them in class.
"good sound and great for the price, but fall out of my ears.  "
mic works well too.
they don’t slip out of your ear and the sound is good.
good deal for the money!
i got these for work calls through computer apps and so far they have been great.
the noise cancelling helps me hear the conversation much better and others have commented that my call is crisp and
i’m easy to hear.
the different size ear
bud cushions are great.
no complaints so far and great deal for the price!
"these are the worst, cannot hear full range of audio recording."
the free headphones from the airlines are better than these small bug ear phones.
"hate it, waste of money, totally disappointed."
the sound quality is good.
the earbuds don't stay in my ear very well.
good bang for you buck decent sound quality and noise cancellation for the money i would recommend this product
very good sound.bass.quality.
decent price..
wish shipping was cheaper..
other than that 👍
"poor sound quality, very little bass."
i just wasted my money.
"worked fine for watching a laptop movie, didn't notice any noise cancellation."
i've bought 3 in the last 2 months because they are so good.
great quality set of headphone.
sound is crystal clear.  
tangle free and durable.
these headphones are great at cancelling surrounding noise and delivering good bass and sound.
"my only problem atm is that the cord stays all curled up from the twist ties, but i'm sure it'll flatten out with use."
the buttons are sturdy and require a good push to use so don't have to worry about accidentally pausing or hanging up or anything!
really nice earbuds.
sound quality is clear and clean.
these are some great ear buds.  
i real enjoyed them.
excellent earbuds especially for the price of them.
"only works on one side, and volume control doesn't seem to work."
seem pretty solid otherwise.
i'd recommend as long as you don't mind sending them back to get new ones.
can't review any other parts of it.
"i don't care enough to send mine back, and i only need one side anyway for my casual use."
i like the headphones.
"they are loud and the sound us very clear, when listening to music or speaking to someone.  "
"i didn't expect much from these headphones considering the price, but they work great."
i would purchase again.
a long wire and really heavy duty body.
freat product.
"good sound quality, mic quality is pretty good."
sound is okay.
the mic sound is muffled unless the mic is held close to the face.
"the smallest eartip provided is still too large, making it painful to wear."
i got the item and work okay for the first night of using it.
then next day i went to work and right earphone doesn't work.  
really this is
products martial feels cheap and clearly it functions like it.
"noise cancellation is average, just another marketing buzz work thrown on the title."
what a bargain.
"they sound good and i love the volume control because in addition to being able to control the volume there is also a center button that allows you to answer calls, skip to the next song during playback, and pause the current song."
these earphones are everything i'd hoped they'd be and more.
these headphones fit and work great.
looks good.
light weight.
good quality.
not what i expected.
not a very snug fit.
sound is ok.
the volume controls dont work with my particular mp3 player.
give me a headache.
don't buy.
garbage
these are nice ear buds for the price.
"they feel sturdy, dont fall out my ears and sound nice."
"i love these earbuds, i felt the quality of this earbuds, because i am always playing pubg, and i heard the sound exactly where the step was unlike the other one that i got."
and my skills got better with it.
love it.
glad i purchased two instead one.
"after 5 days using, earbuds hurt my ear"
"if you want to buy it for using microphone, i don't recommend."
people said i mumbled although i was talking normally over the phone.
sound quality is great though.
wonderful earphones.  
great sounding.
these do not fit well.  
they hurt my ears and keep falling out.  
"the sound quality is pretty poor, but i have been told that people can hear me clearly."
amazing sound.
best earphones ive ever had.
highly recommend.
"sound is great, especially the bass.  "
"even with the extra ear sizes that come with it, the plug itself is almost too large for my ears and cause some discomfort."
i cannot believe how this product has more than 4 stars.
the audio fades in and out until you twist the jack into the correct position.
"i don't know if this is just a defective piece i received, but surely not what i expected it to be."
"awesome product, great sound for the price."
everything you can imagine is good with this headphones
except- volume buttons not working on mac book
pro-
"in your ear, headphones itself creates sudden loud noises in your ear; when you accidentally hit the headphones or the wire."
i think this is because of the metal structure.
sound is very good along with the bass.
as for comfort they feel really good in your ear and sometimes i forget they're even there.
"my only issue is that they unplug very easily,this good just be circumstantial."
overall a good pair of headphones for the price.
they are nice and sturdy earbuds with good sound quality.
"the mic on them is good too, people can hear me well through it."
these earbuds themselves are solidly built.
no one piece of their construction looking weaker than another.
listen to music and conversation
item as described.
thanks
great.
has nice bass and clarity
very good...
the price is phenomenal!!
love this product and this price is even better.
quality of sound is perfect.
and the carry porch is a bonus.
my daughter liked them better
"don't buy, i plugged these things into my phone and all i could hear was a weird loud noise."
recently was looking for a replacement for my apple buds.
i chose these based on price and ratings.
i am very pleased with my purchase.
the sound is great.
the volume and mic control works great with my phone and the quality of the earbuds
feels solid.
i would purchase again.
"i liked everything about this earbud/mic set, all for such a great price"
i like them pretty good very comfortable with loud and great bass sound
☺️
"i was searching for a temporary pair to replace my old earbuds, but  these are just so great!"
the features are awesome and if you're a student then these are great at cancelling out noises!
i highly recommend purchasing these.
'just right.
these buds are too big to fit in my ears.
i don't recommend them for women.
"the sound quality of these isn't the /worst/, but i specifically got these because of how they have a mic."
"however, whenever i tried to use the mic, i got blasted with terrible feedback and echo, muffled sound quality."
wow such a great headphones.. very loud and had alot of bass.
edited:
honestly this headphones have disappointed me.
doesn't work properly anymore on my phone.
i hear static and the bass sound distant when i'm listening to music.
the earbuds were a reasonable size without the hard platic part being too clucky.
the cord is thin which personally i like.
the sound is comparable to bulkier options.
there's usually a tradeoff
so this is a nice sweet spot.
great value for the price music sounds great with plenty of bass.voices on videos are crystal clear with very little outside noise
amount of bass is very sensitive to how far inside ears the earbuds are placed.
often it is a delicated balance between too much and too little bass.
good overall.
well made.
volume control and mic work
well.
best headphones i could ask for and a great price!
has amazing bass and different plug sizes for your ear!
i love them!
definitely recommend!
it has been a month now.
excellent performance.
got 2 of them.
"great noise cancellation, superb comfort and ease of use."
"comes with a microphone, and volume buttons."
also comes with extra caps and a travel bag.
would definitely buy again!
"this product is so good the first time,"
that when i lost it during a vacation trip.  
"i re-ordered it again, out of pure satisfaction for the quality and easy use of this earphone.  "
i highly recommend due to its price and reliability of everyday use!
so far they work and sound great.
i'm really hard on earphones so hopefully these will last.
i really like my adorer earphones!
"they are very comfortable, have a great sound"
and they come with a travel pouch and 3 pairs of tips in different sizes
so you can find the ones that best fit your ears.
great deal for the money!
"ẽtremely great noise cancellation but at one point one earbud played lower than the other, wiring was kinda faulty"
but earbuds look awesome and perform with perfection!
bass could be a little bit deeper
"received it and tested it for couple of hours, product looks dependable with good sound quality and finish."
design is sleek and wire quality to stay.  
recommend purchase to others who need something for regular and rugged use.
"i like the sound quality of these headphones, even can with a little bag to store your headphone in."
they were inexspensive and great quality.
i use then on my samsung galaxy s9 .
they work great going to by my teenager one for her ipad.
first off i like to start by saying those earbuds  look great
they had amazing sound quality
and they feel like very premium product they come very well packaged and neat
i’ve had those for a week now
and i’ve been enjoying it since
really well done.
great price!
"they hurt a bit after a while, but they are of good quality overall"
i am so upset.
"after getting this for my boyfriend for his birthday, the microphone stopped working after 2 weeks."
will not be buying again..
my daughter loves them!
very decent sound quality.  
fit is great.  
price is very reasonable.  
unable to comment on the noise cancellation claim at this time.
"overall, a very fine set of ear buds."
both pairs i recieved the speakers blew within a week.
the product is really great!
quality of the sound is good and also the noise cancelling effect.it comes in a box with
everything you might need.i highly recommend this headphones!!
"i am very satisfied of quality sound ,love them, i can listen music while i work out, and listen for my audio books."
highly recommend!!!
i'm amazed at how good these headphones work.
the sound quality is really good and it cancels out all the outside noise.
i am stunned at how good of quality they are for the price!
i will be buying more!
"these work great as far as sound quality, but don't expext them to actually be noise cancelling.  "
they don't really do that at all.
"great sound quality, and pretty good noise cancellation."
good value.
only problem i had was the volume control
- i could only lower the volume.
"overall, happy with my purchase."
"great sound quality, and pretty good noise cancellation."
good value.
only problem i had was the volume control
- i could only lower the volume.
"overall, happy with my purchase."
the product was great and works great.
it arrived a day before the scheduled delivery date.
overall good earphones for the price below $20.
"they appear very durable, and the finishing is good!"
serve the purpose for which i bought them - listening to podcasts while taking walks!
nice earphones for the price
"i just received these in the mail and was impressed by the noise cancelling effectiveness, and the quality of sound that it delivers."
for the price you can't beat it!
those were not noise cancelling....
work great
the earphones were nice for a cheap price.
i like how they contained extra earbuds of different sizes and a tiny bag to put your earphones.
i recommend this anyone who wants earphones!!
nice headphones
i absolutely love it.
nice comfortable headphones.
good sound quality.
i love that it came with a carrying pouch.
i use it with my work laptop
so it makes carrying it around so much easier.
nois insulation is ok but not super good
these work perfectly!
"great sound quality, great noise-isolation and the mic works flawlessly!"
great value for the money and fast shipping!
highly recommend.
todo vien
the sound quality is good.
"but after i insert the earbuds, they fall out of my ear in 2 or 3 minutes."
very frustrating!
the earphones have good bass and for the price they are excellent.
"however, i feel the sound clarity could be improved."
recently purchased these
but i think the pair i have are defective.
they pop in my ear and are just static when used.
"good quality, perfect sound."
"most of all like cable, the best for jogging."
perfect choice for its money
these broke after 2 months.
"while removing from my ear, the pod actually split in half and the wires were exposed/torn."
not long term quality.
"great sound, bass quality is great!"
i love it!!
wife says they're pretty good for her work place.
the noise cancelation helps with the outside distraction of her office.
did not disappoint
i bought these for my 11 year old.
what i like about this product is the great noise cancellation that has.
the sound quality is great.
actually really great earbuds for such a low price.
they are light weight yet feel very durable.
100% worth it.
pretty good so far.  
good all around sound.
bass is noticeable
adorer em10 feature excellent sonic range and surprising low end for great price.
recommended!cl
i loved these headphones but they broke apart within a mere couple months-- shortly after the return date expired :(
i like how it has a strong bass and how it has a noise cancelling and a play back plus control volume button.
highly recommend
i love these headphones great set of headphones for the
meet more than my expectations
good sound for the price.
it has lasted for longer than i expected despite the abuse.
"not most comfy in your ear, however."
good
it is a very good set of headphones for that price.
"actually, it's the best out of all headphones"
i've bought below $20.
"if you want a low-cost headphone with an astonishing quality sound and impressive bass, this one is for you my friend."
great earphones.
makes the music sound nice and clear.
i like the metal details.
it really cancels out the noise
"after using these ear buds for a while, i'm happy with my purchase."
the audio and microphone quality is great.
i listen to music a lot and the bass in the headphones are best .good
quality of the heaphones as well
one of the best earphones for this price.
sound quality is appreciable.
would recommend for sure.
great product and great pricing point!
the sound quality amazing
"they sound great, specially for the price."

"good mic, works well.  "
"quality of sound good, seem sturdy."
"the product is great, nothing to concern."
sound great.  
the price is hard to beat.
these are good quality headphones.
the thicker wire ensures they will last longer.
good sound.
"so far, so good."

my son hasn't torn them up yet.
sound o.k.
hard to keep in ears.
like them
thank you
"i only had it for few days, but so far i love it."
arrived on time and and described.
the sound is great.
"i like how comfortable it is, it works well for my phone and other devices!"
great pair of earbuds.
the fit really good in my ear and offer great sound.
very bad reception for phone use.
great sound for a great price
love the sound quality.
will probably order another set.

absolutely godlike quality.
especially for the price like i'm deadass.
great headphones great price?

works great.
awesome earbuds for the price

️❤️
great headphones for the price.
great quality sound and weight.
i'm ok with them
at least worth double price
love the sound from these.
it is good and cheap 👌👌
really great so far!
personal use
5 stars is still do not know the durability of it.
but they are better than my samsung s9 pair that i lost.
"noise cancelation is amazingly impressive, sound quality is very good and the bass is loud and clean."
not a big fan of loud bass
i'd lower it using my advance volume option on my s9.  
as far as bulid quality goes very nice the stiffness of the material is bendy and thick.
by the build quality i am assuming it will last long.
i would recommend you to buy it.
"if you are looking for great quality earbuds for this price range, you are looking at the right pair."
the cable is noticeably thicker than all other earbuds i've owned which may imply longer lifespan.
"as for the audio quality, as advertised the earbuds are bass forward but not so much that the treble and high tones are diminished."
the sound setting (on your phone) can easily be changed with your phone settings or a third party app.
i'll definitely buy again!
i got these earphones with coupon and only paid $3 and some change.
i was curious how these would sound.
i own quite a lot of earphones ranging between $40~$300.the first impression: i was surprised that it came in a box.
many other cheap earphone products do not come in hard shell packaging as such.
"it came with the pouch, 3 sets of ear tips and the earphones."
i honestly didn't expect it to come with all these extra accessories on $8 product.
build quality
: i think the build quality for this product is pretty awesome.
"the cables are thick, not flimsy."
they are not braided or twist cables but that's expected for its pricing.
"it's got a good weight to it, stays well in my ear."
finishes on the plastic parts such as mic are nice and clean.
the shell of the earphone is made with actual metal.
prints on the earphones are clear and nice.
i own some earphones that are $50
+
but has worse build quality than this earphone.
sound quality
: i think this was the weakest part of this product.
it doesn't sound terrible by no means.
"it just doesn't sound ""great""."
it does what it's made to do.
"but when you consider that the ""panasonic earphones (the best seller on amazon)"" are around $9~$10, i don't see why i would pay the same amount of money for this earphone."
"i'm not sure if any professional sound engineer calibrated this product (it might be a hardware issue, or they didn't have enough funding for calibration)."
"the sound resolution is not very high, feels like the whole sound is muffled."
"hard to explain, it has a very ""stuffy"" sound.  "
isolation between different frequencies is not as clear as i would like it to be.
"mic: i don't use the mic from my earphones, i didn't test them out, but the volume and play/pause button did not work with my cell phone."
"my cellphone is android lg v20, maybe it only works with iphones."
(or my phone is broken)
no big deal for me.
"overall: build quality and packaging is very nice, sound needs some improvement, but for $8 it's not bad."
"if you are looking for a good pair of earphone and don't want it to be built in a plastic shell and cheap cables, this is viable option"
these are excellent wired headphones with great bass and noise isolation features!
the talk feature is an added benefit.
not only can you hear the other person clearly but they can hear you without static or crackling.
the headphones are are very lightweight without feeling cheap.
the look and feel more expensive than the money paid.
i really like the r and l markings
are clearly visible on the end of the buds.
they come with extra buds grips to fit multiple size ears and a carrying pouch.
i would definitely purchase these again and also give them as gifts.
"from cheap earbuds to replace the ones that came with your phone to high-end over-ear headphones, our experts (and our listening panels) have found the best headphones in every category so you can get the best sound for your buck."
we list both wired and wireless options to make sure you can listen to your favorite songs or podcasts in every situation you might want to.
"these headphones feel like they are decent quality, but the cord is so stiff its causes the earpods to fall out of my ear as any jostling while moving or running or working out causes the cord to push the pods out of my ear."
they don't stay in your ear great and the sound quality isn't that great.
seems of very high quality.
the fit and finish are very nice.
comes with a little pouch which is a plus.
"the sound quality is nice, and it fits well in the ear."
the mic picks up voices well.
overall a really nice pair of earphones at a very reasonable price.
recommended.
i don't know how these are only ten bucks.
these have the sound quality of something you would pay $20-30 for.
"these can't be beaten for the price, definitely get these over those skullcandy buds you were looking at."
"for being inexpensive earbuds, they are fantastic!"
"nice sound quality, excellent noise cancellation as well!"
excellent buy!
these headphones are great for the price.
"quite frankly they are heavy, clunky.."
the wire is really stiff.
well built for sure.
lol.
very inexpensive and clear sound quality.
you can definitely notice the difference in the bass of these earbuds versus non-bass boosted earbuds.
the microphone is another great feature.
i do not notice any noise cancellation.
for the price this is a good value pick.
"i wasn't sure based on the price, but they are pretty good."
"nice sound, great fit as well as reasonable."
i will return in a week for an update.
cool headphones like it
i bought this for my daughter for usage at her school.
she was happy to get a new pair of earbuds and
after using it for couple of days at school she was extremely satisfied and was happy that this device is more comfortable then her previous pair.
i was given a discount on this product for a honest review.
i use these earbuds for almost two weeks now
and i like both the sound and the microphone quality.
"design is also great, they made of metal and look very durable."
this is a great buy.
i love how well they were boxed.  
cord is really long compared to other earbuds i've had.  
also comes with several sizes of ear tips so you can get perfect fit
very nice product.
"nice color, nice packaging, clear sound,"
also clear microphone audio.
i returned these the sound quality is not as advertised
fantastic pair of headphones.
the sound quality is great.
very crisp.
they are noise canceling and truly you cannot beat the price.
it is nice that you can skip much from a small control box near the ear bud.
these are some really awesome earbuds.
what i like is they are really small and fit inside your ears and  
they don’t hurt.
the sound has good bass
so the sound quality is excellent.
i do also love the fact that they have a microphone with remote.
great sound quality for a great price.  
be sure and wear the little pieces for the buds that fit you.
you get a better sound with the right fit.
you get several additional pairs.
i didn’t give noise cancellation a five because i do not want noise cancellation.  
i want to be able to hear
what’s going on around me.  
these stay in my ear and that’s a plus.  
they are squishy and fit snugly in my ear.  
these are for android phones not iphones.
"these are great, bought them for my son for school."
i also tried them out.
"very nice comfortable fit, great sound."
i love the feel and the color.
i like the wire is
long enough incase
i have to make any sudden movements.
my son said they're very loud.
great buy.
every year our kids have to have ear buds for school.
i usually buy them from the dollar store and have to replace them though out the school year.
these are great quality and they stay better in the ears.
my son approves!
i liked these small earbuds.
"they are small, but the sound quality is superb."
they fit into the ears perfectly and i do not hear sound from outside.
noise cancellation function is excellent.
the wire is made from good quality material.
i recommend them.
this adorer em10
powerful bass wired headphones exceeded my expectation....
the sound quality is simply superb.
did not expect it to be this good.
completely happy with the purchase.
noise filter is too good and the bass is really awesome.
super impressed with the quality and performance of this adorer em10 powerful bass headphones.
than regular earphones.
i love the fact that there is no left or right.
they fit very comfortably.
they are heavier than regular ones but it does not hinder wearing them.
i think it is because they use a big magnet that produces the great sound.
i love these.
i had to put on new tips that close of into your ear
"but once i did, wow."
the sound came through and these things are great.
"so i’ve tried many different  wireless bt ear buds over the last few years, and been disappointed every time."
"once i embraced “the chord”, i found this product."
"i’m no audiophile, but the sound from these earphones is wow!!"
"can’t go wrong, and the price is right!!"
pull the trigger.....
you’re worth it!!
these earphones fit snugly in the ear.
i did not need to twist or angle them a certain way to get the best fit.
the medium-sized rubber tips fit my ear perfectly.
they are lightweight and comfortable even if you have them on for a long time.
the sound quality is excellent.
"the built-in button for the volume, music, and call controls are very convenient."
what those are so i got this instead.
i'm satisfied with the quality.
"they are well put together, have decent sound quality, and even come in good packaging with multiple different sizes of covers."
"the quality could be better, but they're earbuds."
i won't complain.
"it's pretty good if you can put them in your ears correctly, but i guess you can say that about any earbuds over 15 dollars."
"great headphones that, not only, fit comfortably but also deliver outstanding sound quality."
they are wired so you don’t have to worry about the battery running out or having one fall out and losing it.
the headphones come with different in ear pieces to accommodate any size.
i purchased these for my daughter to use in class.  
she prefers
ear buds over headphones.
she said these fit nice and feel very comfortable.
i like that they have the volume control right on the cord.
"an excellent, sturdy pair of headphones that feel very weighty and expensive."
the additional range of extra buds ensures that they will fit your ears.
they block out excess sound increadibly well and are not overly bassy.
"an additional perk is that the controller on the headphone actually connects to my phone, meaning i can change the music / volume without having to get my phone out."
such a great product for the price.
would buy again.
i just wore these as i mowed the lawn and they worked fantastic.
it was very easy to hear the music and they were very comfortable.
i would recommend these two friends.
i didn’t expect bose sound quality from these especially for what i paid for them
but i was very pleasantly surprised they work very well!
bought these for my baby sister since they were a cheap pair of earphones and they work pretty good for their price point
i bought these as a backup to my name brand headphones
and they've literally become my new favorite.
very pleased
wonderful sound and stays in my ears well.
i actually got for my son and it was too big for his
(he's 5) work well for me!
"well made, non twist cord, feels quality, but most of all, good deep bass."
the bass is a bit overdriven and does
i needed a ear-headset
so i can use it with my laptop or my phone.
"this has a great quality sounds, noise canceling, and comfy."
"these work great with my phone, and tablet."
i like that there are different soft inner ear pieces so that you can use what is most comfortable for you.
they also come with the over the ear pieces that have shape but are very flexible and soft.
my husband couldn't tell i was on earbuds when he called.
"fun metallic blue color, and great sound quality."
these earbuds are awesome.  
they fit very comfortable in the ears.
they have great sound and volume control.
these work awesome!
"loud, good beat tones and fit perfect with optional ear bud sizes."
don't like wireless headphones?
then these are for you!!!
very nice quality for the price.
they've lasted alot longer then most my earbuds.
i bought them cause i needed earbuds
and they were a great price
would
got these for my step father and he loved it
he said they are very comfortable
very very very good quality and very nice noise cancelling system.
"the back design has a curve that looks like a wave, and i got two shades of blue and maybe got another one!"
great sound and good price for school
good quality headphones
so the noise is pretty good.
say they're comfortable and sound good.
so it's a perfect fit.
"i received it today and used it, it is very comfortable and produces great sound quality."
honeslty
i am in love with it.
recommend it to everyone.
pros:• sound quality is surprisingly good
(not great obviously) for budget price
"(although i'm not an audiologist), and has a lot more bass than the lightsky wireless bluetooth earphones previously purchased for over half the price• previous song (- volume button) and next song (+ volume button)"
"ability, unlike the lightsky previously purchased, which only had the ability to skip to the next song•"
call quality is clear with no issues listening and talking to people on the other line• good battery life during high-volume music playback (see test below)•
earphones stayed in and did not fall out of ears during gym workout and cardio• case provided to store earphones and micro-to-usb charging cable•
pairing is quick and phone recognizes earphones right away once powered
on• audio does not intermittently cut out when phone is in pocket
like other reviewers have experienced•
"audibly informs you when powered on, powered off, and low battery• earphones does noise cancellation"
"well if volume is high enough and music has a lot of bass• bluetooth connection stays solid and connected unless out of certain range, unlike other reviewers who have experienced the opposite• range is pretty good, about 50-60 ft as long as there is a clear path opening, although minor obstacles like gym equipments is ok (from my experience)cons:• not ideal for people with small ears, even with the additional 3 variety sizes of earbuds• ear hooks are not adjustable and i found myself occasionally having to re-adjust the hooks so the earbuds stay tightly in ears during gym workouts•"
"playback hours fell on the lower end of the 7-9 hours range (as mentioned in test below) on medium volume, and even worse on high volume• rubber usb charging port cover"
"is flimsy and weak, and prone to being torn completely if not careful• battery died even though phone shows earphones had 30% battery life left, which is a bit deceiving• usb charging cable too short, about 10"" at most• earphones are a bit bulky and do stick outuseful"
info:•
"ran 1 battery test at full volume on iphone 7, playing a 3 hr song, with phone right next to earbuds, and it lasted about 5 hrs"
"45 minutes before it disconnected from the phone• ran 1 battery test at medium volume on iphone 7, playing a 3 hr song with phone right next to earbuds, and it lasted about 7 hrs 22 minutes before it disconnected from the phone• took about 1 hr 44 minutes to fully charge from dead using a 5v power source"
i'm just going to dive right into the pros and cons for this review.
"pros:- comfortable- stays in your ears during even the most strenuous of movements- sound, although not professional quality is better than other headphones in this price range and in many cases on par with headphones that are much more expensive-"
controls are all located on one earbud and not on the cord (this helps tremendously with activities such as running).
buds that have the controller on the cord have the issue of the cord being too heavy causing it buds to pull out of your ear and also make for an annoying bounce of the controller against your neck during high movement activities.
both annoying and uncomfortable.- connectivity is easy and 100% consistent.
never had an issue and range is as advertised at 30+ feet.
you can pair it up with 2 devices simultaneously
and as soon as you turn it on it will connect automatically.- holds a charge for at least 3 or 4 hours.
i haven't actually done an official test
but i can tell you i exercise for close to an hour a day 6 times a week for an average of 5-6 hrs without having to recharge.- cord
"is more of a semi stiff rubber like material that is easy on the skin and less prone to get caught on stuffcons- none that i can really think ofso to sum it all up, these buds are amazing!"
i've tried a ton of different ones and these by far are the cleanest design of the bunch.
easy to operate with little to zero issues.
some suggestions though.
it's best to wear these with the cord dangling in the front of you vs. the back.
if you wear it with the cord behind your neck it will on
occasion stick to your skin when looking left of right as it's not very long.
but this essentially applies to every earbud i've tried in this class.
the other thing is i would recommend only pairing these up with one device at a time despite it's capability of being able to be paired with two devices.
reason being that when you pair two devices they tend to conflict with each other and that tends to cause audio breakup and connection issues.
not always
but it does sometimes
so it's best to just pair it up with one device at a time.
most earbuds that are wireless will either be good for casual listening or good for exercising but never both in the same package.
these earbuds work for both situations easy.
highly recommended!
now all they need to do is come up with a fully wireless version of this same design.
i've already tried some others and all of them malfunctioned or had connection issues within 6 months.
not sure on the longevity of these
but i've been using them for close to 7-8 months now and haven't encountered any problems to date.
okay.
"i am not going to blow smoke up your ass and tell you this headset offers the best audio quality, because it's 20-25$."
"it will probably last around a year, and i'm completely fine with that-"
i recently adopted a golden retriever puppy that chewed up my beats bluetooth headphones.
"not wanting to waste money on an eventual and probable dog chew toy, not to mention how easy it is to lose headphones, i decided to try these."
its true-
the bass is a bit overwhelming and i would rate the comfort as average compared to top brand name headsets.
but the reason i rated it
"5 stars is because for the price, you simply can't beat it."
"if your like me and you constantly lose headphones or break them, this is the best alternative to spending hundreds of dollars replacing brand name items."
i have used them for over a month now for on average 4 hours or more a day and can say they have an excellent battery life.
"connection is easy as well, which i cannot say for competitive products from stores like walgreens"
"(why i decided to buy headphones from walgreens, i know."
not the best decision.)
"i run at least a mile every day and two miles at least twice a week, and have no issues with them falling out or frying because of my own sweat."
"they have been exposed to a small amount of water, in the form of light rain and steam in the shower-"
"yes, i know, don't leave your electronics on the bathroom counter-revolutionary and work fine."
"the reason i was prompted to write this review is because i literally just stepped on one of the earpieces, not like a full on squash"
but a halfway step i realized immediately.
i did not expect them to work but
to my surprise they are completely fine!
i decided immediately to write a five star review.
look.
they are not the best sounding most comfortable headphones on the market-
"the cord, as you can see in my high quality proffesional image, is not reinforced in the middle or weighted to sit down around the back of your neck and kill flap about during a run."
the bass can be obnoxious and drown out some higher tones.
but i don't care!
"the value greatly outweighs the cost as they have proven to be reliable, and most importantly the battery life is on par with higher quality expensive products."
i'd say they last around 5-6 hours on a full charge.
"using them for phone calls works great, the sound quality is absolutely fine, and people can hear what i'm saying."
"again, they are slightly bulky and oversized, and if you have weird ears"
the ear hooks might bother you-
but if your looking for a low cost solution for active wear headphones i reccomend this product as they stay in your ears and seem to be somewhat indestructible.
"eventually i will run them through the laundry, because that's just the kind of person i am, and i am curious as to how they will stand up to that terrifying ordeal, but i have faith that they can overcome the spin cycle of electronic death."
do not take people criticizing the sound quality seriously as you have to be reasonable with expectations regarding a sub 50$ product.
"i bought a mpow h2 headphone that i loved the built, but it had a background noise in bluetooth mode."
i had to return and started to look for another headphone.
"for my surprise, after i returned the defective h2, mpow has contact me and offered to send a new one for another try."
"i immediately accepted, since i liked the quality of the product."
it took some days
and i got a new one.
"i had the chance to experiment now a perfect h2 and i can tell the sound is great and crisp and the eq modes are perfect to adjust for music, movies, games, etc."
"i am feeling comfortable with them, even after several hours and the battery is lasting for 2 hours more than my previous headphone."
also the service from mpow replacing for free my h2 was great.
"so as my wife wanted a new headphones for her fitness, i bought the mpow flame and she is loving to use in the fitness center."
"she says it is comfortable, the sound is great and the battery lasts."
she is happy.
also my son wanted a headphone for his games
and i gave him the mpow 059.
"he said the sound quality is great, clean and rich sound."
i think the build quality is acceptable for this price of headphone and my son said they are adjustable enough to find perfect comfort position for hours of gaming.
i can't be more happy with mpow.
great products and great service.
"alright, these are literally the most durable headphones i have ever seen."
"literally last night, i used these, and this morning i pulled it out of my ears.  "
well!!!
"my mini schnauzer decided to grab ahold of them and chew it up to ""wake me up"".  "
(apparently he had to pee).
"anyway, he totally ripped off the top of the headphone, and actually chewed the plastic around it slightly.  "
i was so disappointed because i've only had these a little over a month
and i love them.  
"well, as it turns out, the music quality is still perfect!"
i simply replaced the top part and now they're good as new!
i can't feel a difference.  
"so if you're looking for headphones that even a dog can't chew up, get this!"
"10/10.i kind of wish i could get a new one because the chew marks don't make it that asthetically pleasing, but"
hey!
music is what matters.
"i use them every single night to listen to michael sealey hypnosis sessions, because i didn't want to use by big, bulky, wooden ones with a small chiropractic pillow."
and the result?!
they're amazing!
they're the best headphones i've ever seen.  
i was actually able to run 2 miles with these still in and my ears sweat like crazy!
it did fall out around the 2.5 mile marker but that's amazing for a headphone considering how much i sweat!
i had a pair of a different model of mpow bluetooth headphones that worked well--until i had them on while getting a haircut.
the left earpiece stopped working after the haircut; i can only guess that the wire must have been internally damaged by the barber.  
that was my mistake; i should have taken them off before sitting down in the barber chair.  
(oops!)  
so i looked for a replacement headset.  
these mpow flame
ear buds seemed worth a try for only about 22 bucks.  
i ordered them
and they arrived timely and in perfect condition.  
it took less than 2 hours to charge them up and they were ready.  
"i found it a bit tricky to learn how to use the controls, but they're not bad once you get the hang of it.  "
"the instruction manual is mostly cryptic pictograms, with very little english.  "
very frustrating and virtually impossible to understand.
might as well use the instruction booklet as a coaster under your coke bottle!
"luckily, i managed to figure out the operation of the headset by myself.  "
"it took a couple of tries to get it to pair with my phone, but once that was done, it has been easy to use since.  "
"the fit in my ears is okay, but the hard plastic tends to make my ears sore after a couple of hours of listening.  "
i wish it were made of a more cushiony material.  
"the range is good, but not great when you go into another room.  "
you may experience minor cut-outs.  
"it may be okay for music, but it can be frustrating if you are listening to an educational lecture and are hanging on every word.  "
"this is a minor inconvenience, but i did not find it a deal killer.  "
the controls are all mounted on the right earpiece.
this is both good and bad.
the good: the controls are convenient and easy to find.  
the bad
": i found it entirely too easy to accidentally push one of the buttons, as there is very little surface by which to adjust the earphone in your ear."
"(there are no controls on the left earpiece, so the left side does not have the same problem.)"
"i have not determined whether the ear hooks really do much to keep the headphones in place, or whether you'd be just as well off without them.  "
time will tell.  
"i also have not used the headset to make calls yet, so"
i can't comment on the call quality.
"(the other mpow headset i had worked fine for calls, however.)  "
"the sound quality for this headset is pretty good, if not ""audiophile"" quality.  "
"(for that, you might want to try some of the ""famous"" brand names--"
but of course those will cost $100 and up.  
you pay for what you get!)  
"one caveat--the bass is a little lacking, but improves significantly when you press gently on the earpieces to form a better seal with your ear canals.  "
perhaps experimenting with the different size ear cushions (included) will improve the bass somewhat.  
"finally, there are no magnets in the earpieces to hold them to each other when they are hanging loosely around your neck.  "
this would be helpful in keeping the headset from falling off when not in use.  
"the bottom line: these are pretty nice headphones for the money, and, despite a few nit-picks, are well worth the money.  "
"if mpow incorporates improvements based on the information in this and other reviews (even if the price has to be raised a bit to cover the cost of the improvements), the next generation could be an awesome value indeed."
edit:  
i tried the largest ear cushions and it made a significant improvement in the bass.  
(also included is a pair of memory foam ear cushions.  
i have not tried those yet.)  
another note:  
"the wire is a little short for when you are using only one of the earphones, and it tends to tug on your ear when you turn your head.  "
this can be annoying.  
"if mpow made the wire 6"" (15 cm) longer it would be great."
stopped working on 11/23/17.  
less than 2 months after purchased.  
seems like when i sweat they quit working.  
supposed to be waterproof.  
guess not sweat proof.  
not happy!!!***update

12/05/2017 - mpow sent me another set.  
they are actually really high quality headphones with very good bass.  
will keep this updated on how they perform and last.
these bluetooth headphones are incredible.
they never failed me once.
i have had them for awhile now and haven't had any issues whatsoever in terms of performance.
they connect every time and connect immediately.
they always auto connect to the device last connected to.
"for example if i turn it on and the bluetooth is on from my ipad, they'd connect to the ipad not the phone automatically unless you go to bluetooth settings and connect it.  "
"i haven't dropped them too many times and haven't ran over them with a car, but generally mpow (i have speakers) are very durable."
the sound quality is very good and the microphone works well too.
"not for improvements: two improvements, but they're little so they won't lose a star.1st, the blinking blue light"
", it has a light on the forward location on one side to indicate it's connected and on"
", i use it to watch shows at night"
and i wear eyeglasses
", well that light reflects right to your eye at night"
so i have a little piece of duck tape on it
"so it wouldn't bother me, the light can be put on the bottom or the side maybe?2nd, the mic could be a little better in picking up voice"
"but i don't think it has any noise reduction, but for the price honestly i wouldn't expect it either."
"so when i'm in the car on the freeway, sometimes i hold the mic to my mouth."
"i wash dishes and get pretty bored, so i got these to use without having to keep my phone on me with regular earbuds."
"they work pretty well, feel comfortable, sound good, and the battery life seems okay despite my imperfect experience."
i'm still not certain if the battery life is very consistent with the advertised 7-9 hours.
"i tend to either listen to podcasts or music and pause for a while on occasion, so i don't have consistent run time measurements."
"i tend to work 4-6 hour shifts, and the battery seems to go out after a few hours (2-3) into a second day after forgetting to charge them."
"charge time is pretty low, about an hour (as advertised)."
"i may not have charged them as carefully as you should to maintain the best battery life (charging before they actually die/leaving them plugged in past 1.5 hours).other than that, they work well, just watch the range on them when you walk away from the device they are paired with."
the signal can be impaired if objects (even your hand) block the distance between headset and device.
"there is a slight delay for button commands (1-3 seconds, depending on signal strength and command type), but that's expected since they are not a direct wired signal."
it has been outright splashed by water (one side falls from hanging at my shirt while at the sink and gets splashed) and it still works.
"the case is nice and keeps them pretty safe, and the extra ear tips(?) are appreciated."
"noise cancelling is decent, but not absolute."
"the sound is pretty clear, but i am not a big audiophile"
so i couldn't make accurate comparisons to anything else.
"the only issue has been my phone not taking button signals (pause, rewind) when the application used for audio is not being used directly, if it isn't the last used app, or if the audio app isn't directly last accessed from the lock screen."
sometimes i have to go back to my phone to re-focus the audio application for commands from the headset to work as a result.
i don't think this is the headset's fault at all.
app and phone programming is likely the issue in those cases.
"overall, it works pretty well, sounds nice, has a decent signal and simple button commands,  and has a decent battery life (still using after almost a year)."
"it is comfortable, pairs to devices easily, has been durable despite storing in a pocket with other things, and it works as intended pretty reliably."
"i definitely recommend at the price they were a year ago and now, about $20."
"good value, good product."
i am not a sound snob but these things blow all other bluetooth headphones/earbuds
i've tried out of the water.
"their sound is fantastic, bass is super rich (if too rich for you, use an equalizer to adjust that), battery life is fantastic, water resistant, controls are simple, connection strong enough, comes with case and tons of other ear bud tips, very comfortable, etc."
i could go on and on but they are just great especially considering they are $15+ bucks which is crazy!i
"have both the iconx (2018) and latest galaxy buds and these mpow earbuds destroy both of them in terms of value, sound, volume, bass, battery, water resistance (though the iconx's were ip67 as well but the galaxy buds are only ipx2), color options, fit, and finally comfort."
i would take these and recommend them over the samsung ones any day.
i really like the galaxy buds for the wireless charging and no cord but their sound and fit/comfort
make them a difficult choice for me.
"plus, the galaxy buds are $130, whereas these are less than $16."
if i break these or something happens to them
i don't worry because they are so cheap to replace.
"as for sound, they are super rich and loud."
"in fact, their max level is too loud for me which is something the samsung buds never got for me."
the sound dampening is really good and the microphone works well for calls
"(my wife says she can hear me just fine).as for connection, its bluetooth 4.1 which i figured the connection would stink but the opposite is true."
i connect these to my note 9 and haven't experienced a single drop or anything.
it does occasionally skip during the song but its a second at most.
the galaxy buds/iconx's will cut out if i turn my head just right or if i press (lightly) on the right place on my phone.
they completely cut off if i push on the right place on my phone; this doesn't happen at all on the mpow earbuds.
these are amazing!
get them especially if really like bass as these have it.
the sound leakage is the one thing i don't like as above 70% volume
the people around you can hear what you are listening to so please be careful when in the office.
noise cancellation:
i was excited to see expanding foam inserts came with them!
"i've purchased more expensive ""noise cancelling"" earbuds that came with only silicone rubber covers that did not perform this function well."
"the foam covers work better than the rubbers for noise cancellation in a heavily noisy environment, but i couldn't tell a difference in a low-moderately noisy setting."
sound quality:
"considering the price and application, i give it a 4."
"these are earbuds, folks"
"- i bought them because they're small, don't get in the way of what i'm doing."
"my brain is also simultaneously occupied by other activities when i'm wearing them, so i'm not fully immersed in the music."
"that said, i'm not expecting miracles to fill my ears."
"the mpows have a good amount of bass to keep your attention, but not so much as to reduce quality to an annoying level during workouts."
if i rated sound quality in a quiet environment and no bodily movement the number would be much different.
for working
out
: they stayed in my ears during weights (free and machine) as well as cardio.
"i don't get super sweaty in the most strenuous of sessions, so i can't tell you how they would work for someone who sweats a lot."
"they're also my new go-to for doing physical things in general (housework, fixing the beater car, etc) because they stay in so well."
battery life:
the longest i've used them for is around 2.5 hours with a couple on-offs over a couple days.
"range: haven't tested this feature, but i can roam my whole 954ft^2 apartment and my whole 1600ft^2 work area with no cutting out."
the mpows are great for my workouts or when i'm doing physical things.
but when i want to (need to... music is my drugs)
experience music
"fully, i wear my wired (made by another, much larger company) over-ear headphones in a relaxing and quiet environment."
i encourage you to find an over-ear midrange headset.
"i see some in my recommended section right now with a 4.5 on 20,000+ reviews for $45."
🤘
pros:• sound quality is surprisingly good
(not great obviously) for budget price
"(although i'm not an audiologist), and has a lot more bass than the lightsky wireless bluetooth earphones previously purchased for over half the price• previous song (- volume button) and next song (+ volume button)"
"ability, unlike the lightsky previously purchased, which only had the ability to skip to the next song•"
call quality is clear with no issues listening and talking to people on the other line• good battery life during high-volume music playback (see test below)•
earphones stayed in and did not fall out of ears during gym workout and cardio• case provided to store earphones and micro-to-usb charging cable•
pairing is quick and phone recognizes earphones right away once powered
on• audio does not intermittently cut out when phone is in pocket
like other reviewers have experienced•
"audibly informs you when powered on, powered off, and low battery• earphones does noise cancellation"
"well if volume is high enough and music has a lot of bass• bluetooth connection stays solid and connected unless out of certain range, unlike other reviewers who have experienced the opposite• range is pretty good, about 50-60 ft as long as there is a clear path opening, although minor obstacles like gym equipments is ok (from my experience)cons:• not ideal for people with small ears, even with the additional 3 variety sizes of earbuds• ear hooks are not adjustable and i found myself occasionally having to re-adjust the hooks so the earbuds stay tightly in ears during gym workouts•"
"playback hours fell on the lower end of the 7-9 hours range (as mentioned in test below) on medium volume, and even worse on high volume• rubber usb charging port cover"
"is flimsy and weak, and prone to being torn completely if not careful• battery died even though phone shows earphones had 30% battery life left, which is a bit deceiving• usb charging cable too short, about 10"" at most• earphones are a bit bulky and do stick outuseful"
info:•
"ran 1 battery test at full volume on iphone 7, playing a 3 hr song, with phone right next to earbuds, and it lasted about 5 hrs"
"45 minutes before it disconnected from the phone• ran 1 battery test at medium volume on iphone 7, playing a 3 hr song with phone right next to earbuds, and it lasted about 7 hrs 22 minutes before it disconnected from the phone• took about 1 hr 44 minutes to fully charge from dead using a 5v power source"
i'm just going to dive right into the pros and cons for this review.
"pros:- comfortable- stays in your ears during even the most strenuous of movements- sound, although not professional quality is better than other headphones in this price range and in many cases on par with headphones that are much more expensive-"

you can pair it up with 2 devices simultaneously
and as soon as you turn it on it will connect automatically.- holds a charge for at least 3 or 4 hours.
i haven't actually done an official test
but i can tell you i exercise for close to an hour a day 6 times a week for an average of 5-6 hrs without having to recharge.- cord
"is more of a semi stiff rubber like material that is easy on the skin and less prone to get caught on stuffcons- none that i can really think ofso to sum it all up, these buds are amazing!"

"the fit in my ears is okay, but the hard plastic tends to make my ears sore after a couple of hours of listening.  "
i wish it were made of a more cushiony material.  
"the range is good, but not great when you go into another room.  "
you may experience minor cut-outs.  
"it may be okay for music, but it can be frustrating if you are listening to an educational lecture and are hanging on every word.  "
"this is a minor inconvenience, but i did not find it a deal killer.  "
the controls are all mounted on the right earpiece.
this is both good and bad.
the good: the controls are convenient and easy to find.  
the bad
": i found it entirely too easy to accidentally push one of the buttons, as there is very little surface by which to adjust the earphone in your ear."
"(there are no controls on the left earpiece, so the left side does not have the same problem.)"
"i have not determined whether the ear hooks really do much to keep the headphones in place, or whether you'd be just as well off without them.  "
time will tell.  
"i also have not used the headset to make calls yet, so"
i can't comment on the call quality.
"(the other mpow headset i had worked fine for calls, however.)  "
"the sound quality for this headset is pretty good, if not ""audiophile"" quality.  "
"(for that, you might want to try some of the ""famous"" brand names--"
but of course those will cost $100 and up.  
you pay for what you get!)  
"one caveat--the bass is a little lacking, but improves significantly when you press gently on the earpieces to form a better seal with your ear canals.  "
perhaps experimenting with the different size ear cushions (included) will improve the bass somewhat.  
"finally, there are no magnets in the earpieces to hold them to each other when they are hanging loosely around your neck.  "
this would be helpful in keeping the headset from falling off when not in use.  
"the bottom line: these are pretty nice headphones for the money, and, despite a few nit-picks, are well worth the money.  "
"if mpow incorporates improvements based on the information in this and other reviews (even if the price has to be raised a bit to cover the cost of the improvements), the next generation could be an awesome value indeed."
edit:  
i tried the largest ear cushions and it made a significant improvement in the bass.  
(also included is a pair of memory foam ear cushions.  
i have not tried those yet.)  
another note:  
"the wire is a little short for when you are using only one of the earphones, and it tends to tug on your ear when you turn your head.  "
this can be annoying.  
"if mpow made the wire 6"" (15 cm) longer it would be great."
stopped working on 11/23/17.  
less than 2 months after purchased.  
seems like when i sweat they quit working.  
supposed to be waterproof.  
guess not sweat proof.  
not happy!!!***update

12/05/2017 - mpow sent me another set.  
they are actually really high quality headphones with very good bass.  
will keep this updated on how they perform and last.
these bluetooth headphones are incredible.
they never failed me once.
i have had them for awhile now and haven't had any issues whatsoever in terms of performance.
they connect every time and connect immediately.
they always auto connect to the device last connected to.
"for example if i turn it on and the bluetooth is on from my ipad, they'd connect to the ipad not the phone automatically unless you go to bluetooth settings and connect it.  "
"i haven't dropped them too many times and haven't ran over them with a car, but generally mpow (i have speakers) are very durable."
the sound quality is very good and the microphone works well too.
"not for improvements: two improvements, but they're little so they won't lose a star.1st, the blinking blue light"
", it has a light on the forward location on one side to indicate it's connected and on"
", i use it to watch shows at night"
and i wear eyeglasses
", well that light reflects right to your eye at night"
so i have a little piece of duck tape on it
"so it wouldn't bother me, the light can be put on the bottom or the side maybe?2nd, the mic could be a little better in picking up voice"
"but i don't think it has any noise reduction, but for the price honestly i wouldn't expect it either."
"so when i'm in the car on the freeway, sometimes i hold the mic to my mouth."
"i wash dishes and get pretty bored, so i got these to use without having to keep my phone on me with regular earbuds."
"they work pretty well, feel comfortable, sound good, and the battery life seems okay despite my imperfect experience."
i'm still not certain if the battery life is very consistent with the advertised 7-9 hours.
"i tend to either listen to podcasts or music and pause for a while on occasion, so i don't have consistent run time measurements."
"i tend to work 4-6 hour shifts, and the battery seems to go out after a few hours (2-3) into a second day after forgetting to charge them."
"charge time is pretty low, about an hour (as advertised)."
"i may not have charged them as carefully as you should to maintain the best battery life (charging before they actually die/leaving them plugged in past 1.5 hours).other than that, they work well, just watch the range on them when you walk away from the device they are paired with."
the signal can be impaired if objects (even your hand) block the distance between headset and device.
"there is a slight delay for button commands (1-3 seconds, depending on signal strength and command type), but that's expected since they are not a direct wired signal."
it has been outright splashed by water (one side falls from hanging at my shirt while at the sink and gets splashed) and it still works.
"the case is nice and keeps them pretty safe, and the extra ear tips(?) are appreciated."
"noise cancelling is decent, but not absolute."
"the sound is pretty clear, but i am not a big audiophile"
so i couldn't make accurate comparisons to anything else.
"the only issue has been my phone not taking button signals (pause, rewind) when the application used for audio is not being used directly, if it isn't the last used app, or if the audio app isn't directly last accessed from the lock screen."
sometimes i have to go back to my phone to re-focus the audio application for commands from the headset to work as a result.
i don't think this is the headset's fault at all.
app and phone programming is likely the issue in those cases.
"overall, it works pretty well, sounds nice, has a decent signal and simple button commands,  and has a decent battery life (still using after almost a year)."
"it is comfortable, pairs to devices easily, has been durable despite storing in a pocket with other things, and it works as intended pretty reliably."
"i definitely recommend at the price they were a year ago and now, about $20."
"good value, good product."
i am not a sound snob but these things blow all other bluetooth headphones/earbuds
i've tried out of the water.
"their sound is fantastic, bass is super rich (if too rich for you, use an equalizer to adjust that), battery life is fantastic, water resistant, controls are simple, connection strong enough, comes with case and tons of other ear bud tips, very comfortable, etc."
i could go on and on but they are just great especially considering they are $15+ bucks which is crazy!i
"have both the iconx (2018) and latest galaxy buds and these mpow earbuds destroy both of them in terms of value, sound, volume, bass, battery, water resistance (though the iconx's were ip67 as well but the galaxy buds are only ipx2), color options, fit, and finally comfort."
i would take these and recommend them over the samsung ones any day.
i really like the galaxy buds for the wireless charging and no cord but their sound and fit/comfort
make them a difficult choice for me.
"plus, the galaxy buds are $130, whereas these are less than $16."
if i break these or something happens to them
i don't worry because they are so cheap to replace.
"as for sound, they are super rich and loud."
"in fact, their max level is too loud for me which is something the samsung buds never got for me."
the sound dampening is really good and the microphone works well for calls
"(my wife says she can hear me just fine).as for connection, its bluetooth 4.1 which i figured the connection would stink but the opposite is true."
i connect these to my note 9 and haven't experienced a single drop or anything.
it does occasionally skip during the song but its a second at most.
the galaxy buds/iconx's will cut out if i turn my head just right or if i press (lightly) on the right place on my phone.
they completely cut off if i push on the right place on my phone; this doesn't happen at all on the mpow earbuds.
these are amazing!
get them especially if really like bass as these have it.
the sound leakage is the one thing i don't like as above 70% volume
the people around you can hear what you are listening to so please be careful when in the office.
noise cancellation:
i was excited to see expanding foam inserts came with them!
"i've purchased more expensive ""noise cancelling"" earbuds that came with only silicone rubber covers that did not perform this function well."
"the foam covers work better than the rubbers for noise cancellation in a heavily noisy environment, but i couldn't tell a difference in a low-moderately noisy setting."
sound quality:
"considering the price and application, i give it a 4."
"these are earbuds, folks"
"- i bought them because they're small, don't get in the way of what i'm doing."
"my brain is also simultaneously occupied by other activities when i'm wearing them, so i'm not fully immersed in the music."
"that said, i'm not expecting miracles to fill my ears."
"the mpows have a good amount of bass to keep your attention, but not so much as to reduce quality to an annoying level during workouts."
if i rated sound quality in a quiet environment and no bodily movement the number would be much different.
for working
out
: they stayed in my ears during weights (free and machine) as well as cardio.
"i don't get super sweaty in the most strenuous of sessions, so i can't tell you how they would work for someone who sweats a lot."
"they're also my new go-to for doing physical things in general (housework, fixing the beater car, etc) because they stay in so well."
battery life:
the longest i've used them for is around 2.5 hours with a couple on-offs over a couple days.
"range: haven't tested this feature, but i can roam my whole 954ft^2 apartment and my whole 1600ft^2 work area with no cutting out."
the mpows are great for my workouts or when i'm doing physical things.
but when i want to (need to... music is my drugs)
experience music
"fully, i wear my wired (made by another, much larger company) over-ear headphones in a relaxing and quiet environment."
i encourage you to find an over-ear midrange headset.
"i see some in my recommended section right now with a 4.5 on 20,000+ reviews for $45."
🤘
"i work outside, year round.  "
"i work with lawn equipment, various power equipment, and in environments where ear protection is recommended.  "
for some reason my phone has to be in absolute direct line of sight for these to work all the time.  
i have a cheaper pair from another manufacturer that will work anywhere up to about 20 feet away.  
my work shirts have a pocket on the left side of my chest and quite frequently the sound will cut in and out.
"i love the way these feel, the noise cancellation from work is amazing.  "
"and when it's working, the sound is superb.  "
it just gets really annoying for my phone to have to be so close and in line of sight of them when my other blue tooth devices are far more forgiving.  
maybe it's just the set i got.  
"if this is a problem that's been fixed, i'd happily try a new pair.  "
"as i said before when it works, it works great."
edit
- so a sales rep reached out to me and sent me another headset.  
the new set seems to stay connected better.  
that alone warrants the upgrade to 5 stars.  
they just earned a customer for life.
so... i'm laughing a lot at this.
"i bought this because of the youtube channel ""unbox therapy"
""" i just wanted to give this thing a try because it was cheap."
i got the headphone in yesterday and then started to pair the headphones to my phone and had a bit of trouble doing so.
i tried everything to try and pair them and was having difficulty doing so.
i was able to pin point that the issue was my phone was being dumb because of the bluetooth security of motorola g5s plus tries to block everything.
"once i rebooted my phone and tried pairing the headphones to the phone, everything worked smoothly."
"i opened up google play and then listened to "" the black panther album by kendrick lamar."
i loved the sound and the noise isolation.
the 5 different was of ear phone adjust-ability was worth it.
the battery lasted me my entire 9-6 work shift without needing to recharge.
"people tried talking to me but since my headphones are noise cancellation, i didn't hear a word they said."
my girl is also sill mad that i had these in
and i didn't here what she was saying lol.
"for the price, i would definitely say go for these head phones."
basically i say these are worth every penny.
"the sound quality is great and they stay in my ears very well, even when i'm eating or laying down."
haven't checked the water fastness yet
but i plan on wearing them into the shower.
the plug seems good enough.
it doesn't pop open on
it's own and the seal seems good.
the mic works reasonably well on phone calls and the sound in my ear for calls is very clear.
"we will see how long the mic lasts, as my last pair exactly like these the mic deteriorated."
noticed it charges up super fast.
but the battery seems to drain faster than my last pair too.
as a reasonable priced product i'm very happy for 20$.
"my last pair lasted well over a year with 2-3 days a week, all day, and shower usage."
so we will see how these stack up.
i'm happy at this point with what iv got.
edit july 2019: still kickin!!!awesome in the shower!
"if i get suds or water down the earhole, i just blow it out and voila!"
good as new.
i dont recommend getting suds down the hole tho as rinsing is required to keep it residue free
and i'm positive that shortens the life of the speaker.
"but, they are truly water/sweat resistant and hold up very well in damp/wet conditions."
:) thank you for reading.
smash the helpful button if u found this info useful!
"as far back as i can remember bluetooth being around, i have hated bluetooth headsets."
"to the last one, every one i have tried has been laggy, and ends up making for horrible, choppy phone calls, even with premium phones."
"my wife conned me into buying a set for her, and one for her cousin in california."
both of them seem to go all godzilla on their wired headsets and kill them in less than a week.
"anyway, these things are tough, and she made the mistake of letting me borrow hers for a day."
"pairing is super easy, operation even easier."
"there is no, and"
i mean zero perceptible lag between these and at first my samsung galaxy s7 edge
", now my samsung galaxy note 9 (bought mine just prior to upgrading my phone)."
"the sound on these is amazing, vocal clarity is top notch, and oddly enough, i have been looking for a way to do a wireless microphone with my phone for video work, and these work awesome for that as well..."
the ear pieces are super comfortable.
"it's not often a product really makes me change my mind so radically about a particular technology, but this headset really does."
well worth it!
"one earbud quit working after 6 months -- they sent me a new headset immediately, free!"
"great job, patazon!i sleep in these every night."
"the battery lasts through the night, and a couple of hours on either side."
i tried other headphones (even advertised as for sleeping!)
that can't pull off this feat.
"(i remove the bud from the ear i'm lying on, for comfort."
"mpow doesn't market these for sleep, so that's no fault of the product.)i swapped in the memory foam ear tips and the sound quality experience instantly tripled!"
also it really blocks out external sound.
comfortable hooks.
reliable buttons.
i bought a second one for my son to take to school for classes that use multimedia.
i think he's the only kid who's not hobbled by a wire!even
the packaging is beautiful.
lovely cardboard box can be repurposed for other gifts.
the zippered storage shell with cargo net compartment is super.
only problem
-- the led flashes a bright blue light in the face of whomever you're looking at.
so i cover it with a tiny strip of electrical tape.
"please, mpow, move the led to the back, or the bottom, or anywhere besides the front."
it makes the wearer look like a borg!
"ok, so i was specifically looking for a headphone for making and receiving calls for my samsung galaxy phone."
i tried  atleast 3-4 headphones and they all failed my expectations but this headphone from mpow is absolutely fantastic.  
"when i talk on my phone using this headphone, there is no disruption or interference of any type."
i can hear clearly from the caller and caller can hear me with no issues.
the voice is so crystal clear.
"now, although i don't listen to my music from my phone using these headphone that much but"
really the sound bass and treble  both are great.
"the call/sound quality is great even with calling from apps like ""whatsapp"" or ""viber"" i am buying another one for my wife right after i finish this review."
"great product, i recommend it."
replacement headphones the company sent me work well.
they charge well and sound great while i workout.
my $120.00 zipbuds died and i needed a replacement pair for runs.
"this pair is just about what you’d expect given the price, if not a tad better."
while the sound of my zipbuds is 10 times better it’s not really fair to compare them given the price disparity.
these headphones are relatively comfortable and have a good volume range.
i also like that they come with a carrying case.
the sound quality is serviceable but not great.
they have decent bass but
the treble and highs are muddy and not very clear.
all in all
they’re fine for a run but not good if you’re an audiophileupdate
": the company mailed me their cheetah headphones after seeing my review which sound way better than the flame ones they sent me, so i am upgrading my review to 5 stars based on the great customer service provided and superior product mailed to me."
highly recommend the company’s cheetah headphones which were $2 more and sound much better.
these headphones offer an amazing value for their price.  
"their sound quality is very good for a budget bluetooth device, with sub-premium sound that easily rivals $15-20 wired equivalents.  "
"the antenna itself is of decent quality, i didn't even notice that i had left my phone in the other room while i showered.  "
"the waterproofing is also quite adequate, having survived an intentional run through the shower and an unintentional day trip in some of the heaviest rain you could imagine.  "
attached is a photo of my shirt from that trip
"-- you can see i was quite soaked, even through my supposedly waterproof coat."
another really cool feature is that you can connect this to two different devices.  
"if you turn off bluetooth on the first device to avoid accidental connection, you can pop it back into pairing mode (by holding down the power button for five seconds while off) and then connecting to a second device.  "
"when you reactivate the bluetooth and pair with the first device, it will maintain connection with both devices.  "
it's pretty schwifty to have it connected to the media on your tablet while still being able to take calls on your phone.
the only real cons are that the +/-
"buttons feel reversed, and that they seem to dislike being shaken.  "
"while running violently or doing jumping jacks you may notice the occasional stagger, but honestly, as long as the phone is relatively close and unobstructed"
i doubt normal users would have any issue.  
it managed to maintain a signal with my tablet through 3 plastic bags and a book bag with very little stutter except while booking it to catch a bus.
bottom line: if you're looking for a great pair of budget wireless earbuds that won't quit because of a little rain or interference these are certainly worth a try.  
"if you're looking for a product with more superb audio fidelity and super rich basses, you're better off buying a more expensive pair of wired headphones"
i can not just wait to post a review about this headphones.
the sound quality is great.
if you’re looking for something like this
and you do not want to pay more money.
i highly recommend this headphone.
i love music a lot.
so this headphones makes me want to play music everyday
these are great headphones for the price especially with the memory foam inserts put in your ear
you really hear the bass that way and cancels out all the other noise
but if you want to hear anybody else you need to use the gel ones
otherwise you only hear the music which is not a bad thing.
great for planes
i use them all the time i waited a long time to write this review because i wanted to give it a good test
and i have not had any thing negative to say about them also like the fact they have the hooks over your ears
so if you're running exercising etc they do not slip off fallout.
and if you're in the doctor's office you going to halfway put one in your ear and have the other one fully in
so when i call your name you can still hear them with the hooks hanging on the edge of your ear lol
i ran with them for the first time yesterday and by the end of the run they where cutting in and out
so bad i couldn't hear the music.
hopefully i just got the one defective set.
not happy about my purchase at all the headset shouldn't be cutting in and out every time i took a step.
update - just received a replacement and ran today with them.
so far so good.
no cutting in and out.
hopefully they stay that way.
great customer service.
sent replacements right away.
being an avid unwilling participant of the get in shape
so you don't die movement
i am at the gym quite a bit.
i've purchased and ruin several types of earbuds over the years.
"they either shorted out from tons of sweat or tears cant be sure, or they completely stop charging."
i came across these babys and my gym experience has drastically changed.
i can workout for hours uninterrupted by a low battery or the massive guy in the corner grunting at the top of his lungs while lifting 200lbs of weight with his neck.  
its
like i'm the only one at the gym.
they seems to do really well with sweat.
the pause button on the side allows you to eavesdrop on super awkward convos between the super hot fit girl and the weird trainer who can take her to the next level if she just texts him.
all in all these are an amazing product.
"sound quality, noise canceling, fast charging and durability cant be matched by other earbuds in this price range."
these are a must buy.
so glad i found these headphones.
they are my new favorite work out accessory right behind my garmin watch.
as others have said the earhooks are a little large for normal to small ears and are not adjustable
but i don't find that to be an issue even when wearing sun glasses.
they came with added bonus of memory foam type ear tips which are absolutely amazing.
i'm going to be upgrading all my headphones.
these have some of the best sounding i've tried even comparing to be-ats brand.
"the price, features, and great sound simply can't be beat for the money."
the best part for me is the insane amazing battery life 7-8hrs on one charge and still going.
they are light and comfortable and have caused no ear fatigue or pain after several straight hours of wear.
they are great for running and cardio
"workouts of all types and stay put even jumping rope, jumping jacks, or burpees.  "
the cord connecting the two buds is light and hardly noticeable not like another similar pair i have that annoy me with the mic constantly flapping around but with these mpow that is not a problem.
have been recommending these to all my friends and if you can get them on a sale even better deal.
i am so mad just by listening to songs with this piece of crap.
the sound quality is
so
so so soooo bad no matter what songs or sound
i listen to.
it doesn't pull out even decent sound for neither high or low pitch.
"i saw many good reviews and that is why i purchased this, but i start wondering if people got this for free to write the review or something."
it sounds worse than the cheapest earphones you can get from earth
(i've gone through many cheap earphones).
it sounds very dull and hazy.
"sometimes, it is actually hard to recognize some words from songs since it was so fuzzy and dull."
i feel bad since my gf got one of this too
and now i have to return two pairs of earphones.
"i repeat, the sound is not bearable."
"the noise block is pretty good, since it has q-tip shaped silicon earbuds."
do not buy it!!
great headphones for the price.
sound great and fit great.
blue led light lets you know when they are charged.
holding down the on button let’s you know when the headphones are connected or turning off.
the headphones also give you an automated warning when the battery is low.
i would definitely purchase these again.

**edited was 3 stars now 5 because they contacted me and sent new headphones!!
great customer service!
all in all love them!original post.
"had since june 04,18 today august 17, 2018 the right side has stopped playing music and has even cracked."
battery life can last maybe 8 hours when listening to music maybe less.
sound quality is really good.
they are comfortable to wear but one ear falls off more then the other.
my husband works out side and sweats a lot so for him
they aren’t sweatproof
he started hearing static most likely from sweat damage
lol.
will be buying again though since he likes them
but i’m rating 3 stars only because they didn’t last as long as i thought they would.
we have 2 kids and money is tight
so i’m praying these next pair will last longer.
love them.
i have never felt comfortable using earbuds.
they always feel as if they are falling out.
"these just loop around my ear firmly, and the smaller sleeves fit perfectly in my ear."
"i use them primarily when i go walking, and after a while, i forget i have them on."
the sound is excellent (for me-
"i am not an audiophile,) and they paired to my iphone easily."
"once i experienced these, i gave my iphone ones away."
i'd used them once.
"for under $20.00, these are a great find."
"now, if you're looking for great gaming headphones or top-of-the-line, rattle-your-bones bass, these are obviously not the thing."
"if you're looking for comfortable, clear sound, reasonable volume, easy-to-pair, stay-on earbuds, these are great."
"i’m not sure what the noise canceling or moisture wicking part of the review means, but the volume itself is much louder than my other headphones."
i do not like the blue light that blinks when you are using them.
"if you are in a dark area it is very bright and although you might not be able to see it, others definitely will be able to see it."
it would be annoying to them.
as it was for me when i was camping the other day.
using my headphones to watch something on my phone.
it was dark in my tent and the blue light was very bright.
i would buy something else if i knew before hand about that.
they pair well to all things and come with a nice carrying case (which also holds the charger).
i purchased these to replace an identical set that i accidentally broke.
"i love these ear buds,  they sound decent for my use (mostly podcasts and streaming radio)"
"they pair and disconnect very easily, the battery life is remarkable and most days they will go for 7-10 hours straight."
they charge up fully in about 1.5 hours.
the case they come with is nice!
"but most importantly, these stay in my ears no matter what i'm doing and"
i can wear them comfortably for 10 hours.
"i have small ears, use the smallest tip, and the hooks that go over the ear are very soft and flexible so they would fit any ear size."
"i have other buds that cost more, and are really inferior to these."
i needed a pair of headphones to connect to my ionic that i could go jogging with.
"these things worked great with the ionic, you can control the volume on the watch or the headphones, they hold on to your ear well."
biggest problem was that they would cut in and out after running/sweating for 10 minutes.
these are definitely not ipx7 rated.
they didn't even last me a week.
it's likely a quality control issue based on the reviews i read here.
"there are other reviewers who have had the same problem, and others who have not."
"the worst part was that i contacted mpow customer support and asked for a replacement, and rather than replacing them they said - ""this headset is sweat-proof."
"if the sweat goes into the headset and makes it malfunction, please dry the sweat with air dryer to try again.""...."
pretty contradictory.
i returned through amazon and purchased another set through another company/brand.
these bluetooth headphones are awesome.  
"they sound great, fit great, look good, and are plenty loud while running or working out in loud environments.  "
there are several different earpiece sizes in case the regular ones don't fit your ear perfectly.  
i've gotten plenty sweaty during intense workouts and have never had an issue with them falling out or moving around in my ears.  
they've got a good sound range and good bass too.  
cancel noise really well.  
"i don't think the battery life is quite 6 hours, and actually i've had problems with them reporting a much higher battery life on my phone than they actually had, but that's not a huge concern to me.  "
"my first pair lasted a little over a year, and i bought another pair about a month ago, which are just as nice as the first.  "
"these headphones are a steal for the price, and i'd highly recommend them."
they sounded really good for the 1 hour they worked.
"i charged them for an hour and a half, like the booklet said to do, and then unplugged them so they would not overcharge."
"woke up the next day and they would not turn on, i even plugged them in and received no sign of life form the led light on the side."
i purchased these in nov 18.
from then to present (jul 19) thinking of them as some cheap backups.
i was shocked at how good they've been.  
i have put these things through all sorts of abuse.
"i've sweated buckets on them, worn them in rain, and caught them on all sorts of grabby items."
they continued to work fine.
let's go down the list of attributes.- sound quality: pretty good.
you can notice the difference between these and cheaper earbuds.
this is probably due to the noise cancelling effect.
the effect is small but noticeable.
people talking nearby aren't as noticeable as when wearing a $10 set of earbuds.
this is especially handy when at the gym as tv's and gym equipment are making all sorts of distracting sounds.
"they don't completely blank everything out but they do a much better job than the ""something stuffed in my ear"" cancelling effect of cheaper earbuds.- durability"
: i treated mine horribly but they kept on working.
somehow i kept managing to hook these are every single thing i ran across.
i was always afraid the cord would get torn out
but it never happened.
they're attached pretty solidly.
while they're water resistant they seemed almost water proof.
getting soaked by rain had no effect on them nor did sweating all over them on gym days.
i would haphazardly scrunch them into a ball and toss into my pocket regularly but saw no issues.
the tangle-proof cord never got any kinks in it.- battery: i've never tested them to the full 7hr life or at least never recorded it.
"however, i made the 4hr houston to corpus christi trip regularly and these things never ran out of juice while playing my audiobooks."
i tended to get a least another hour on or off before putting them on the charger.
i only once got a low battery alert and that was after more than a week of on and off use with no charging.
"in short, the battery life claim seems to check out just fine."
all in all these things are worth every penny i spent on them and more.
they definitely give more expensive brands a serious run for them money.
just received today.
"i assume it came with a charge, but i connected with my usb cord."
"20 mins later, light turned from red to blue."
the next part has always giving me trouble on other bluetooth headphones.
pairing!!
"wow, it took seconds, then i walked away, approximately 20 feet!"
i could still hear the music.
ahhhhhmazing.
"i use this on my pc, which i have a bluetooth dongle plugged into my usb port."
"my other bluetooth headphones are the "" plantronics beats"" which i paid $100!"
"i used them at the gym, hiking etc."
"always worked, getting my bluetooth from my cell phone."
"i decided to try them on my pc, holy dung!!!"
not a good experience!
"i would pair the plantronics after 4-5 attempts, then if i moved a few feet away from the bluetooth dongle, i would lose my signal."
"i thought i would give these mpow flame bluetooth headphones a try, extremely hesitant due to the low price,"
boy
oh boy was i surprised.
perfection!!i couldn't be happier.
"the best part, they are uber comfy, they sound pretty good too."
"buy these, you wont be sorry."
i did some shopping around for a similar set on stores around my area as well as online  and took a chance on these because of the features and low price compared to others.
"i expected them to be just adequate and functional, nothing else."
but i was unexpectedly surprised by the quality you get for the price.
the materials are sturdy and very well fitting.
"i ride a bike, play racquetball, inline skate, and even cut the grass in my yard with this headset on, and it never fails to perform."
they are very nice fitting and the sound is crisp and clear of any distortion.
"the volume allows for high levels so you can crank it to your heart's desire (but not recommended in traffic, though!)."
"also the mic is just as great for phone conversations, nice and clear audio throughout, and as with music great in noise cancellation."
so far i've used it for periods of up to three hours nonstop
so the battery lasts at least that long.
"all in all, is a great accessory for your athletic, work, home, or any activity where you want a private personal sound system."
"great item, great price, and prompt delivery."
two thumbs up!
i got these for less than $30 and they've been awesome.
"easy to set up and use, they don't fall off your ears, they're comfortable, great sound, and the battery lasts forever."
"i've worn these running, working out, mowing the lawn, and even crawling around under the house and never thought once about keeping them on."
"the only complaint i have is that they're not terribly noise dampening, requiring nearly max volume when i'm using the lawnmower, but aside from that, these are great."
"if they ever break, i'll probably buy another pair."
"i bought these for running, as my previous headphones always fell out or got caught in my arms and pulled out."
"i was hoping that these would stay in and so far, they have done just that."
"they have stayed in while running and jumping, and the sound quality stays the same throughout-- no jumpy sounds."
the battery also stays charged for a long time.
i mean this in that it's been over a month
since i last used them and they still worked without needing to be charged.
i had even left it on for an hour cause i forgot to turn it off and even then it still was fine.
the only thing is that i wish the ear bud covers fit better.
"there are three sizes, but none of those sizes really fit well enough."
so i guess that's on my weird ear holes.
also comes with a nifty carrying case with a mesh pocket for the charger cord.
these were very nice looking
and i like that they came with a carry case however
",they don't play very loud at all for my taste"
and i compared them to my applewired  
"ear buds, there is a huge difference.  "
gave to my son just so he would have an extraback up pair for himself.  
update:
customer service took the time to reach out to me concerning my disappointment with the ear buds after my review.
"they sent me out the new updated version of the ear buds and ask me to give them a try, assuring me i wouldn't be disappointed."
"well, i am definitely impressed, not only with how much better the sound was, but, with the excellent customer service."
they went out of their way to make sure i was happy with my purchase
"so i have went from three stars to five, they deserve it."
i definitely am keeping these for myself since they play so much louder than the other pair.
this company is top notch!!!!!!
i use them running and there is no problem st all.
my iphone connects right to the headphones with no problem.
i have smallish ears and most headphones do not stay in my ear.
i can not use the headphones that come with the iphone
so i have been searching for headphones that will fit me
and i have finally found them.
i run in the rain and i sweat a lot and there is no problem i have with them.
the battery life is great
i charge them once every two weeks.
you can not beat the sound quality and durability for the money.
the case that i comes with is great
so i do not loose the headphone.
it comes with multiple different ear attachments that should fit most peoples ears.
i ordered and disposed of a number of bluetooth headphones before finding this one.
it is just what i was looking for.
"i primarily use the headphones when i am working out, specifically when i am running."
"other ones i purchased either didn't stay on correctly, the sound quality was poor, or the controls were so poor that when i went to adjust the volume my phone would start dialing out."
the mpow headphones don't have any of those deficiencies.
the ear hooks work great and hold the headphones firmly in place even when i pick up the pace or run elevation.
i don't have to constantly adjust them during my run and don't worry that they'll fall out.
the controls are easy to use and logically placed.
"it's easy to adjust the volume, pause and restart music, and power the headphones on and off."
i haven't used them yet to answer or talk on my phone.
the sound quality is very good.
"at first i tried to push the earbuds too tightly into my ear and was displeased with the sound quality that resulted, but i found when i pulled them out a bit so that they rested inside the ear, rather than within the ear canal, the sound quality was very good."
battery life is very good as well.
i was able to get through a whole week of workouts before having to recharge.
i purposely ran the batteries down to see if the headphones would give me an audio warning that the battery was getting low.
"it did, but i only had about 10-15 minutes of battery life left at that point"
so wasn't able to get through the rest of my workout after getting the warning.
"there are voice prompts to let you know that you have turned the headphones on, that they are connected to your bluetooth device, and when you turn them off again."
"i find this to be very helpful, particularly since i find it a little difficult to see the power light indicator."
a nice extra that came with the headphones was a carrying case.
most of the other ones i ordered before these didn't come with one.
the carrying case is of pretty good quality and protects the headphones pretty well.
it also stores the charging cable and some additional earbuds of different sizes.
it may be a little thing
"but it is very helpful, particularly since i store the headphones in my gym bag."
i have no problem recommending these headphones.
if you've been looking for the right pair
like i was
i think you may have just found what you've been looking for too.
"i really, really liked these when i first got them - lightweight, good sound quality, great for running."
"then they died after two weeks, so i returned them and ordered another pair, hoping the first was just a fluke."
nope.
"the second pair last five days, for a total of roughly six hours of use.  "
they’ll be going back this week.
update:
the seller [patozon] contacted me after reading this review and sent me a third pair of these headphones at no charge.  
hopefully the third time's a charm.  
i'll update again as i see how they perform.
update part 2:
patozon replaced the second malfunctioning pair that i returned free of charge.  
"so far they are working as one would expect, although in haven't yet put them through many charging cycles.  "
i have raised my rating to three stars from my original one-star review.
update!!!::after
leaving the first review the seller read it and responded in the most professional and unexpected way!  
"again, the sound quality is great!"
i love using them for music and phone conversations.
i also learned the difference between ipx7 (immersion) and ipx8 (submersible).  
thank you for making my shopping experience so pleasant!!at
first....i bought these waterproof headphones specifically for swimming.
i had them for about 2 and a half weeks prior to using them in water.
when i finally went swimming
and i was so excited.
"i went one lap and there was a lot of statistic, by my second lap these headphones died."
no sound whatsoever.  
i gave them two stars because the phone call quality was awesome!!
the ad needs to say water resistant not proof.  
i may just get a pair for phone calls.
"these headphones work ""ok"", they have decent noise cancelling but none of the fittings really fit my ear very well.  "
they fall out a lot and the audio quality is not quite as crisp as say oem iphone headphones.
edit:
the seller obviously cares a lot about customer service - shortly after i wrote a 3 star review on the mpow flame they sent me an email saying they are sending me a different set of new style headphones at no cost.
it was a very pleasant surprise and it did address my fitment issues.
the set that was sent were mpow cheetah’s and it is a better design - wraps around my head gently and actually presses inwards on the ears which is exactly what i needed.
the sound quality also seems better because it actually fits inside my ears and stays there.
noise cancellation is just as good.
if you have fitment issues like me or just want something that will stay on your head/ears while moving around a lot - try to find the mpow cheetah
’s
", it is a better bet."
i've had these for 9 months and they are still working like new!
i wanted some bluetooth headphones when i go running because i got tired of the corded buds getting snagged on things all the time.
i didn't want to fork out hundreds of dollars for beats or bose or whatever.
i just needed something to listen to podcasts or music when i hit the pavement.  
i took a chance with these
and i'm glad i did.
"first, the sound quality is superb."
"granted it's not bose quality, but i'm able to hear lows and highs when i'm supposed to."
"i wouldn't call these noise cancelling, but they do suppress a lot of outside noise."
"i was wearing these while running in downtown portland, or and could hardly hear the traffic (which can be dangerous so don't attempt!)."
i have to turn them down to the lowest volume to enjoy music and be aware of the surroundings.
"second, they fit pretty well."
they're snug in my ears and haven't had any issues of them coming out while running or working out.
the only issue i have is the rubber strap.
it sticks to the back of my neck when i sweat and can get annoying when turning my head because it'll pull one side of the ear bud.
"last, the battery lasts a long, long time."
i run 3-4 times a week for 30-45 minutes and i only charge them once every 3-4 weeks.
"not because the battery dies, but because i just think it's about time to charge them."
i've yet to have them die on me.
"other than the strap issue, i love these headphones."
"i initially ordered these headphones because they seemed to be a reliable enough option within this low price point--i wasnt looking for astounding sound quality; just an over the ear, bluetooth pair of headphones.  "
"these worked well and were exactly what i was looking for, until about a week and a half later when i went to use them after charging them"
and they just never turned on again.  
because i thought it was easier to just order another pair/get them faster
"/assume it was an isolated issue,  i ordered another pair off of amazon from this same seller.  "
the same exact thing happened a week and a half later.
so now i have wasted over $20 on two completely useless pairs of headphones and at this point i am not going to dismiss it and invest in another pair--
"i need the seller to refund me for these 2 headphones, because its clearly not an isolated issue and i can see others here"
have had a similar experience.
i'll just keep this simple.
i have bought tons of earbuds.
a lot.
and i still can't find anything comparable to these when the whole package is considered.
"they come with a protective case, they are extremely durable, the sound quality is good (with solid bass performance), the pairing is easy as heck, and the customer service is very friendly."
"no, i'm not getting paid for this review, i just rarely come across a product that like this much so forgive me if i'm sounding a bit dramatic."
"if there is anything that i'd ask for, it would be to slim down the design a bit, so that the buds don't protrude out of the ear too much, but that's only because of my personal preference, as i want to be able to wear things over my head and ears without these earbuds getting in the way."
"outside of that, this is seriously one of the best things i've ever purchased on amazon, and i'm more than happy to give them more of my money in the future."
thank you! :)
comparing these to the same color scheme beats powerbeats 2 which i had forever but lost.
"for what these are at $22, they work fine"
"and i had no issues charging them, connecting them to iphone x, or getting music playback."
"sound quality is not as good as the beats, but that was not really an expectation due to price difference."
these do sit further off the ear and look a little different in how they sit in your ear than the beats did.
also the hook that goes over and around the ear doesn't feel like it actually does anything.
"again, at $22 these work fine if you want a cheap pair of bluetooth workout headphones without paying for beats."
i will probably order another pair of beats because i prefer the sound quality over this cheaper pair and keep this set as a backup.
editing this as of 17-aug-2018the incredible team from this seller replaced the headphones and they work wonderfully.
they reached out to me the day this was posted
and i had a new pair the following monday morning.
product works well and i have about 20 hours of use out of it with no issues.
:)i received these in march with the intention of wearing these through triathlon training.
"they worked great and sounded amazing for about a month, and started cutting out with about 12 hours of use on them."
"unfortunately, once outside of the return period they failed completely and would work for about an hour at a time until the sweat caused them to short."
with about 30 hours of total use on them (i only wear them when i run)
"they finally died on 16-july; they won't charge, aren't visible by my phone, and won't come back on."
"overall, they sound great and the range is awesome, but they aren't waterproof and without having purchased the 2 year protection plan on them i consider these to be disposable; for a highly rated product i don't genuinely believe a protection plan would be necessary to make it through an entire season, but the robustness of the product is sub par."
"they served their purpose initially but failed way too soon, especially when i have a free pair of headphones from a klm flight that have almost 2000 hours of play time and work great."
these earbuds are basically the generic of beats powerbeats.  
"these might be cheap in comparison, but i had a pair of the second generation powerbeats, and they were cheap garbage just with a higher price tag.  "
my name-brand powerbeats broke after a year
and i had to send them in for repair/replace.  
"then they broke again and there was no more warranty, so the cost to repair them would be same amount i paid for them"
"(i had gotten them on a black friday deal), or the equivalent of buying 4-6 of these mpow flames."
"so how do these compare?- aesthetics: they have same general design, but they definitely don't infringe on any beats patent.  "
"they're a little thicker, and the blinky led is facing front instead of up, so it's more ugly and noticeable.  "
these ones jut out further when looking in the mirror.- sound quality: just as good as the beats.  
they're plenty loud and and the sound is big and enjoyable.  
"this style of earbud just can only go so far, and beats don't have any special magic to make them sound like bigger studio-style headphones.  "
"i can turn them down to a moderate level and listen to a podcast without isolating my self from the sounds around me, and i can crank them up on a run and really feel the music while still being able to kind of hear a car"
coming.-
fit:  
here's where beats do have an edge - these mpows are a bit gangly.  
"for all day comfort when i working at my desk or doing stuff around the house, they move around and get bothersome after a while.  "
"but-- when i go for a run and my movements are even and repetitive, these end up being just as perfect as the beats were.  "
no shifting around and even sound in both ears.- controls:  
also edge to beats here.  
"these don't have an inline control, everything is on your right ear with buttons on the top edge and a button on the side.  "
it takes too long for the power to turn on.  
"it needs like a 3-4 second hold on the button, and if you're wearing them already when you turn them on, pressing the power button"
mashes them uncomfortably into your ear.  
"also if you're in the middle of a workout and you go to skip a song by double-clicking the button, it's going to redial whoever you called last.  "
"you have to long-press the volume up button, which is also weird because volume up faces behind you and volume down faces in front of you.  "
i definitely don't like the controls.- battery life
": the battery life is really good, these will last all day and they charge nice and fast too.  "
battery info is not so good.  
"these will stay up near 90-100% for most of the day, then they'll drop to 60 pretty quickly and then 30% is dead, basically.  "
"when the voice says your battery level is low, they'll be dead within minutes.- sweat resistance: i can't say just yet, as i started using these in cooler, less humid weather.  "
"sweat is what killed my beats and my redfoxes, both premium brands.  "
maybe i'm too sweaty.  
at least i can replace these after every summer if i have to.
"in summary, these are perfectly decent, and an incredible value.  "
"i still desire a pair of nice, premium, impeccably designed earbuds to wear all day, but these are perfect for the meantime, and i'd probably keep a pair of these around as a backup even if i decide to try another pair of the expensive kind."
day 5 review:
"these are phenomenal and has super long range, i've not truly tested the battery life yet"
but no complaints.
the main thing that i'm super happy about is that these can be on my 2nd floor and i can be in the basement
and i can still hear without static or disconnection.
i hope they last
but so far i'm super happy and excited about this purchase
", i bought the $1.xx square insurance because i've bought like 5 other brands that died and stopped working after 6 months to a year."
"so, i got plan b even if these don't last."
"so far, highly recommend, i'll update if they start being bad."
haha.
"i've only used these twice, once around the house and once for a workout."
"i can't comment on the battery life yet, but overall i was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable they are and how they stay put in my ears."
"they stay put really well even while jogging, and i love that there's no cord flopping around or extraneous noise from said cord--you know, because they are cordless!"
the quality case and extra ear bud tips with bonus foam tips are a nice touch.
right now i'm happy
w/
"the rubber/silicone tips, but may give the foam ones a try."
the headphones  seem pretty sturdy and are light enough that you don't really feel them while you're running or moving around.
my only complaints are:1.
"the ear hooks are too long and don't sit on my ears, they just stick up in a useless way--it would be nice if they were adjustable."
"i am a petite female, so maybe they would fit better on an average sized human."
i will say they don't interfere in any way with my glasses.2.
"the neck strap is kinked and stiff and a bit annoying, but i'll try the clip that comes with it to shorten it."
"you could easily just cut the neck strap off, but i think it's a good, handy feature if you ever want to take the ear buds out to talk to someone or just take a break and hang them around your neck.3."
i wish there was some indication of battery life left.
it's a guessing game.
they do charge pretty fast--in about an hour using a usb port on my laptop.
"overall, highly recommend--nice product at a very good price, and easily paired with my ipod nano 7th gen) and iphone se."
"i should add i mostly listen to podcasts while i work out, so sound quality is not a huge issue for me, but i do think the sound quality is quite good.  "
give them a try--for around $20 you can't go wrong.
these headphones are a steal.
"for the last 7 years of my life i’ve been using bose headphones, day in day out"
i’ve always been a brand snob.
but i got these becaus
i wanted some wireless headphones to play baskettball with that wouldn’t have the long wires.
wow did i hit the jackpot with these.
"the battery life is an easy 7 hours, and that’s not like a leave it on"
and it’ll die in 7 hours that’s play loud music for 7 hours.
"also the range on the bluetooth is increadible, i’ve forgotten my phone in a room at school and not realized it until i stepped out of the room and was halfway down the hall, at least 100 yards through a wall."
i regularly leave my phone on the side of a baskettball court and can run the whole court without ever having any sort of connectivity issues at all.
the sound quality is what really blew me away though.
these really are right on par with the bose headphones.
now the ones i have are 2 years old and a no longer made model.
but these still go toe to toe with a brand that costs at least 4x as much.
they really are the best value headphones
i’ve had in a long time.
if you have been looking for a good pair of headphones but don’t want to get screwed on price go for these.
you won’t regret the purchase!
shockingly enough my first 2 reviews got deleted.
however.
this is my 4th pair of these.
the sound quality is great.
pairing is great.
they just drop dead at about 1-1.5 months.
sadly that happened today.  
the company normally contacts and replaces.
but no such luck this time.
beware.
they’re great for $20.
but realize you’ll need multiple to make it a year
i bought a pair of these headphones.
the first time i used them i noticed that the sound was cutting in and out virtually the entire time i was using them.
my phone was no more than 3-4 feet away the whole time.
"lastly, they died and will not charge."
i’ve only been able to get one use out of them.
i have only had these headphones a week
and i can with all honesty
say i absolutely love these.
"i don't believe anything is perfect, there is always room for improvement."
i gave this product an overall 5-star rating and here's why.
packaging:
the packaging is very nice and you even get a little carrying pouch that holds the headphones and interchangable earbuds.
it comes with a total of 4 earbud pairs to fit different sizes.
i personally use the foam ones.
comfort:
these are surprisingly comfortable.
when i'm working away with these on
i forget i'm wearing them
and i have fallen asleep with them on.
design:
overall i really like the design.
mine are blue and grey
and i wish i would have seen the tiffany blue ones before these because that is my favorite color.
i love these regardless though.
material quality:
these feel durable and not like fake plastic.
the top piece that goes over the top of the ear is actually soft and realitivly flexible.
sound quality: this is possibly the best sound quality you can get with earbuds for the price.
you can comfortably listen to music or what have you and still be aware of your surroundings.
i am discovering sounds and instruments in songs
i haven't heard before.
battery life: i use these while i am working my desk job.
8 hours straight 5 days a week.
after a days shift 3/4ths of the battery is still charged.
as i've stated above no product is perfect so i will list a few things that in my opinion could use some improvement.
microphone placement: you have to have the right
ear piece off if you're going to be using the microphone.
it's located on the inner side of the right ear piece.
i personally find the placement annoying if i need to make any calls
but it is still doable.
intruction booklet: i had an easier time figuring out how to use the controls by just messing with the headphones rather than reading the actual instructions.
it's mainly just pictures with labels.
the cord: i'm aware this is a necessity however if it were a tad more flexible it would be more convenient for me.
"in conclusion for the price i paid, $20.99, this is almost a steal."
"i am very satisfied with this product and when these go out, (because no headphones last forever)"
i will definitely get another pair.
great headphones for those who have small ears/ear canals!
i have had the hardest time finding earbuds that would stay in my ears at all especially when working out
and i need my music to work out!
"i have tried several stating they had different sizes and would fit small ears, but they would still fall out at the smallest tilt of my head."
i have been searching and reading reviews for awhile and decided to give these a shot...and what do you know they actually stayed in my ears for an entire 90 min workout!!
"i did have to do some adjusting a few times, but they stayed in my ears"
and i have not found any earbuds that would prior!
i sweat too much to use the over the ears kind and really felt dumb wearing those anyways.
"i gotta give these 5 stars for just the fact they weren't making me crazy constantly trying to keep them from falling, but they aren't bad in sound quality either."
"probably a little heavy on the bass output, but they are a great buy especially for the price!"
the sound is great!
"they connect wirelessly with ease, i didn't even have to read the instructions."
it repels sweat really well and stays on very securely.
the color is very vibrant and the range and battery life are excellent.
what i truly love about them is the fact that they came with additional earbud pieces.
i could fit the tiny buds perfectly into my ears because the bigger ones don't fit and hurt after a while.
"oh, also the circular case and box is pretty dope."
my only complaint would be the fact that the cord that wraps around the back of the neck doesn't fit securely like in the pictures.
it hangs down kinda awkwardly
and i do wish there was a way to shorten the cord.
"other than that, they're awesome!"
i love these things.
i initially bought them
so i could listen to and learn songs quickly while playing at a dueling piano bar
but i've started using them for morning walks as well.
the sound is great.
(very good bass response)
they fit well and stay in place.
the value is phenomenal.
if i could give them 6 stars i would.
i also have the over ear bluetooth headphones and while i would rate them 4.5 stars they are an amazing value as well.
as far as i've been able to tell you can't go wrong with mpow.
i've never had wireless headphones before so i wasn't sure what to buy
but i'm very happy with these.  
they worked first
try
and i'm not too up on my electronics
"so if i could figure it out, anyone can.  "
don't have to worry about getting the wires tangled or falling out of the ears - which i always have a problem with.  
i didn't choose a rating for moisture wicking because i haven't sweat that much yet.  
:)
update: 11-08-2018i've now been using these for about 9 months and have had 2 issues1-
the memory foam ear buds broke down and i had to replace them.  
these are pretty cheap to replace so not a huge issues2-
the left side is cutting out intermittently.  
based on the price i kind of figured this would happen.
"overall, these have worked great with no issues.  "
if the left side doesn't clear up on its own i will probably buy another pair.
i've had these for just over a week and i am very pleased with them.  
i needed to have over-the-ear headphones because those little in-the-ear wings that most headphones have just will not stay put.  
i'm happy to report that these stay put in a variety of situations.  
i've done both resistance workouts and cardio workouts with them
and they barely moved.  
"i would recommend using the standard ear plugs instead of the memory foam, however, if you sweat a lot.  "
with a lot of sweat and/or vigorous movement
"they won't stay super locked in the ear canal, but i don't mind that-"
they don't pop out or fall off either.
"while sitting at my desk or going out for a walk, i use the memory foam plugs and they work great.  "
they cancel 80-90% of the ambient noise and (most importantly)
wind.  
i just got back from a walk on a very windy day
"and although i could still hear the wind, it was"
more like it was in the background-
it didn't affect the sound at all.  
the memory foam plugs also really enhance the sound quality.
i'm not an audiophile
"so i can't really speak to sound quality, but to me they sound great.  "
"just as good as any other headphones i have ever had, and better than most."
"overall i am very impressed with these, and you simply cannot beat the price.  "
"they are comfortable, they stay put, and the sound quality is good."
"i don't know how long they will last, but"
"even if they only last 6 months, i will still buy another pair.  "
i just wish they came in green.  
:)
orig review was 3 stars::: see
update below
--these were ok.
"the ear loops are a tad big, so they fit loosely on me-a woman with small to med ears."
"no way to adjust them, but they are ok."
"also, i bought these to use on my samsung pc-a fully contained-all inclusive touch screen pc."
"it's large & sits at the back edge of my desk, so regular earbuds don't quite reach-or if they do, one minor movement yanks them out of my ears"
-
"so, i bought these wireless ones."
"however, i've found that when using these, when attempting to watch a video on youtube, or facebook, the video is halting, there are volume issues, then they usually freeze on screen and willl not continue.  "
"so, at first i thought it was my pc or the ""channel"""
i was on-
"but as soon as i unpaired these, hooked up my old earbuds, all videos stream perfectly now."
but these do work perfecty with my kindle for listening to audio books.5-9-18 update
--these folks read my review and were so customer concerned that they sent me another pair of wireless ear buds in a different style!
i was blown away!
this 2nd style has one of the horse collars to wear around your neck and they're wonderful!
"great sound, ease of pairing with my phone."
"it bings when it's turned on, and a little voice states ""turned off"" when you do so- which helps keep the charge going because you aren't searching for the teeny red light to see if it's off love these and love this company for customer service!"
update:
the company sent another set of headphones in response to my first review.
i continue to stand by my review of the original set of headphones hence why i will keep the rating at a one star.
they are a good deal for the price.
they work fine
but i don’t like the echoing of the cord every time you touch the cord.
the 2nd set of headphones were not the same kind.
they are the cheetah version which looks to be a step up from the ones i purchased
so i legitimately cannot change the rating of this review based on the replacements as this is a totally different set of headphones.  
the cheetahs are better with the echoing as the cord does not dangle and have decent sound.
i’ll give the company 4 stars for customer service as they messaged me and sent a new pair.
they are very interested in ensuring you are happy i appreciate this
but they sent another email after receiving the 2nd headphones asking me to change my review.
i’m not sure i agree with this tactic since the review is for the product itself and the product is not faulty
i just don’t like it.
original review below
:the headphones are alright.
what i don’t like is the sound quality.
every time you touch the  cord that connects the two headphones you can hear a thud type sound.
or while running almost as if echoing as the headphones or cord moves.  
not impressed and not sure how these headphones have so positive many ratings.
"what can i say, these wireless headphones look really nice and fit very comfortably."
the price is unbeatable for the quality.
you get 4 sets of ear plugs and 1 set of ear cushions.
set up was a breeze and they came fully charged at 100%.they work very well and taking a call sounded very good.
they are preset to have more bass on avaerage which was my experience
so i just went into setting and lowered it to my listening style/comfort.
i saw these on a youtube channel called unbox therapy and like i said for 20 bucks you cant go wrong.
if you loose them big deal
just 20 bucks buy another pair.
these do rival more expensive wireless headphones.
buy a few for your family.
enjoy!
"my husband complained about the sound cutting in an out, so i returned it and wrote a review saying i must have received a defective pair."
customer service reached out to me and sent me another pair to try out!!!!  
"not only is my son impressed with these headphones, he loves the fact that they actually fit!!"
"he has smaller ears than most and has a hard time finding the right headphones, but he loves these!!"
i am extremely impressed with the customer service and quality of the headphones.
these are definitely worth the price!!
i really like these the sound was good music/talk.
it would tell you when you had an incoming call.
it would still play background music/ noise while you were on a call.
"but mines suddenly stop working,  "
the indicator light doesn't display anymore unless it's charging even till then
"the light is blue from my, recollection"
"that means it's fully charged, i can't get it to pair to my phone anymore, it barely comes on."
it wasn't dropped or in water
so i'm stuck searching for a new pair.
after posting the review above i received a replacement pair that i wasn't expecting.
kudos to this company for staying on top of your reviews and taking action even when it wasn't asked of you.
"although i haven't had a chance to use them much, i still stand by my facts above"
oh
and did i mention
it comes charged and
pairing is so easy.  
"it comes with a small usb cord, extra ear plugs, and it's own carrying case."
"i’ve been using these for about 6 months now and they have exceeded my expectations for cheap, non-brand name bluetooth headphones."
i’ve used a couple different ones from amazon before this and this set has exceeded them in battery life and effective range of connection.
other brands would only last me about 2-3 hours of use before needing to recharge (after about 6-8 months of use and charging) and those other ones would lose connection just by stepping to the other side of the bench at the gym.
"these headphones, after 6 months of constant use) will last me about 1.5-2 weeks of gym use (approx 10 hours of play time combined) and the range has been proven to about 20 feet with metal gym equipment in between my phone and the headset."
the sound quality is good enough for me.
i’m
no audiophile
but i don’t like cheap sounding headphones.
"if you need a cheap set, this is your one!"
bought them for my husband who works outdoors with heavy machinery.
"he reports that they are still comfortable, don't fall off easily, have good audio, reaches fairly far on bluetooth, and the battery lasts him anywhere from 8-12 hours."
"he says occasionally it will give a short burst of static, but it sounds more like a short in wiring than radiostatic and it only happens while his phone is specifically in his left pocket and"
it only last a split second.
he still loves them regardless and with his review i would definitely buy again.
update 2:
i have been using the replacement i received in the exactly same way as before.
"not only it has been working well, but i noticed that it is much easier to connect the new one via bluetooth unlike the original one, which i had to try several times."
"after all, i have to  say that the original one must have come from a defective batch."
update 1:
i changed the rating from one star to three stars for the customer service.
i just received a replacement product from patozon amazon store (i didn't ask for this).
i'll update the rating depending on how the replacement will do.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------it stopped working suddenly after 1-1/2 months - it had been working great while running.
i didn't have to recharge more than once a week.
"then, it stopped working suddenly in the middle of running after 1-1/2 months later."
first i thought i needed to recharge.
"i connected to the charger, but the light didn't come on."
"i tried to turn on, the light didn't brink at all."
sadly it is dead.
these headphones fit great.
i can wear them with the cord behind my neck or dangling under my chin.
(they don't touch my chin).  
i was got a sub standard headphone and the folks sent out a replacement headset.
these have functioned much better!  
i love the fact that i can connect both my work and personal phones at the same time.
simple and effective.
"pros -- i'm no audiophile, but to me the sound quality is excellent."
these are noticeably better than any other headphones
i have.-
the case is extremely helpful.
it keeps the cords from getting tangled up or them from getting smashed.- price is excellent.- never had an issue with battery life.
i can confirm that they can go for at least 3 hours (probably more) listening to loud music without issues.
cons -- when i'm running i can hear something clicking/rattling in them.
"it's not enough to not make me want to take them off or buy new ones, but it can be a little frustrating."
"summary - perfect for day-to-day use, making phone calls, and lifting weights in the gym."
i actually didn’t like these headphones very much because of the size.
the sound was great
but i didn’t like the look or feel.
before you buy these headphones i would suggest talking to their customer service.
they were great.
they helped me find a pair of their headphones that still sounded amazing but had a much sleeker design.
now if the size does not bother you then these headphones are perfect.
the sound quality is amazing and the battery life is awesome.
not to mention the case it came in was super cool.
these have an amazing sound and solid functionality.
the extra ear
bud sizes are nice and i have yet to try the memory foam accessory to see how those feel.
however...my main complaint is likely starting to overshadow the good aspects
and i'm trying to find something else that will work for my workouts.
"the issue is that the over-the-ear loops are too big (as another commenter put, they feel like they're made for elephants)."
"for those of us that need the over-the-ear loop to keep headphones in a comfortable place, these just don't work."
and the fact that they aren't detachable with different sizes means there's not much that can be done about it.
long runs aren't enjoyable with these because i'm consistently adjusting the fit.
maybe i just have weird sized ears...will be finding another brand or model to try.
update:
the seller sent me a replacement pair of headphones (different mpow model).
these worked for about 3 months and then stopped working.
seems to be a poor quality company.
"these earbuds worked great for me, especially when i do exercises."
they fit comfortably in my ears and i don’t have to worry about them falling off.
"the bluetooth does connect really fast as stated and they charge pretty quickly too, about an hour at least for full charge."
they last a whole day and i like that they come in a little case instead of just a bag.
"also cool thing is that on my iphone, it shows the battery life of my earbuds (see images)."
"the earbuds are a bit on bulky side, but it did it"
’s job and
that’s what i like about.
especially for the price you get.
"i don't know if i got a defective pair, however, they are not holding a charge."
"i charged them, used them for 10 minutes and then shut them off."
the next morning i went to use them and they were dead!
the music has static in the background and the calls are even worse.
"either these are terrible and you get what you pay for, or my pair are defective."
i am not happy about this
i sent a review to the company but have not heard anything back from them.
extremely disappointed.
i guess you get what you pay for. :(
"poor sound quality, poor fit, poor durability."
i purchased this product for my wife for use at the gym.
the most important quality for her was that it was waterproof as she spends quite a bit of time in the sauna after her workout.
the earbuds only lasted a week before one of the two earpieces went dead.
furthermore the loops that go over the ear are not adjustable.
those with smaller ears will have a hard time keeping these things in place during a workout.
sound quality is just junk.
"the little wired earbuds that are normally packed in with new cell phones are much, much better."
bluetooth range on these is also poor.
the only reason i gave this two stars is that it at least paired with the phone and worked.
update:
6/25/18the seller contacted me shortly after i left this review to inform me that they are sending me a replacement free of charge.
"understand that i did not ask for a replacement or reach out to the vendor at all, they reached out to me (+1 star for unexpectedly good customer"
"service)that being said, they sent me a light blue mpow cheeta rather than the flame."
as such my wife gave them to me and took my other bluetooth headphones.
that being said (vendor giving these to me for free)
here's what i think of it:
first of all the mpow cheeta sounds better.
"decent bass, kinda warm mids, and highs are not lost."
"works best with pop, less so with rock, and just serviceable with hip-hop and edm.waterproofing is better."
i've taken several showers with these after a workout and haven't had any failures.
bluetooth range and battery life is also improved on the cheeta.
still has issues with fitment.
this time the cord connecting the two earpieces is semi rigid and has a permanent curl to it.
this has the effect of only allowing the user to route the cable behind one's head.
simply put the cable gets in the way when doing bar squats or bench work.
the cable is also a bit too short and non-adjustable.
"i have a fairly large head (about a 7"" 5/8 hat size)"
and so the cheetas barely fit me.
"an annoying issue, they often pull out of my ear if i rotate my head too far."
"the cheetas may work for you if you have a normal or smaller head, listen to pop more than rock, and don't mind taking them off for bar squats or bench work."
i love these headphones -- when they work.  
i purchased these in march.  
they died in june.  
mpow sent me a replacement.  
those died in october.  
"when i asked for another warranty replacement -- they just said, and i quote:thanks for your reply"
", we really want the item work for our customers, but now we have not find out the problem and improve this product currently and would not like to send any defective product to our customer."
so that we would like to refund you in this case
and maybe you can search other headsets you like on amazon.
"is this will be ok for you?so:  responsive customer service, but a product with known problems that they continue to sell on amazon.  "
"i would recommend following their advice and ""search other headsets you like on amazon."""
"don't work and no working customer service number, that works, for support!"
i'm wondering whether this company went out of business and so their products are being sold at discount from amazon
"to just get rid of them?!update: i call amazon cs, got an overseas representative"
", we couldn't communicate, after 20 minutes of back and forth"
he asked if i was requesting a usa rep.
"once i caught on, i quickly said yes, was transferred to another overseas representative where i again asked for a usa rep, was on hold another 10 minutes and finally connected to the usa rep"
.
"i explained my predicament, was on hold another 10 minutes and then transferred to a rep from mpow cs."
"explained again, tested again and again (the same way i had done too many times to count!), transferred again after holding again for 10 minutes to someone who told me that the headphones were defective (no kidding?!) and to follow the instructions in the email they are sending me."
my total phone call time was 56:12
"and then the only email i received was about a ""screen protector shield"", nothing about these headphones!"
i'm done!!!
update: the company sent a couple extra pairs for the ones that burned out.  
"i waited until i've used them a long time, but must admit the new pairs worked fine and without issues.  "
"add in the customer service, and these are 5 stars now."
"bought 2 pair on june 26th, both are in the trash on july 18th.  "
"the first pair worked for awhile, but then started making a hissing sound when charging on a normal usb charger.  "
"when i picked them up, they smell like burning electronics.  "
i didn't want a fire in my ear
so i threw them away and started using the second pair.  
today those are dead and won't take charge.
"be warned, in my experience these have issues with the batteries or charging."
"if you plan to use these for any kind of activity where your body is moving, i suggest looking elsewhere."
"the ear buds are extremely uncomfortable, and the hooks that go over your ears are not adjustable and come nowhere near touching my ear."
after about 15' of running they start to hurt my ear - another 15' and they start falling out.
"this is extremely frustrating for a pair of headphones i bought almost exclusively for the purpose of running (and, given the pictures in the ad, i thought they would be well-suited for this purpose)."
i tried to give them a chance on the stationary bike and while weight lifting - same problem.
you literally cannot move your body or head at all for these to work properly.
at $24 these headphones were bought exclusively for intense workout sessions which last from 35-45 minutes per day 5 days a week.
i am using the memory foam tips and they allow just enough outside noise to be heard in case something requires my attention.
"the sound quality after eq adjustments are slightly muddy on the low end, but overall the audio is easily on par with a pair of jaybirds."
"these headphones do not have aptx, but while i workout i do not need that function from these headphones; i have different pair of headphones with aptx meant for outside exercise usage."
"i am using this pair with an android phone running oreo 8.1 and all controls work perfectly with: youtube, play music, podcast addict, spotify, and vlc player."
"at the end of the day, these headphones are a solid product and at less than $30 they are an absolute steal."
the good:1.
music quality is great for a $20 headphone2.
"long, reliable battery lifethe mediocre:1."
pairing is often difficult.  
i've had to remove and repair a couple of times
"but it seems to work alright now; however, i rarely use because of ""the bad""the bad:2."
phone call mic sounds is awful.  
i've never had a successful phone call because others on the line complain that there's a loud interference-type noise.  
"it could be interference, but i didn't have this problem with my favorite axgio earbuds (no longer in production).  "
"for this reason, only 2 stars because the headphones are rendered useless for me without the ability to talk on conference calls"
bought them may 29th and the headphones stopped turning on in october.
i thought if i gave them a bit of a break the headphones would turn back on
but no.
when i tried to charge the headphones no light even came on.
i'm really disappointed because in the beginning there were no issues with the headphones.
i purchased these mainly for the price.  
i needed a new pair for when i work out and didn't want to spend too much.  
i also have a pair of mpow over the ear headphones for computer listening
so i was familiar with the brand.
i am happy overall with these.
"the sound is pretty clear and full, not bass or treble heavy."
they are light weight
and i never really 'feel' them while working out.
i did (7) hour plus work outs before recharging and i probably could have gotten one more.  
i would say the 7-9 hour play time between charges is accurate.
these are very fast pairing.  
from the time i first push the power button to paired and ready to go is about 7 seconds.
i have never found an ear bud style of headphone that has fit totally securely in my right ear.  
not sure why but the left ear fits snuggly
but the right always feels 'loose'.  
these are no exception.  
even with the largest supplied buds the right ear doesn't feel at tight fitting as i would like.
this is not necessarily the ear buds fault but it would be nice if they had included one more larger size replacement bud.
with that being said i have not had these fall out during a work out.
overall i would say the mpow flame bluetooth headphones are an excellent value for the money.  
give them a try.
so looking past the ear hangers are freaking huge.
the title for these states that it is ipx7.
which by definition means less than 30 minutes no deeper than 1 meter.
"in the description it says ""ipx7 water-resistant""."
which is is not a real rating.
since ipx6 is suppose to protect against splashing i figured a higher rating with an actual submersion rating would be ok against minor splashing.
"this is clearly false advertisement, so just be aware of what you want to use these for."
i wear these sitting in my hot tub.
i was splashed on one side of my head effectively splashing one of the ear pieces.
and it stopped working.
these are not waterproof as the rating they advertise states and they are hardly water resistant.
"flip side is that the sound is ok for headphones that sit on your ear, but had i know one would have stopped working after being splashed i would have chose a set that was actually ipx7.update: so their customer service is pretty on top of things."
they sent me another set and they work.
"i still find it hard to confirm the ipx7 rating, but i can submerge them and continue to use them."
it would be nice if the ear hooks were adjustable.
these flame earphones are awful!
i didn’t expect them to be perfect for the price
but i did expect them to be functional.
the part that goes on your ear is completely floppy and flimsy.
not only is it huge
but it is so soft that it won’t hold in place!
"the buds that go into your ear won’t stay on their own, and there is a huge bulge just after the part that goes into the ear which prevents it from sitting inside well."
sound is ok (if you’re holding it to your ear) and the one conversation i attempted to have the caller did not complain about odd sounds while speaking.
overall poor construction and unusable!
i’m returning it
and it only just arrived on friday.
never again!update:
"i was contacted by the seller due to my dissatisfaction, and because the set i ordered had “floppy and flimsy” ear pieces"
", they sent me their cheetah headset without cost."
the new set certainly resolved that issue and holds boxes in place.
"however the audio was subpar and made the sound muffled, soft and barely audible on the highest level (on my end, although the person on the other end did not have issues hearing)."
the left earpiece pressed awkwardly and caused me some pain when using for more than an hour.
then the battery life was poor (used for 4hrs of calls
and then it was on standby overnight.
"by the time i woke, it was completely dead."
"i increased the rating to a 3 only because of the customer service, but the products themselves are lacking."
i bought this item because of all of the good reviews.
i did a lot of research before purchasing it.
"i don't use the headset that often, only when i'm around other people."
went on vacation to find that no one in our party including my techy teenage son could get the same to work.
i went to return it on amazon to find that it was one day after the return date had expired.
"i'm assuming that i got a defective pair, but unfortunately the manufacturer's return window was so small that i'm out of luck."
sad waste of money.
update: customer service
so my review and sent me a new pair.
"that was very kind of them, but unfortunately that pair did not work with my phone either."
it seems to be a problem with the blu r1+ running android version 6. 0.
"i still don't have a working pair of headphones, a customer service did all that they could."
"updatethe nice folks at mpow sent me a replacement, i have now used it for a bit and here is what i can add to my review."
i do not believe this one has much more battery life than the previous one.
"also when it goes into low battery mode, it does not give much warning before it shuts off."
it still does not come close to 7-9 hrs of playback.
"originali believe if you never use it the battery life would be fine, but then what is the point."
i use this to listen to music while working in the yard.
i can get phone calls and not have to dig into my pocket to find my phone.
"but after maybe an hour, i start getting a low battery warning."
they were fully charged when i started.
"there are some nice positives about these, but they don't count if the battery is always dying.- very short battery life after full charge- memory foam ear pieces fit nicely and block out lots of background noise- very easy to connect to bluetooth- not very intelligent, it does not tell you how much battery power is left on turn on"
this is what i wrote after owning them for a short time.  
"i've had a bunch of headsets i use for running, mowing the lawn and all sorts of less sweat intensive activities.  "
this one is pretty good.  
"first, it's loud.  "
"all others i've run with on full volume, and mostly they would get drowned out by passing traffic.  "
some songs have really loud recording levels but old cds that i've turned into mp3s often have a soft recording level.  
mowing the lawn with the old ones was nearly useless.  
this one is great!  
"in most cases, running i don't have the volume all the way up.  "
"mowing the lawn, i do."
my two criticisms are: 1.  
the strap connecting the left and right speaker looks dumb if i put it under my chin and sticks to my sweaty neck while running and checking both ways before crossing the street.  
"since it has the things going over my ears, they stay in place, but turning your head will partially pull the speaker out of your ear; and 2.  "
"not many will care about this, but if you run in cold weather, the speakers are so big, it will be very hard to keep your ears warm.  "
the coldest i've run in 2018
is - 8 f.  
"at that temp i leave the headset at home, because, i can't keep my ears warm."
this is what i'm writing after a little less than a year.  
"overall, i used them for nearly a year before they failed.  "
i ran on a day where the humidity was very high and sweated a lot.  
"i've had these where i sweat so much, sweat gets into the headset and the speaker won't play, but after they dried out it played again.  "
"i didn't run into that problem this time, instead, i charged them up and when i tried turning them on, they would never turn on."
i didn't realize they had a 24 month warranty
"or i would have followed up on that, but i threw them out and tried other headsets."
three main criticisms: 1.  
"the cord connecting the earbuds looks dumb when under my chin, but it sticks to my neck when put in back and partially pulled out when i looked behind me;"
2.
"sound, at first i thought they were great, but as time went on they became softer and due to recording levels of music i've put on my phone, some songs couldn't be heard when mowing the lawn; and 3. failure to turn on, these failed at about a year, but i bought another pair of mpow bluetooth wireless headset and it failed the exact same way after a week.  "
"it would charge, but would not turn on."
"i wish i'd tested the warranty, because that was something i probably could have told about"
i've had these for 6 months.
barley used them.
they finally 'died' last week.
"however, my phone states it has 50% battery life"
"and they keep saying ""battery low"" then shutting off."
i tried to charge on four different chargers but it will not.
"no light up, nothing."
even from different sources such as the car and computer.
it makes no sense.
"as i said, i barely used them, they were used on a treadmill from which it didn't get wet."
there's no excuse as to why this is happening other than the manufacturing.
"after further research, i am not alone."
i just recently purchased these headsets so this an initial review.1.
"with the right earpiece, the bass is excellent  10/102."
"battery life is great,also with the right app you can get a bluetooth battery widget that's fully compatible with this headset 10/103."
material is plastic
so take that how you please 8/10overall
this is an excellent headset.
also get the 3 year warranty for 6.99.
just in case factor
"coming from $80 name brand bluetooth headphones, these are a great deal."
pros:soundbluetooth connectivity.
-
"no loss of connection, tells you how much battery you have left, and pairs quickly and easily to my nexus 5x and ford sync."
"comfort (sort of, more on that in cons tho.)cons:"
"while comfortable, i don't feel confident they will stay on."
not because of the ear buds though.
more due to the flimsy ear hook and larger size of the headphones.
they look like blue 2x4 lego bricks.
but the earhooks do not really sit on the top of my ears.
they hover just slightly off the top of my ears.
"and with the way the ""lego brick"" sticks out forward toward my face causes the headphones to point outward from my head because the earhooks are flimsy and sitting higher than the top of my ears."
and the back of my ear is barely touching the back of the hook.
but since you can't adjust the earhooks in anyway
i have deducted two stars as this affects the look when wearing and little confidence they will stay on while working out.
"for reference i am 5'8""."
update:
i prefer not to wear these anymore because the fit just is not good.
i have to wear a hat while working out to keep the ear hooks and headphones in place or against my head.
"also, i realized the illustrations for this product say the ear hook is adjustable which is entirely false.update #2:"
great customer service!
patozon customer service team contacted me and offered a replacement with a different model.
they sent me an mpow cheetah.
i like it a lot more than the flame.
i've even taken it with me mountain biking.
i'm able to leave it in on one ear and off on the other
so i can still pay attention to other riders and people using the trails.
"it feels much more snug around my head as the whole thing basically wraps around my head, but doesn't interfere with wearing a helmet."
i will leave a review for it on the cheetah product page.
"horrible, horrible, horrible!!!  "
beware!!  
do not believe all the false “positive “ reviews.  
"it worked great for two months, but now completely worthless!  "
"never got them wet, or sweaty.  "
"they will power on, and act like it wants to connect, then it refuses to connect.  "
"went thru this several times , trying to connect with my ipad and iphone.  "
neither wanted to connect.  
"now, outside my window to return, too!  "
so.
just screwed!
has to purchase these  a second time because my dog ate my first pair
i have to say these headphones have excellent babies excellent
so i work in a call center
and i work on the chat side of things
so i don’t have to speak with customers and we are allowed to have headphones at work these work out
everything people have to literally tap me to get my attention music and that’s not even on the highest setting your stylish to come tomorrow because of multiple earpieces to make sure they try and accommodate the most ear canal opening types as they can i have nothing negative to say about these
and as someone who has an iphone andhas use the iphone headphones
i can say that these are a strong contingent and if i can’t find my iphone headphones which i normally can’t
i will use these instead for the most part i use these headphones over the iphone headphones that came with my iphone which i think says something because there’s nothing wrong with the iphone headphones.
the cute case is awesome as well.
i bought this brand as it was rated fairly high by consumers and consumer rating agencies.
i am so very disappointed!
i am returning it
(thank god
it's within the allotted time framed!)
", because bluetooth stopped working after only four times!!!"
three times at the gym w/wifi and 1 time at home w/personal wifi!!
!
i had to disconnect/reconnect and repeat!
it is not worth this kind of inconvenience/hassle/frustration for the price!!
it seemed just too good to be true!
don't buy it.
don’t ever let these headphones die.
they cannot come back from dying.
i’ve had two different sets in the last three months and they work great till they don’t.
to the company’s credit they do have an 18 month warranty where you can exchange or be refunded for broken headsets.
they have fast customer service as well.
i just don’t think these headphones are good quality if they can’t be charged after the battery dies.
"i am dissapointed, i loved my headphones and they seemed like a fantastic value until they died."
i thought initially i had a bad set
but when it happened to the replacements mpow sent me
i began to think it was a manufacture defect of the product
and i don’t care to keep getting replacement after replacement.
i’d rather invest my money in something that will work better.
these headphones are awesome!
i bought two pair: one for me and one for my husband.
"i noticed that when he used them to talk to me handsfree, it sounded like he was in a tunnel."
they aren’t great for canceling out the outside noises and even at the highest volume you can’t really hear someone over wind or rain.
"also, we noticed that because of where the microphone is located, if you’re using these to talk handsfree while driving, they will pick up the sound of your car’s heat or ac and make it sound even more like you’re in a tunnel."
"so not great for talking on the phone but fantastic for watching movies or listening to music, which was half of the reason we bought them."
my husband actually wound up dropping his outside and backing over them with the car.
"for sitting out in the rain and then being run over, they held up surprisingly well."
you can tell they’re really well constructed.
part of one earbud is busted but only part.
the rest is still intact.
totally impressed with the construction.
"it paired & worked fine for 1st time, later i had problem pairing again."
they(patozon) have sent me a replacement fast w/o my asking.
i appreciate their responsible attitude toward their product.
managed to connect/pair & enjoy my music.
thanks.
"ps: if anybody should have problem re-pairing,delete the device/mpow(from control panel"
> devices and printers)and reboot the pc clean & restart the pairing process.
my son bought these with some of his amazon gift card money he got for his birthday.
they arrived at my work and
when i got home he was waiting for me.
"my wife said that he was waiting for me since he got home from school, he immediately started charging them so they were ready the next day."
the next day he woke up at 6 a.m. to try out these with his new mp3 player
(he also got a mp3 by valoin)
but when he tried them on he was disappointed because they were too big for his ears!
he was planing on getting them to replace his headphones that are not wireless and
there also bulky.
now he still uses his not wireless headphones and realizes that he should've got either wireless headphones or get a size of over the ear earbuds
"but, now his moneys gone"
and i don't think were going to buy from this company again and let this be a warning to you if your interested in this product.
"p.s, if the company does not give me a smaller pair or some not so bulky wireless headphones then thats just terrible customer service."
i don’t understand the good reviews because the sound quality is horrible.
"they fit comfortably, stay on your head securely and look like they’re made of good quality materials"
but i just can’t get over how terrible they sound.
i rank these headsets as the worst sounding headsets i’ve ever bought period.
mpow did good on everything else but failed miserably on the most important thing for me.
i will never recommend these headsets.
"mpow, if just you improved the sound quality you’ll potentially have a 5 star headset."
the good:
"good build quality, good sound, good battery life and quick enough charge time."
the bad: this may be subjective but these aren’t comfortable.
they’re not earbuds really because there’s so much built outside of the earbud itself.
and to get the earbud comfortably firm in my ear i have to press this in pretty hard and all of that external material presses hard against my ear.
also bad
: the power button is the red (or whichever color you chose)
metal on the side.
"it’s right where it would be best to press the earbud into my ear so several times trying to adjust the fitting, i’d press that button pausing my music."
i also am not a fan of this and other brands sacrificing buttons by making the volume buttons also be track skip buttons.
i’m always skipping tracks by accident when i just want to control volume.
make separate buttons for volume and tracks please!
"the left earpiece went from normal to pretty quiet within the first week of use, and at this point, it is almost completely silent.  "
very disappointed.  
"since i purchased them for a trip that, at the time, was still a few weeks away, i used them once to make sure they worked and then put them away for the trip.  "
it wasn't until i was well into my trip that i started to have problems.  
now that i'm back home
the return window has closed on this product so i am stuck with these crap headphones.  
i won't trust this company anymore.
edit:  
okay
so apparently at some point the company got in touch with me through amazon about helping to fix this issue.  
i never saw it because the email went to my wife's email (which she never checks).  
so they went on ahead on their own and sent me a replacement set of these headphones.  
that is what i call amazing coustomer service.  
"anyway, i have been using the replacement and i have had no (zero, nadda, zip) issues with them.  "
"they last a good long while on a charge, they connect almost insantly to my device"
", they sound very good, and they fit very well.  "
i thought it was only fair that i update my review.  
"up-ing my stars from 1 to 4, because of how well they work, and adding a 5th because of the great coustomer service."
edit.
got these april and they have alrrady stopped working.
i guess something had to give when you get good sound and a cheap price---these are really good headphones especially if you have an up-to-date phone.
they are already loud and pretty clear but smartthings automatically adjust it to your music based on your preferences.
the wire-clamp is useless but luckily the wire isn't overly long like some other bluetooth headphones i have had.
changing to the smaller tips they fit perfectly in my ear and there isn't that constant cutting out when i jog.
battery also last pretty long on a charge.
i do find it weird that the button in the front when these are on your ears is the button to go to the previous track and the button behind
"is to go forward, weird choice."
if you don't adjust your settings for the buds they will sound very basic
i tested them on two phones all week both up-to-date cells and noticed a huge difference.
also be careful with bluetooth 4.0 disconnect from devices
you don't want to use if you don't want them switching between devices.
in the end anything i was not satisfied with these are completely outweighed by the fact at how inexpensive they are.
$20 can get you a pretty good pair of headphones nowadays.
this however isnt one of them.
"the audio quality isnt terrible, but dont get me wrong, its a long shot from good."
"imagine going to your favorite artists concert, and then shoving cotton balls, ear plugs, and your fingers in your ears, all at once."
thats about how these sound.
"i wouldnt say these are overly comfortable either, go put the end of a banana in your ear"
and youve had the same experience.
they dont stay in well
", i tried all of the tips and none of them keep them in better."
the hooks dont help at all either.
"go feel the cord on your headphones, or your phones charging cord, thats about how sturdy they are, they arent."
"over all ill give them 2 stars because they dont look terrible, but they dont function well at all."
the stock headphones my phone came with out preform these.
i have bought these blwetooth several times and i always lose them or a family member asks for them
and i buy them again
", i do not exchange them for any, they are good, they resist water, the sound is spectacular and the battery lasts around 12 hours, either or listening to music, also the price is very economical"
we like this headphones.
read a lot of reviews and can verify they were great especially for the price.
"i feel like i am missing the midrange sound, but bass and treble are great."
use them with our peloton and work great.
"while the right ear fits great, the left is a little loose with the default buds need to try the other included inserts."
"my only complaint is that we ordered the upgraded version - if you look at their website it should come with the cable clip, redesigned cable and increased battery life."
we ordered 2 - 1 for me and 1 for the wife.
did not come with the cable clip or redesigned cable.
the sku/model number matches the non-upgraded version.
so buyer beware.
just sucks because the standard version was on sale at the time.
i should have bought the standard and saved $8 a pair
i am something of an audiophile and came from some vmoda crossfade m100 headphones to finding myself in need of some bluetooth ear buds.
so maybe i'm a bit snobbish when it comes to sound.
i am 49 years old and the days of needing to rock out are rather behind me
and now i enjoy quality more than volume.
i tried connecting these to my galaxy note 8 and to a fiio x1.
right away in both i noticed the difference in sound quality from what i came from.
for me these sound tinny and the quality is what i would expect from ear buds from a gas station.
i gave them to my son who just needed something to listen to from the soundbar while i was sleeping.
he seems to like them ok.
but he got them for free so that probably helped.
honestly though.
i am likely to buy him a pair of the 1mii bluetooth headphones when i get paid.
they are also cheap but the sound is noticeably better
"let's just say, uhhuh.  "
sound quality is ok.  
battery life is ok.  
the ear buds themselves wont stay in ear
(i use them to cut the grass)  
tried all the different sizes no success.  
the bluetooth signal is terrible.  
if you turn your head it cuts out.  
if the range is 5
ft that's an overstatement.  
i guess you get what you pay for....
seller sent me a different pair.  
the cheetah model.  
night and day difference.  
don't waste your time with flame just buy the cheetah from the start.
bought the earbuds for using in the gym
but they don't last at all.
after 4 times in the gym they stopped working of malfunction and not because the battery went off.
in the middle of the workout they slowly went off and i was not able to load them anymore and also not turn them on again.
i may sweat more than other people but if you praise your product with ip x7 and also with a sweat resistance advertise then it should keep the promise and do not break within one week.
"i did not went inside the pool, rain or shower with the ear buds and also did not wash them inside the dishwasher"
so they at least should be able to stand some sweat like promised.
save your time and money and look for other products.
this ones are not recommendable.
updated: after a month of use the battery life has gone from 7 hours at first use to now only 5 hours.
after only a few weeks there was an on and off buzzing in the left one.  
"today after an hour of use the right one pretty much stopped giving any sound, there was just very low music coming out.  "
turned up to the loudest it would go it was like there was no music
"and i could hear my tv speakers, which were low, and household noises over the headphones."
"original review:  arrived in a damaged box, but all the inside bags looked sealed"
so i thought it was ok.  
80% of the music i play is fuzzy.  
when the music is paused and it should be silent
i hear a buzzing that fades in and out.  
i use while exercising and of course move my head to the music and they always move out of my ear
", i lightly bumped one and it popped out too easily"
i think since these are described to be used during strenuous exercise and they barely handle head movements.
i have to push them back in after every song.  
the piece that goes behind your ear is worthless.  
if the cord is left to loose
"it brushes my neck, if it is too tight it pulls on the ear piece."
it is only ok if i have the cord slightly snug and pull the extra up into my headband in my hair.
"battery - terrible, i used for 6 hours, then based on other reviews i charged it so it wouldn't go dead in the my next workout.  "
the day after charging it only lasted 1 hour.  
that along with the damaged box make me think this was a waste of money and damaged before i received it.
i know its hard to pick an entry level wireless earphones with the 100s of them on amazon.
i had that trouble and with 12000 + reviews its hard to get any insight.  
i will keep this simple and to the point.  
here's my take on this.
first the pros:  1.
"sound quality was decent for the price, though not the best.  "
took a few iterations with the eartips to get to my  personal preferences of bass and treble.  
"distinct lack of the highs, fair midrange and bass  "
2.
"build quality seems good, though some flaws which i will cover later.  "
"dont know about long term quality  though, have had it for too short a time  3."
"seems a fair value for the money, though there are too many at this price point."
now the con's: 1.
very disappointing battery life.
the max i could get  was ~ 2.5 hours.  
looking at the size of the earphone
"i felt i could  get 7-9 hrs as advertised, but wasnt the case.  "
i have had it for a very short time
so expect it will get worse over time2.
aesthetics -  very large and boxy.  
sticks out quite a bit.  
thickness of just the earphone without eartips is about 3/4 + inch.  
i expected a more slim build.  
see my pics3.
build -
the cover for the charging port is so flimsy
i dont expect it will last more than a month.  
its a matter of  design and not a manufacturing defect3.
remembers only the last device connected.
if you change device you have to manually reconnect bluetooth4.
"bluetooth for phone calls was poor for me, audio was scratchy and with gapsverdictwith the choice of wireless headphones, just on amazon, i was disappointed ar this ""bestseller"".  "
my biggest fail was the battery life and next was size and build.  
"overall, i wouldn't buy this"
the good:
"it connected quickly to my phone, and the connection held strong without issues.  "
i was impressed by the bass.
the bad:all i heard was the bass.  
"the mid and high tones were nearly completely overshadowed by the bass, making it sound very muffled."
"the bottom line:i did not like these headphones and returned them.***update***without prior notice, mpow sent me these headphones for free after i wrote this review:https://www.amazon.com/"

"mpow+cheetah+bluetooth+headphones&psc=1kudos to mpow for their customer service, and the new mpow"
cheetah headphones are definitely better quality.  
"however, these still do not change the issues i had with these mpow flame headphones, nor will it affect this review.  "
i have submitted a separate and 5 star review for the new headphones in the link above.  
"the high review is not because i received them for free, but because they were much better quality."
*
*
update**the seller mpow just sent me another set of headphones to try.
"they were actually their cheetah head phones mpow cheetah bluetooth headphones, v4.1"
"wireless sport headphones, behind-ear sweatproof running headset with built-in mic for workout exercise (ipx5 splash proof rating, up to 8 hours of talk time)."
i really wish i had purchased these first!they solve all the issues i had with the flame headphones.
no distortion of sound when my phone is in my pocket and suuper comfortable.
the sound quality is also soo much better.
the only issue is how it fits around my neck when not in use.
"maybe i'm doing it wrong, but it sits weird."
but considering all of the other pros with these headphones i would recommend them in a heart beat.***update***i picked up these headphones because a co-worker of mine was using the over the ear phones of the same brand.
i knew it was a budget
friendly set of headphones
so i expected drawbacks.
however i've had issues with them that i've never experience with other budget headphones like say skullcandy.1.
the sound cuts in and out when my phone is in my pocket.2.
the ear buds on the left side are uncomfortable.
"i've swapped out the ear pieces for the smallest set, yet my ear becomes sore after about 5 mins of use."
i have to dangle my headphones off my ear to get relief.
i don't have small ear canals.
i've never had to change earbuds on any of the skullcandy headphones or my plt legend bluetooth
ear phone
i use for work.3.
the sound quality is mediocre at best.
"i get more bass and sound out of cheap, corded headsets from walgreens."
i've even adjusted the bass and treble on my phone to try and get more sound.
overall it's a pretty decent pair of headphones for the price.
"if they decide to ask for more money in the future, i definitely would not pay it."
"i've only been using them for about a week, and the only issue that i've had with them is that they don't fit my ears perfectly.  "
i have tried the different sizes but none fit perfectly.  
"if i'm just wearing them and being relatively relaxed then there are no issues, but i got the for working out, and when i run for a few mins they work themselves loose.  "
they never fall out just loose.  
the sound quality is surprisingly nice!!  
this product was inexpensive and still maintains an extremely high price for quality ratio!  
there are better than a pair that cost me $60.  
"i think if i do need to replace them, it will be with another pair, maybe just a different color."
"ease of use:  5 stars, the directions are extremely simple to pair and use for controlling the music/phone call."
level of comfort: 4 stars
", it might just be my ears, but maybe send more sizes or use the foam buds (without losing quality)sound quality:"
"4 stars, its not the best pair of bluetooth headphones, but they very adequate for my needs at the gymbattery life:  5 stars"
", again only having it for a week, but the charge has lasted through multiple workouts, mowing the yard, movies on a lunch break...  "
"all on the first charge, maybe i got lucky (which i'm ok with)"
but it seems to just be the overall quality of the deviceprice:  
"5 stars, this product is cheap compared to quite a few other bluetooth sets, yet they did not sacrifice the quality of these headphones"
"update --- 1 year laterunfortunately, these earbuds stopped working about 2 weeks prior to the 1-year mark.  "
the audio is so faint
i can no longer hear out of them.  
soo
now i have to buy another pair & will try a different brand.
they were great while they worked.  
minus the constant tugging to one side.  
disappointing.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------so
far i've been really happy with these.  
"they're lightweight but feel sturdy, audio quality is decent and fantastic for the price.  "
battery life is decent.  
they come in a really nice zip-up carrying case that includes a couple of different sized earpieces & the charger.  
the last pair of earbuds i had were around the same price and didn't come with a nice carrying case.  
i like that they're stripped with red which makes them easier to find in my purse.
they were easy to pair with my device.  
"my last pair from another brand looked similar but didn't even make it 1 year, i hope these will fair much better.  "
"i'll update this review in a year, but so far i've been super happy with them & the price i paid for them."
pros: i am very impressed with these headphones.
"the sound quality is clear, loud, and has no lagging."
it connects just fine to my iphone 7 and my ipad.
"when i talk on the phone, the person i am speaking with is able to hear me loud and clear"
"(which is what i was worried about).cons: the headphones don’t fit that well in my ear, but i’m not too concerned about it because very few headphones actually fit in my ear with no problems or issues."
another con i have is that every time i switch windows in my phone there’s a little pinging sound that plays.
it’s not a deal breaker and it doesn’t even bother me anymore
it’s
just something that i have noticed.
otherwise i am very pleased with this device.
positives:
the sound quality is not too bad.
it has a wide range of highs and lows that it manages to reach.
negatives:i wear hearing aids all the time
so i am used to the idea of something wrapped around my ear.
"however, these ear buds do not sit easy on the ears and gets sore after a short period of time."
the sound gap between right and left is too distinctive.
"if the battery is getting low, the device will calmly interrupt your music to let you know the battery is low multiple times in a song."
which is very irritating.
there is a blue light that shines rather brightly every minute.
i understand the feature is there to let you know its working.
"however, at night it tends to light up a room periodically."
it does not pair with my laptop very well and will occasionally cut out.
overall: if you are looking for something cheap that you get a decent couple hours out of
then this is your go to.
i used these for walking
/jogging quite a bit and had them connected to my phone.
"they sounded decent enough, although sometimes they would cut out for no reason that i could tell, and other times they wouldn't cut out at all."
"the battery life was not as advertised either, and when the power indicator said i had 50% left"
it really meant i had better charge them before i go for an hour's walk.
"anyway, i had them and enjoyed them for the most part but after just a few months they just quit working at all."
no idea
why.
i had them hooked to the charger
and when i came back they wouldn't power up.
i'm shopping for something else now...
update:
i have to add a couple stars for customer service
"and, as it turns out, better sound quality."
"i never contacted the company, but apparently someone there read my review and sent me a replacement pair without me even asking for them."
"as it turns out, i had ordered another set from anker and both sets arrived on the same day."
"so i left the mpows in the box and used the ankers for a couple weeks, but no matter how much i fiddled with them i could not get decent sound from them unless i literally pushed with my hands to hold them in place."
today i pulled out the mpows and what a difference!
half the price and sounds much better.
the controls are easier to use than the ankers as well.
hopefully these will last longer than the first pair.
if they do i'll come back and bump this up to a 5...
i bought these headphones about 6 months ago.  
spoiler: they stopped working.  
"more details here:compared to other inexpensive headphones, these seem much sturdier.  "
the cable that runs from one earpiece to the other is probably 3 times as wide as my similarly-priced jbls.
"the ear hooks are also sturdy, but comfortable."
the battery life is good.  
"i never pushed them, but they had no problem with 7 hours in the gym at a fairly high volume."
they fit snugly in the ear canal and do a decent job of blocking the outside noise.  
"decent, but not great.  "
they are comfortable for my 1+ hour gym sessions.
"after about 6 months of daily use, they suddenly stopped.  "
"i turned them on, they said ""connected,"" then they turned themselves off.  "
i figured it was a dead battery
", so i tried several chargers and cables over the period of a weekend, and none of them even caused the ""charging"" light to come on.  "
they are absolutely dead.
customer service is so-so.  
"they are overseas, so you'll get replies in the middle of the night.  "
"when i got up and sent another message, i didn't get my reply until the next day.  "
that's a little frustrating.  
"after several emails back and forth, they offered to send me a new pair."
"they are supposedly on the way, but i have no idea as to when they'll arrive.  "
hopefully this pair will last longer than the first.
"for the price point, they can't be beat, but for sub-$20 headphones, you can't expect a lot.  "
"that being said, in a year, i went through 3 pairs of a more expensive brand.  "
"if you're going the inexpensive route, my suggestion is to have two pairs, so you'll have one to use while the other is being replaced under warranty."
"i ordered these because i have some mpow headphones that have been great quality, but i have to admit i'm quite disappointed with these.  "
"now i know there really isn't anyone one can do about the shape of their ears, but the ear holders need to be more firm because they would hold the buds closer to the ear and not allow much movement.  "
someone with ears that aren't flat against the side of their head will have issues keeping the buds in their ears.  
on top of that the bluetooth cuts out quite a bit meaning when a song is playing youll hear brief periods of distortion at times before the song continues.  
i thought it was the  mp3 player at first
but the songs play fine on the mp 3 player and they play fine on the mpow headphones
i'd mentioned earlier in this review.
"i was quite happy with their headphones, but not so much with the earphones.***an update to give.  "
without requesting such i received a pair of mpow earphones today in the mail that had sturdier ear clips attached by a more sturdy band.  
while the initial product was not to my satisfaction i am adjusting the review to three stars instead of two due to the fabulous customer service.  
"there are always products that sometimes will not meet expectations, and that is from any manufacturer......"
"but what really makes companies stand out above others is their customer service which, with mpow, i find outstanding."
"these are ""eh""."
"they sound okay for what you pay, and that (along with noise cancellation) is greatly improved by replacing the tips that come on them with the black foam-looking ones that are included."
i am almost never sitting still if i'm wearing my headphones/earbuds.
"i'm moving around a lot, working around the house or in the yard, and most often exercising."
by which i mean running.
"i have been able to make do with these for that purpose, but it's really annoying, because i have to keep pushing them back into my ears, adjusting, etc."
"sometimes i can get them positioned to where they stay longer, but usually i am frequently reaching for my ears."
far inferior to my previous pair from this brand which had a somewhat rigid/fixed behind the neck wire.
i got these after returning a pair of jaybird run's ($140).
i have been very impressed with them so far.
"they charge very quickly, and i get about 2-3 weeks worth of workouts from them on a single charge (three 30-45 min."
"workouts a week).they come with several different sized earbuds, a charging cable (but no wall outlet/plugin), and a soft carrying case."
"for $20, that's an absolute steal."
the connection has not dropped out on my yet (which was a major problem i had with the jaybirds).
i've walked all around my house with them and the signal stays strong.
the controls on the side are easy to use.
"there's a volume up & down, as well as a play/pause button that also allows you to answer calls."
sound quality is about what you'd expect for $20.
"the mids/highs are muddy and dull, there's a lot of bass, but it's not well defined and tends to muddle out everything else."
"i have high standards for sound quality though, as my go-to headphones are audiotechnica m50x's."
"for the average user, the sound quality will suffice."
"and, for me, they're good enough to get me through a work out."
what else could you ask for at a $20 price point?
i really wanted to like these as the sound was great
and it was so nice not having a cord attached to my phone as i ran.  
"sadly, they just would not stay in my ears when i ran.  "
there are 2.
reasons why.  
1.
having the controls on the actual ear pieces themselves makes them too heavy to stay still.  
it's easier to work the controls from my phone anyway so
"for me, this is not a necessary feature.  "
2.
the pieces that wrap around your ears are not shapeable.  
i had an old pair (not bluetooth) where the around the ear pieces were made of a gumby like material so they could securely shape to your ear which really helped the buds stay put and not move at all.  
"i tried all 3 sizes of buds and was able to get one ear to not fall out, but sadly i couldn't get the other ear to stay put"
and i was constantly adjusting them when i ran.  
"i also found that the piece in the back would stick to my neck or shirt as i got sweaty and pull to one side, further making the buds move around, and the piece to secure the strap together popped off during my first run and is now lost forever.  "
sadly i returned these.
will look for a brand that doesn't have the controls on the ears.
these headphones have a lot going for them.
the sound quality is good
"(at least for my meager needs), the battery lasts 8-9 hours on a single charge, the bluetooth connection is quick and reliable, and the price is less than $20."
all big pluses when i’m looking for a pair of headphones.
the downsides?
these headphones are clunky as h
*
*
*.
they’re built using a cheap plastic shell and buttons.
"the result is they’re oversized for their design, protruding from the ears instead of fitting gracefully inside."
"and the plastic click play/pause button requires a firm press to engage, pushing the earbud deep inside the ear canal."
"finally, the long looping rubber piece that fits behind the ear catches on everything, making the headphones clunky (there’s that word again) to put on and remove."
"the saving grace is that once inserted and turned on, the headphones rest comfortably in place and can be worn for hours at a time."
i know i know.
“what did you expect for bluetooth headphones for less than $20 dummy?”
"well smartypants, i’ve bought bluetooth headphones in the past that had all the same pros and still fit and wore comfortably."
unfortunately i couldn't even get a year out of any of them.
so i decided to try something different.
"i imagine these will last two years, much to my consternation."
the manufacturer set out to make an affordable pair of bluetooth headphones that hit on all of the points i mentioned in the first paragraph.
and to that end they succeeded.
but what they gave up in the process is too much counterbalance.
therefore i can’t recommend these headphones nor will i purchase them again myself.
"the sound quality is good, however you cannot turn the volume down very far and they don't block out background noise very well at all."
i bought these to use while mowing my lawn and with other power equipment because the description said they were noise-cancelling.
when i'm using my riding lawn mower i have to turn the volume way up in order to hear the music.
of course with in-canal headsets the loud noise is not good for your hearing.
i also like to have a non-bulky headset that i can use when flying with noise-cancelling to block out the jet engine and human sounds.
"also, i need the volume to be low enough to be comfortable if i want to nap while on the plane."
"the lowest i get it is too loud for my needs, even when i set my ipod touch to its lowest volume setting."
"i do like the fact that they at least stay on your ears, however i still have to push them back into my ear canal because they do come loose while mowing or moving around, especially when i'm sweating."
"they do pair quickly and easily and the pause, skip-ahead, and skip-backward"
selector buttons are quite handy.
"if i had it to do over again, i would not have purchased them for what i intended."
will have to look around for another pair with better features.
you get what you pay for.
"the sound quality is good, however you cannot turn the volume down very far and they don't block out background noise very well at all."

out of the box these paired up with my apple watch easily and initial testing seemed promising.
"i took them out for a run and the sound cut in and out the entire run unless i help my arm completely still, but who can run like that?"
i read some reviews and people suggested to try wearing the watch on the right wrist to get it closer to the right side
ear bud.
so i tried this on the second run.
"this time, the bluetooth would completely disconnect every 5 seconds and then reconnect."
this was even worse than before.
after about 15 minutes i was ready to rip them out of my ears and toss them.
but then suddenly they connected and stayed connected the rest of the run.
i also tried using these while connected to my iphone.
trying to pair them to a second device was difficult.
i had to retry the pairing about 5 times.
following the instructions to pair didn't work every time.
"once they were paired, the sound quality was good."
but these are very unreliable and i will not be keeping them.
they are going back to amazon.
trying to workout with a cord attached to your phone is not an enjoyable experience.
"i needed a bluetooth headset, and was not going to pay over $150 for a fancy name brand.  "
it's not like i'm auditioning musicians on the treadmill and need studio quality sound.
these are pretty decent - once i figured out how to get them to stay on.  
i have teeny ears with teeny ear canals for a grown woman.  
"i can only use the very smallest silicone caps that come with this set, and i have to put the bale over my ear and then slide it back so that it really hooks behind my ear.  "
"it sometimes wants to slip out if i get icky sweaty, and today i noticed that if i walk swiftly through the gym, there is a bit of wind noise, but that could be because of my teeny ear canals.  "
i find the cord that goes behind the head to be a little stiff
", i hope it gets softer with time"
so it does not bonk out as it does now.  
the sound is very good - though i do wish it had a decibel throttle on it.  
i turned my phone on one time and nearly blew my head clean off
it was so unbelievably loud.  
it should never ever start out that loud
", i find that to be dangerous.  "
"overall, good headset for the price.  "
it comes with a nice round zipper case.  
i make sure to wipe off the entire set with one of the disinfecting cloths at the gym at the end of a workout
so they stay clean and ready for the next day.
"these are great headphones: the sound quality is very crisp and clear, and the bass is really full and powerful."
then why only three stars out of five?
"because in my opinion these headphones fail at being good sport headphones, due to the very awkward command buttons, and specifically the way to change song."
"the headphones feature only three buttons, a large one to play and pause the music, a volume-up and volume-down."
"how do you change song,"
then?you keep the volume-up/volume-down pressed for about one second.
and this is terrible.
"having to keep the hand focused near your head, with the muscles slightly in tension to keep the button pressed for an entire second (or more, in case you want to skip more than one song)"
completely disrupts the pace of your exercise.
"go on, try it."
try to stay focused on your pace when you need to keep your hand in a precise spot for about one or more seconds.
"it's very, very bad."
"the two braces to keep the earpieces in place are merely cosmetic, i didn't find them particularly effective at keeping the pieces in place."
"and it's even worse if you are biking, because the time it takes to change one song (or more, remember!)"
is time in which you don't have both hands on the handlebar.
"very bad design, a separate set of controls for skipping the music would have been better."
all in all would not buy them again.
update:
"i was contacted by a patozon representative, and was offered to try a newer model of headphones:https://www.amazon.com"
"/dp/b07c83q7qnthey work really well, and the customer support was very helpful."
got a pair of these.
"in a nutshell: bad sound, unhappy to have bought, wouldn't recommend buying."
money better spent elsewhere.
initial thoughts
": it looks swell - rather neutral, which i like."
it's very light.
pairing and operations are slick and easy.
"the build is decent - does not feel cheap; the ear loops are comfortable, even with glasses on."
but sadly that's sort of where the pros end.
"the fit was not that great - the medium buds were too big for me, and the small buds were too small."
both of them slipped out as i tried moving a bit vigorously with it - which makes it useless for the purpose i got it for - running.
"on playing some of my favorite tracks, the sound seemed well below average."
comparison: i compared it to my wired ve monks ($5+shipping) and
bose qc35
"(i know, unfair comparison, but i wanted to try it out all the same given all the positive reviews here)."
the difference in sound quality was glaring and bad!
"i'm not even going to compare it to the bose, it was bad even in comparison with the ve monks."
tested using my laptop and smartphone.
"i should put in the disclaimer that i'm not an audio engineer or an 'audiophile', just someone who likes good sounding earphones/headsets."
sound:
"the sound is very flat, and often tinny."
you can't distinguish the highs and lows.
the treble is just terrible.
"the midrange is okay, but, somehow, vocals don't sound too great."
"yes, there is bass - but, that too is bad..."
"the mid-bass is amped up, while the sub and high basses are absent."
even the presence of the mid-base does not make for good sounding lows.
"sound-stage is terrible; all the sound seems to be coming from the same place, and is hardly binaural."
instrument separation is also bad.
"overall opinion: while the build seems decent and does not feel cheap, everything else about these headsets feel very cheap."
the sound is just awful.
i'm quite unhappy
i bought this product.
i definitely would not recommend buying these.
i'd say put in a few more bucks and buy something better.

"after my initial one-star review, the customer support team contacted me and sent me a pair of mpow cheetah."
i have to say that the cheetah sounds and fits a lot better than the flame.
i'd highly recommend putting in that extra few bucks and getting the cheetah instead.
upgrading my review to 3-stars for the exceptional customer support!
update 1/4/2019:
"the seller has worked very hard to try to make this right with me, so i have updated my rating to 5 stars."
they sent me a newer model of headphones which sounded much better and do stay in the ear better.
"the style is quite different, though, and the hook is actually part of the around the head wire connecting the ear buds."
they do also sit in your ear slightly differently than the flame model.
i would recommend checking out the cheetah model to see how they look to you.
original review:
"other reviewers are correct: the ear hook does nothing, it's mostly decorative."
probably ok for around the house but not for workouts like the marketing says.
sound quality was just alright.
"bass sounded almost muffled, like listening through a cloth."
"color is far brighter and matte than what is shown in the photo, looks cheaper."
sound is also way too loud on these.
the lowest setting is still far too loud.
had to download a 3rd party app to lower the volume.
"overall this is a really nice headset, compromised only by its software stack."
"let's hope mpow will update that with a better one!the good:- deeper, richer sound than any $<30 headsets i've tried- far better microphone than most headsets"
- people
"i call report clear, good sound."
i don't normally even try to talk on headsets at this price because it's so frustrating to never know what the person on the other end of your call is hearing and isn't hearing.
"the bad: - multi-device connectivity is problematic in soooo many annoying ways: - second device will disconnect/connect at random, even at a couple of feet range, and without moving headset or device."
-
"each time that happens, the audio from your current device is interrupted by announcements."
(some headsets play those announcements over the audio but you can still hear it - this cuts out your audio altogether) -
super finicky about connecting a second device.
"sometimes it will do it, sometimes it refuses."
"and i mean, refuses, according to the ""connection refused"" status message in my mac bluetooth system preferences panel."
"if you only have one device dedicated to these, they are an exceptional deal."
i wish that the software was even close to as good as on my old mpow headset though.
they end up aggravating me as often as they delight me.
"these earphones sound good, look good and are super easy to use."
my biggest issue with them is that they are so bulky and heavy!
i have a difficult time keeping them to stay in my ear.
i’m a runner/sprinter
and it’s really annoying having to fix and readjust these earphones multiple times during my workout.
"if you are buying these earphones for regular daily use, i recommend."
"if you are a runner/sprinter, i do not recommend."
one ear stopped working after only 2.5 months.
update:
"they were kind enough to send me a different pair of earphones, once they saw that i wasn’t totally satisfied with these ones."
"the new earphones work great, but they’re not wireless."
they are noise cancellation earphones and they work extremely well for their price.
i highly recommend checking out.
update 2:
one ear stopped working after only 2.5 months.
i only ever use them to workout so
the only way i could think of them not working is due to sweat being the reason for the damage.  
"even then, they're supposed to be waterproof."
it's a let down because i actually thought the sound quality was pretty good.
redeeming qualities: great fit right out of the box and comfortable and secure.
"i was not expecting much since i've had bad luck with other ""ear loop"" style headphones"
so this was a pleasant surprise.
"genuinely decent build quality, lighter than expected, and they included foam ear pieces which seals out ambient noise exponentially better than the standard and ubiquitous silicone ones."
bt pairing and connection has so far been rock solid.
"the ugly: it had one job, to merely sound passable for my hour commute each direction, but it fails miserably."
"i wouldn't have cared if it sounded ""meh"" or even below ""meh"" or even below ""meh"" just for music and ""meh"" for low quality podcasts."
but the voicing is so completely poorly engineered.
"it has a strange, woolly character where the frequency profile sounds like they jacked up the lower mids, scooped the rest of the mids, kicked in an extra helping of sub bass, and completely cut out any high end."
it sounds like you're listening to speakers through a layer of wet cardboard.
i a/b tested with other headphones in it's price level: another cheap pair of bt earbuds this would have replaced (a generic set that's actually an old 2014/15
mpow design
"- it is highlighter green/yellow!), an over the ears cowin anc bt set (predictably bassy, scooped mids, very meh), and an old cheap wired set of panasonic buds (very clear, precise presence/silibance and mildly scooped mids)."
"let me repeat again, that i was already expecting these to not be great - they're cheap little bt buds, my standards are low!"
-
"but truly, the sound quality of these are at the level of ""emergency generic drug store buds because you're about to get on a plane for 7 hours and realized that you forgot your headphones in your other bag"" terribleness."
"i'm kind of amazed that they put so much thought and effort into the physical product, but almost comically neglected it's primary function of playing back sound."
they even sound awful for voice calls (though in fairness
the person i was talking to didn't comment on the mic's/
my voice fidelity).i should have paid the few extra dollars for those magnetic anker buds which i bought for my spouse a year ago.
"they sounded totally neutral and fine, but these mpows were on sale and i completely didn't expect the sound quality to be so unacceptably bad."
"with that said, i'm shoving them into my office desk drawer in case of emergency, but fear the day i may have to actually use them."
would love to give a positive review.
"if your phone is not in pocket, the sound quality and range is phenomenal, especially for the price point."
"unfortunately if your phone is in your pocket, these headphones are useless, the signal must be too weak to work and then audio is just a constant train"
of.broken audio.
will be returning and cant reccomend.
i like electronics.
i spend a lot of time shopping and money on things i sometimes don't need.
"however, this was one of my ""lucky"" purchases."
"i have road tested these in-ear headphones at home, work and during travel."
here are my findings.
"home: i find that the best use for these is to listen to audio material while washing the car, doing yard work, walks and general times of 'leave me alone'."
"i find that a fresh charge would outlast my longest hike through the woods, (i generally hike with only one earpiece in and the other ear is for mother nature."
work:
"i work in an office environment, and if these are on me (light or no light to indicate operation)- folks tend to buzz off."
i have also recommended this item to colleagues on numerous ocassions.
"travel: great for airport, airplane, bus, train, taxi and such to listen/ watch your own media."
"it's not gawdy, and if in the unlikely event of a theft (never happened)"
it's well within the budget to replace.
"i found that when i wear it on the plane and i wake up later, it's usually out of my ears but safely around my neck."
bonus: i can recharge this device on my portable power bank while i use the wired (backup) earbuds.
"the only fault i can find is when both buds are in, the wire around back of my neck may ""catch"" (on collar or sweaty neck) and put tension on the wire and pulls one of the 2 earbuds when i turn my head."
i think a small clip on the wire would help secure the center to a collar of clothing.
all in all
: plenty of bang for the buck.
i recommend using and testing them right away to rule out and issues while the device is in the warranty period.
happy listening.
"i really wanted to like these because i used to have a pair of mpow jaws v4.1 with the neckband, but i wanted something lighter and easier to cary around."
the battery life on these is unacceptable.  
i had these about two weeks
"and i was amazed at how quickly the battery would drain, even if i wasn't using them.  "
"i would leave the house in the morning with a full charge, then disconnect them when i got to work.  "
"at the end of the day, i would pair them up with my pixel 2 and suddenly it tells me my battery is at 30%.  "
what's worse is that five minutes later that 30% suddenly goes away and they turn off.
"so in the span of less than twelve hours, with minimal use, these can go from fully charge to shutting off.  "
i don't have time to plug these in to power several times a day just to get an hour's use out of them.  
"with my old headphones, also mpow, the battery could keep me at least a couple days."
returned.
easy to set up and use
but i was disappointed in how low and heavy everything sounds.
i adjusted my device using an equalizer
but it's still really deep sounding with too much bass.
for the price i really can't complain though.**update

8/8/2018after posting this review
the company reached out to me and sent me another style of headset.
"they are far better sounding with great crisp highs, clear mids and great lows."
they fold up easier and the stiffer material for the headband keeps them in place behind your head.
i will be recommending these to others for sure.
follow the link below for the ones i am referring to.https://www.amazon.com/dp/b013u54bfg
i returned to amazon the mpow flame after 4 hours of use.
reason: good sound
but may be health hazardous.
pro: clear and good sound.
mechanically comfortable to wear.
con:
the +/-
button layout is reversed.
the + is in the back.
the - is in the front.
the problem: this is the reason i returned it.
there is the hissing sound or low noise wave length unnoticeable hidden in the ear buds.
i felt headache and kind of vomit like after few hours listening to youtube.
i hear the hissing sound in my ears continuously for another several hours after taking the mpow off.
could not hear anything with the hissing noise for many hours after.
i have no problem of this by using the apple airpod or plantronics bluetooth headsets.
no problems with many wired ear buds.
does anyone know that if this mpow has passed any medical (health) regulation?
"i have been using these for a few days now, and at first i was a little disappointed."
"turns out, i just needed to adjust."
these things were super base heavy with all default settings on my devices.
"after a day of this, i got into the eq on my phone and it made all the difference!"
qualifier..
"my hearing is majorly jacked up, so i had to account for that."
"after the adjustment was made, these are really nice."
"they aren't studio quality by any means, but they have really good sound and great volume."
"and, they have good base."
":)they are light and attractive, they come with a nice little hard-case about the size of a cosmetic compact."
"comfort is ok, its not great, but not terrible."
i can totally tell they are there
"and i cannot leave them in for like, hours..."
but they are still very usable.
"not uncomfortable by any means, but there is no way i could forget they are in there."
"as for ambient noise, they block it very well, so these might not be good multitasking tools, but if you need to focus with some sweet buttery jams, these are a good alternative."
"over all, i would recommend these."
they are worth buying if you need a cheap set of earbuds with good sound.
these headphone have great voice clarity on calls and crisp sounding music.
the volume has a wide variance which is very nice especially in loud areas.
"the battery life is superb, i have been using them for phone calls music and audio for the past two days without a charge."
"the thing i dislike about these headphones is they pickup every sound around you, television, other conversations, etc.  "
it can make it difficult if you are talking to someone on the phone.
"overall, these seem to be a good product with some flaws, but it is hard to find quality sounds and crisp audio in an earbud in this price range, so i am overall satisfied."
i will update as time progresses.
"mpow customer service quickly contacted me about me about my dissatisfaction with their original product,  they replaced them with the mpow jaws.  "
"i do like these bluetooth head phones better, but"
"the ear pieces only have one size ear piece, which makes it rough if your ear is not shaped correctly.  "
it does not pick up background noise like the mpow flame.  
"overall, i can give a 4 star rating, for sound, quality, ease of use (excellent customer service).  "
the ear pieces interchangeability would be nice and i would give the product a 5 star rating.
i really need a new pair of wireless headphones for the gym since i crushed the last ones by accidentally stepping on them.
"these have really good sound quality, although i noticed this morning they started to making a cracking noise"
and i hadn’t even gotten a good sweat in.
they eventually stopped doing that.
i’m thinking maybe i shouldn’t wrap the wires around each other when storing them
", it could be causing the noise."
the battery life is awesome but
anything better than a 2 hours battery life from my last headphones is definitely a upgrade.
the wire that connects both headphones is a little long so sometimes when running the cord will bounce up and down on my neck.
doesn’t bother me as much anymore.  
the ear “latch” that goes over your ears is very large.
i’m just happy they added different bud sizes to the case so i could change out the original size.
i have such tiny ears!
overall not a bad buy!
anything is better than paying an arm and a leg for airpods.
they don’t even have bud size adjustment!
not everyone has the same size ears...
updated review 25 oct 18i am re-writing my original review because of the great customer service i received.
after my original review (which i stand by for the unit i purchased) this company reached out to me and said they were sending me another mpow ear buds to re-evaluate at no charge.
i was impressed and received them a week or so later.
i like free
"but if they don't perform as advertised, they would get a rating of 1 again."
"i am pleased to say that after over a month of nearly daily wear, mostly hiking about 5 miles a day, the replacement unit has not had any issues whatsoever."
"now that i can use them as planned, i want to add comments about sound, etc., that i couldn't evaluate before."
i listen to many genres of music from reggae to jazz to symphony.
"(no rap or hip-hop, thank you very much), but these old ears are pleased overall."
"i'm no audiophile who can apparently hear dog whistles, but i'm not deaf yet and these sound really good."
(think price).
i am very pleased with the customer service and the overall performance of the product.
nice to know folks stand by what they sell.
my new rating is a solid 4.................
"bobmy 1st review and low rating:great price,"
"very comfy, good sound"
so whats my beef?
they stopped pairing with all bluetooth devices after 3 uses.
what a pity because all other claims seemed true.
"maybe it's a qc thing because over 10,000 reviewers can't be wrong..."
right?i would have rated a 4 if the dang things worked properly.
i didn't rate battery life because they didn't work long enough.
"for the price point, these are some of the best wireless headphones anyone can get their hands on."
to start off-
they look great!
"in fact, they can easily be confused for power beats."
the wireless connection is pretty good
and i've never had an issue connecting via blue tooth to my phone or any problem while exercising with them.
the thing i like most about these is their noise cancellation power.
while they don't have noise cancellation in the same way a pair of bose
"do, the ear bud component fits so well in the ear, that it blocks out 99% of outside noise."
i used them to walk or run down a busy street
and i barely picked up the faint rumble of cars in the back.
and that's only when paying close attention.
"the rest of the time, the sound was fairly isolated and enhanced the quality of the music."
"having said that, i'm not sure if that has to do more with the shape of my ear canal and the bud itself, or if that's universally true for anyone."
"in any case, these come with different sized buds, so be sure to change and adjust them for best results."
"in terms of sound quality, it is decent."
"in general, and in my opinion, the sound quality compromises for a mid treble aspect instead of a powerful bass."
very middle of the road
if you know what i mean.
i'm guessing they designed them this way to adapt better to most music styles.
"lastly, the ear hooks are a bit too flimsy for my taste."
"they lack any structural rigidity or adjust-ability, so while they help secure the ear buds, they don't inspire much confidence when running/jogging and may require occasional adjustment."
"however, these are great for walking and doing just about everything."
"in conclusion, get a pair of these!!!"
"they're cheap, they look, sound, and feel good!"
"the sound quality is decent, i've loved using it for long drives."
the battery lasts as long as advertised!
it connects so easily.
"the call quality is better than my car's bluetooth, too."
however...
the call back / on / off button turned out to be the weak spot.
"after just a few months of use, they are practically unusable."
"i can't turn them off without ""last number redial"" happening first."
they often just turn on at night.
they often lose battery because of that.
"the connecting sound is so absurdly above the volume level of anything else, that going from music, to a call, back to music, results in an ear piercing sound at each step."
"the button gets stuck because, after a lot of time analyzing the issue, the physical button slides underneath the other casing part."
i am going to try their customer service to see if i just got a dud--
it has an 18 month warranty and thankfully i kept the box.
"because of the price, actual battery life, and call quality, i can live with the connecting beeps."
don’t buy these blue one!
the red ones are much better!
although (you would think)
"the only difference would be the color, the blue ones do not get anywhere nearly as loud as the red ones."
"also, on the red ones, the +/-"
button on top of the right
"ear piece allows you to adjust the audio volume, but the blue ones won’t do that."
it only changes your music to the previous or next song.
(i guess it’s
a personal preference in what feature is most important to you
"though.)the only reason i bought the blue ones is because i lost my red ones that i ordered first, and replaced them (thinking i was just getting a different color the second time)."
thank goodness
i eventually found my red ones!-------------------------------------------------update to my original review:
"after seeing that i was not satisfied with the blue pair, this seller sent me a replacement red pair free of charge and unsolicited!"
great customer service!
"thanks for keeping the satisfaction of your customers top priority!i've changed my original rating of 2 stars to 5 stars, but the rating is for the customer service and not the blue headphones."
(i still rate the blue ones  2-stars.
the red ones are 5-star)
bluetooth connection switch broke after two months of once-a-day use at the gym.
update:  
customer service was very helpful.  
they immediately contacted me and offered to replace free of charge.  
second pair seems to be working fine so far.  
time will tell.  
do appreciate the effort to make this right.  
made a note to update this review again in three months.
update 2:
customer service actually ended up sending me two replacements.
the first pair just stopped working.
went to charge it after using it at the gym for 2 hours and it wouldn’t charge.
wouldn’t reconnect to bluetooth.  
worked for about two months.
that pair of headphones now sits in my junk drawer.
the second replacement pair was damaged when it fell out of my pocket.
"i pulled my keys out, the headphones came out with them and fell on the sidewalk."
"considering these fell just a few feet from pocket height and are really light, i was surprised that the cover to the switch broke off."
it is only mechanically snapped on and one of the tabs broke off when it hit the side walk.
my fault.  
"just a fluke, although a more robust assembly system would have prevented this."
was able to get it back together using some duck tape but not sure how long it will last.
did like these headphones at this price point.
too bad about the quality issues.
just one other note.
some reviewers have commented on the stiffness of the plastic line connecting the two buds.
was a bit irksome when new
but the connection gets a lot more flexible with time.
not an issue for me.

"not bad at all for the price, i needed some cheap work headphones that i don't mind if i lose.  "
"sound quality is ok but it doesn't compare at all to higher quality headphones, but they're also < 20 bucks.  "
"i think ""noise cancelling"" may be  misleading"
", i don't notice any noise cancelling at all"
but maybe it's that they aren't nearly as good as my bose?  
i'm also not expecting good (if any) noise cancellation at this price point
so that's not why i bough them.
"my only complaint is that the volume is set too loud, i use them paired up with an iphone or ipod touch and one bar of volume is way louder than most headphones.  "
"two bars of volume is probably comparable to ~30-40% up on my bose, by the time you're a little more than halfway up on the volume bar these headphones are way louder than normal headphones turned all the way up and start distorting badly.  "
it would've been nice to have been able to fine tune the volume a little better.
edit: ended up returning for some cheap over the ear headphones from best buy.  
"again, they weren't bad headphones for the price, but i couldn't get over the volume being too loud."
"these are the 3rd pair of mpow headphones i've used (1st, mpow 059 and 2nd, mpow cheetah) and they are...a mixture of both."
"the 059's weren't my favorite because they were bass heavy, the cheetah's had great sound quality but after a year of use the connection between ear buds started to come undone and one of the buds was always being pulled out of my ear."
"so, i switched to the flame at the recommendation of a friend."
"these are definitely an improvement on the cheetahs in every way, except for audio quality."
i really need to stop getting headphones with bass boost or whatever they're calling it these days.
that extra bass really muddies the mid-range sounds.
"it would be nice if there was a switch or button to turn that bass boost on and off or maybe have two versions of the headphones, one with the boost, one without..."
but that's just me spitballing ideas out here.
these headphones pair quickly with my phone (lg g5) and have a nice long battery life.
the ear buds stay in my ear and aren't being pulled out by the loose cable - unlike the cheetahs where you could feel the self-folding connector trying to pull the ear buds back to the storage position.
the original silicone ear tips would start to hurt my ear holes after an hour or two of wear
"so i've recently (like 10 minutes ago) switched to the foam tips, we'll see if that helps."
"all things considered, these are going to become my everyday headphones despite the bass issue."
all the other positives outweigh that.
edit:  
mpow responded to my review and wanted to take care of my issue.  
they sent me the mpow cheetah bluetooth headphones that completely resolved the overpowering air sound issues.  
+1 star for mpow being awesome.
i used these i doors at my desk.
"sound quality is decent, but definitely not high end."
"for the price, i'm ok with the sound quality."
"since they are active earbuds, i used them on a 10k run."
"mostly ok, but running into the wind washed out the sound with a woooosh sound until i was around a corner and no longer going against the wind."
fast forward to mountain biking.
going on a flat surface?
woooooosh...
"is all i hear, unless i crank the volume up most of the way."
then i can mostly hear the music over the wooooosh sound.
going downhill or faster on a flat surface?
wooooooooooooooooosh!!!
"that's all i hear, with some music sometimes."
it's like they engineered these to catch any wind and amplify the sound directly toward your eardrums.
"if you're doing any activity requiring movement through air, buy some different earbuds."
"i bought these ten months ago, and i like them better than any other budget sets i've owned."
"they started cutting out a bit about four months ago when my phone would be bouncing around in my pocket during runs or what have you, and then my left headphone completely died when i was running in the rain and had only the right in my ear ("
guessing rain got into the actual earpiece and that's not waterproofed?).
"still used just the right until two days ago when they wouldn't turn on,"
i figured they'd died somehow
but they have really long battery life
and i usually know which days i need to charge them
so it came as a surprise.
"tried charging them and no luck, seems they've given up on me."
"i still liked them well enough to buy again, they pair fast and they have pretty great sound quality for the price."
"i love that i can listen to audiobooks or podcasts and use the skip forward (long press + volume button) to skip ahead thirty seconds, or skip to the next song, just having volume control would never work for long walks or runs when i'd constantly still have to use my phone."
good mic for phone calls as well.
"i'm hoping my set might not have been great given the cutting out and the life span, but maybe for the lower price lasting ten months is pretty great!"
"getting a second set now, i'll update if/when this next set has troubles."
"does not work underwater, i bought these to use for when i swim laps at the pool, but as soon as water touches them"
they go silent.
"i wasn’t expecting them to work phenomenally, but i was hoping they would work"
and they didn’t.
but as normal bluetooth headphones they work pretty decent.
edit:
so after my review i got an email from the company’s customer service team.
"they said something along the lines of sorry that the product didn’t match my expectations so we’re sending you another product, free of charge."
i received this new set of earbuds a few days later and i’m actually extremely impressed with this company.
sadly i still can’t say whether they work underwater
"but wow, that’s some customer service."
update:
6/15/19 customer service is superb.
they sent me an updated model and it is far better.
"battery life is good, it charges in 1 1/2 hours or less."
a combination of use and standby time is 12  or more hours.
i don't have a lot of use time demands.
i have one feature request that i will send them.
"i was all set to buy the 11th rated product in the category, then decided to see what the number 1 rated product was."
it was this.
the materials are excellent and the sound quality  is okay.
"the things that i don't like, that were available in the #11 rated product are;you can't use the product while it is charging."
"you have to wait the 3 or so hours for it to finish chargingi have never been able to get 9 hours of use between charges, rarely 7 hoursit"
"doesn't always automatically reconnect, i sometimes have to go through the settings to get it to reconnectit doesn't have a volume control."
if it doesn't i can't figure it
outthe
"one time i used the track control buttons, it moved up through the tracks okay but didn't move back correctly."
"so, i quit using it."
why is this one rated so high?
something fishy going on.
i wish i had bought the other one.
mpows are great headphones!
the only headphones my husband will use.
"we’ve tried beats, under armor, iso-tunes and they were good but lacked in their own way."
the main use of them is for work but he also uses them for intense workouts.
"he’s a landscaper, so he needs headphones that are sound blocking, sweat proof and durable."
these headphones do just that.
"the sound is just as clear, if not better than others."
"talking to him on the phone through these, i’ve never had an issue hearing him."
"it’s always clear unless he starts to get too far from his phone, obviously."
"others stating they are waterproof, but not like these."
"when i say we need sweatproof headphones, i mean it."
"you’d think these things got left outside in a rainstorm, that’s how hard he works."
these have stood up phenomenally!!
he soaked the beats solo 2
so we went to in ear.
he soaked the under armor twice which were rated as sweatproof if i’m not mistaken.
we tried the work rated iso tunes twice and those were good but not rated for this amount of sweat.
"the sound was poor, sound blocking was great when they stayed in the ear (sweat would mess with them) and protection was fairly good"
but it was better ear protection than headphone.
so we finally tried these after a friend recommended them to us and the only reason they have been replaced is due to misplacing them...
"at the price point, i’ll continue to replace them again with these without complaint.  "
they’ve been amazing so far and i look forward to trying the flame2 next to see if they’re an improvement of these.
these earphones work really great.
it came packaged nicely and the quality of everything that came in the box feels like good material.
"it came with its own case (which is really nice because it can be stored and carried with you in your pocket or bag, especially handy for travelling and and always flying), ear plugs, and the small, medium, and large size of ear buds that are interchangeable."
and it comes with the usb charger for the headset.
"the quality of sound is very clear, both when playing music and with calls."
"it didn't sound fuzzy or muffled on my end, and vice versa with the other line."
the controls are really easy to understandcand get the hang of.
the only downside is: it did not fit my ears.
"i have small ears, so this headset is definitely best for anyone with larger ears (primarily men)."
"i am a woman, so this product is not good for women."
"when in my ears, there is a huge gap between my cartilage/helix of my ear and the part of the earphones that should around that area to secure them in place."
"they can somewhat stay in my ears despite of the gap, but it just doesn't feel secure at all."
this is my only con of this headset.
"otherwise, it is overall a good purchase for those who have larger ears."
all i can say is wow!
i tried this style back when beats by
*
*
* first started it and back then this style was horrible.
i decided to take a chance and give it a go because of mpow
and i was impressed.
overall sound quality: 8bass:
9treble
: 9call quality:
7the sound is amazing for such a well priced set.
i've had a neckband style mpow gen 1 earbud set for 3yrs and they work beautifully.
these were a much needed step up from the previous model.
"while bass and treble we're finally tuned, call quality was also fairly decent."
"most people could not tell that i was on a bluetooth set, however, i could tell that i was listening through earbuds as some calls we're almost robotic sounding."
comfortability:
7earbud inserts: 7ear wrap wire:
7this set was a little better than ok with the ability to offer multiple earbud inserts for the ear canal.
"for me, i just couldn't find the right fit."
i think it's due to the finish of the earbuds themselves rather than my ear canal.
the earbuds almost feel as if they have a powder on them
"and no matter what size i used, if it weren't for the ear wire to wrap around my ear"
", i felt as if they were going to come out."
"speaking of the ear wrap, it's not tight and it's not loose."
it's just much too flexible.
not really a bad thing
if that's what you like
"but for me, i wanted it to be slightly more stiff to help hold the earbud in place when bending down or doing push-ups."
volume/phone call controls:these controls were perfect!
there is nothing i can say about them except to continue using these controls and do not fix what is not broken.
i'm talking to you
mpow!overall
this is a great set to have for the price.
"ultimately, i did return them as they were not a good fit for me as the neckband style earbuds that mpow offer."
there is physically nothing wrong with this set i returned.
it was not broken nor damaged when received in any way.
for me i sometimes have to work with one earbud in my ear and the other hanging off.
"because of this, these will not work."
the hanging earbud acts like a counter weight and pulls the cord and irritates the ear that the earbud is on.
for this matter i cannot use these and have switched to mpows neck band style earbuds which work great!
they sound good and paired easily.
my complaint is that the ear hooks are far too flexible.
"they work fine if you're sitting still listening to music, but seeing that this is advertised for use in jogging and other exercise, there's no way they'll stay in place without wrapping a headband around your ears."
"they don't fall off completely, but they move far enough from my ear that i have to keep pushing them back into place."
"update part 2 - when i posted my negative review, they reached out and sent a new pair."
that pair also won’t turn on or charge either - and
this time it was less than a month.  
not impressed.
you get what you pay for.
update
part
1-
"after posting this ad, they reached out directly and without even asking, sent me a new pair."
that's damn good customer service.
so i've adjusted my review.
"will keep you updated!!original review - let me first say, i loved these babies for the price."
"i ran with them a lot, sweated on them, and the battery life was extremely impressive."
"sound quality wasn't the most amazing, but for the price it was all pretty great"
got the job done..
"but now seven months later, they died on me."
"started beeping- won't re-sync, or stay on, and now won't even take a charge."
i've tried multiple usb cords...  bummer.  
"would have liked at least a year, but for $20 wireless buds, you get what you pay for."
"i have used several brands and types if bluetooth headsets, and this is one of my current favorites."
my favorite thing about this set is that it is excellent for phone calls.
"several other bluetooth headsets i've had did not have a good mic, and"
"people i talked to complained about background noise, but with this set, the sound is clear."
the thing i like least about this set is that the battery life is not great.
i have to recharge frequently.
i've had several other sets with batteries that would last so much longer.
"my primary uses for this set are listening to audibooks, podcasts, and music, and occasionally taking a phone call."
"because i often listen while momming, i typically have only one earbud in."
it's not as easy to do that with this set as with one that has a structured neck band.
"the free headphone drags downwards, pulling on the one in my ear."
i sometimes will use the ear clip to hood the free headphone to my shirt to keep it from pulling.
i must be one of those people that have issues with headphones and ear phones because i can't seem to keep them in my ears when i work out (running and cycling indoors).
"however, these headphones stay on thanks to the loop around the ears."
and they sound great!
so far i've used them for 6 hours and the battery level is still over 50%.
i would invest in three of these over the jabra active 65t that i bought... and they would still be cheaper and stay on.
i've always had problems with headphones that go in the ear since the ear canal in my right ear is a little smaller.
but with using the squishy attachments it comes with i can wear them a lot longer than other in ear headphones.
"still have to adjust them after a while, but much better what i've had to go through in the past."
"bluetooth is great, so no chords."
"and seemingly secure, although haven't done extensive running with them in yet."
cons: with using the squishy ear attachments the sound quality drops a little since i assume they're more for bass quality
and they sometimes try to push out of the ear if you don't ne secure them well enough.
"still some discomfort after a while around the ear, but everyone different."
if you can secure the wire around the head so it doesn't bounce while you run them that would be better too.
"using it for music, movies, and youtube on your phone is really good overall."
phone quality isn't bad either.
i hear them perfectly
", only has one person say they couldn't hear me talking while using bluetooth."
"overall: try them out, give them a chance."
they're not expensive and can really surprise you.
i'm definitely content with my purchase.
update 31 jul 19:
tried out few more ear buds including galaxy iconx.
these are still my go-to.
"they've never fallen out, always been comfortable in the ear, and have ran in the rain with them."
i'm returning the galaxy iconx.
disconnects it self from bluetooth repeatedly.
"i've tried using it on my samsung ph, fire kindle, apple ipad, samsung tablet and my iphone..."
it's a piece of junk!updated review: after leaving a review for this product the company sent me out a new pair of headphones.
"i didn't even know that the company was going to send me out a new pair, it was definitely a nice surprise.  "
the second pair seems to hold a connection to my bluetooth much better but only time will tell.
as of right now i am happier with the second product that arrived in the mail.
i work outside almost every day and they have been rained on and i once took a shower with them just to test them out.  
they kept ticking.  
the sound quality for audio books has been fine.  
i do have 3 dislikes
but they aren't major.1.
the wire connecting the earbuds is just a hair short to for me to go around the back of my neck.  
"not just sitting stationary, but when working it just grabs the skin on my neck and creates an uncomfortable tug."
it looks silly
but i end up working all day with the cord up front to avoid the issue.2.  
"the battery,  throughout the day-"
i turn it off and on and it always shows high battery life on the phone.  
"when it does go out it says ""low battery"" and that's it.  "
you have about 5 minutes or less.  
it does seem to last about 7-9 hours depending on volume i suppose.  
(side note-
nobody has asked if i was on a bluetooth).3.  
"also minor, it says the phone number not the name of who is calling."
i can see maybe some would call this a bad review.  
it isn't.  
keep in mind the price!  
they seem to be well made and as someone who is hard on thier things a cheaper made product would have broken by now (about a month).
sound is good.
pairing easy.
good packaging and additional ear plug sizes.
fit is not snug.
"once i get the position set, the ear loop is not snug enough to keep in place."
the weight causes them to start sagging and eventually falling off.
i have to twist/rotate to get the ear loop snug around the ear.
the rotation then causes the ear plug to be out of position.
might work better for larger ears.
"however, i don’t consider my ears to be small."
update:
customer service reached out to me immediately and offered options to remedy the issue with the flame model.
they have been in touch twice and sent replacements.
they are on top of things.
you can’t complain when the seller is involved immediately.
few products will ever be perfect.
what matters is whether the customer support is there after the sale.
in this case they exceeded my expectations

bought these a little over a month ago.
"the audio quality is decent not great, which is to be expected for the price."
the bluetooth antenna is pretty horrible as well.
i've done a few test with the bluetooth range and i can get them to work fine 15-20 ft.
that is unless there is a door/wall obstructing you and the bluetooth device you're connected with.
if you have your bluetooth device on you at all times there doesn't seem to be an issue.
the battery life in incredibly bad.
they don't seem to hold the charge.
at best i can get them to last 2-3 hours in comparison to the 7-9 hours which the product advertises.
they start to die out after 3-4 weeks.
"as for comfort, they feel awkward in the ear and don't stay in place when doing strenuous activities."
if you're going to jog with these you are going to have constant bumping and adjusting in your ears.
my advice would be to look for another pair of bt headphones.
you can find better bluetooth headphones for the same price out there.
you get what you pay for and for the price this is a great deal.
headset sounds great while using the memory foam ear bud pads.
one major downfall is the battery life....
"and as a frequent podcast and music listener hearing "" low battery"" in my head every 20 seconds is a dumb ""feature""."
there's already an indicator on my phone for bluetooth device power.
why that recording was added to playback is silly.
the most i get is 4hrs on full charge.
which may be enough for most.
not for me.
in had a pair of beats 3 and loved them...
but the poor build quality won't bring me back to buy another pair.
these will do till i find something
better.---update
: the company has amazing customer service.
"without my concern or demand, they sent out a replacement pair of earbuds"
"and i have to report, after a week or two, the battery life is significantly improved."
the firmware needs work.
i don't feel the vocal instructions do much other than to annoy and take up unnecessary time.
"lines like ""the device is connected,"" ""device is powered off,"" etc... it adds nothing."
"with my android phone, i get those notifications just fine."
"these headphones really don't need a low fidelity scratchy recording telling you what your own actions, and connected devices already display."
"i know it's on, and i know it's connected."
"otherwise, good price, good headset."
*
*update*
* roughly six months of use (nothing strenuous) and suddenly the left earbud stopped producing sound.
wiggling wire causes static but the wire itself is not visibly damaged.  
unsure of this is due to sweat or moisture getting into the device despite its water resistance.. will see if the 18 month warranty holds up*****second time buying an mpow product.
i will admit i was very nervous about these at first.
"however, i was very pleasantly surprised at how well balanced they are....  "
especially for bluetooth ear buds.!!
they fit snugly and sound amazing.  
great lows/
bass which is hard for many ear buds to push through.
unsure about the noise cancellation
but it does help reduce the amount of ambient noise around you whil e still letting in enough
"so you know what's going on.overall, very impressed with this product."
these were okay bluetooth earbuds for the price.  
"i used them at work, and when doing things around the house, mostly mowing the lawn.  "
i even took a couple airplane trips using these.  
"after a year, the left earbud stopped working.  "
"this is probably user derived wear and tear, but i can't recall any times where i snagged the small cord connecting the earbuds."
"when using these for calls, everyone sounded like i was far away from the microphone or under water.  "
a coworker has a similar pair of and has the same experience.  
"the sound usually needed to be all the way up on my device (phone, laptop, tablet) and the earbuds were almost maxed out to hear audio.  "
pairing was pretty straight forward.
"these were supposed to be nose cancelling, but i couldn't tell any difference."
i bought two pairs of these headphones.
the ones in the picture is the second pair i bought for myself after my daughter told me she liked the pair i bought for her.
the overall comfort and utility of these headphones is good.
"they connect quickly, don't chafe the ears much, and the battery lasts as expected."
"unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the quality."
both pairs died within a few days of each other.
one pair could no longer be charged or turned on anymore after just 11 months of use.
"the second pair started to physically fall apart after 4 months of light use while i was on a walk, so the lost part can't be recovered as can be seen in the picture."
update:  
"i wasn't able to make contact right away as email bounced, but once i was able to get hold of mpow support they responded quickly and sent me replacements for defective units."
the replacements are working perfectly.
i am very pleased with the quick response and prompt support.
they look better than they sound.
good thing i bought these as a back up.
i hope i never have to wear them.
the sound quality is quite inferior compared to the other brand i bought these to backup.
the above was my initial review.
i have since changed my 3 star review to a 5 star one.
their customer service is outstanding!
after posting this review they contacted me to tell me they were sending me a more recent version of these headphones free of charge.
they arrived today...
"and wow,"
"wow,"
wow!
they are amazing!!!
sound quality is better than the initial pair i had gotten these to backup!!!
needless to say i immediately bought a second pair a few minutes ago.  
what an amazing improvement!!
"clean, clear, crisp sound without that annoying rattling bass sound."
love them!!!
pros:
packaging is nicepaired
"easilythe carrying case is very nicecons:don't plug my ears, with any of the included tips or my ownno noise cancelling, since they don't actually plug my earssound quality is awfulmaterials are cheapi bought these to replace a pair of jbls that i hate for their controls."
"i suppose it's pretty silly to expect a pair of $20 headphones to measure up, but they came highly recommended from some friends."
"(i am now reconsidering these friendships.)they're made of very cheap, flimsy plastic."
"they have a hook, but the way it's positioned, it doesn't actually hook over your ear if you have the bud in your ear canal."
"other headphones of this style will have a little pad behind the bud itself, to help it fit and block noise; on these, it's a bit of hard plastic."
it might as well not be there.
"but what matters is the sound, and these are so bad."
"they could charitably be called bass heavy, but a better description would be muddy."
"start some music on your phone, then stick it under your pillow."
that's what they sound like.
i got physically angry listening to them.
instant return.
don't make my mistake.
these headphones are a great value for their price.
"especially good for young kids, who regularly destroy things."
"with my type of ussage, i can go two, three days between charges."
"however, the main issue for me is the connecting wire."
its too short and the rubber too sticky.
"during regular use, and not at the gym, the wire will stick to the back of my neck and remove an earbud from my ear if i were to turn my head."
"given the over-ear clasps, i didn't think that was possible."
it is.
i'm not a big guy with a fat neck or anything like that either.
"if i were to wear them with the wire under my chin, instead behind my neck, the wire curls in a loop and rests under my chin, making something that looks goofy look ridiculous."
the wire needs to be about 3 inches longer and made from a less-abrasive rubber.
"i know the set is not meant to be noise-canceling, but they wouldn't even come close if they were to be."
"ifyou're like me, and aim to drown out the awful music they play at the gym, this set won't help, even with the volume at full blast."
"still, the price is very good."
i am not going to pay $100.00+ for a set of earbuds from anyone.
highly recommended.
"they are okay, i didnt find them comfortable."
"didn’t fit around my ears that well and would fall out, then when i push them back into my ear i would accidentally hit the one button on the side."
"another note is the sound quality, not bad but not great, the bass is too high which muffles the high and mids, not great for podcasts or something where people are speaking like an audio book."
"anyways i have shelved these headphones in favor of another pair, but hey for $20 you get what you pay for,update:"
"their customer service reached out to me and sent a free pair of a different style of headphones, while the new pair is also about the same quality and even less comfortable, i am upping my stars from 3 to 4 because of the excellent customer service in an attempt to get me satisfied with the product."
very rarely does a seller on amazon reach out like this.
pros: i ordered this headset a little over a year ago
and i'm so incredibly impressed with it.
i have fairly small ears (both the opening and the ear itself)
and i've never experienced discomfort using them.
"if i even remotely think i will, i often don't loop it around my ear and they still stay snug."
next the sound is spectacular.
it is rich and clear.
"i don't play my music too loud and even when it is on a relatively low volume level, it cancels out excess noise and helps you better appreciate your music (or audiobooks/podcasts, etc)."
"the battery also lasts forever, around 6-8hrs depending on the volume i listen at."
i purchased the red/black pair for myself and it doesn't get dirty and isn't too heavy.
i loved these so much i bought the black pair for my boyfriend!cons: i waited to write a review to be able to comment on the lasting quality of the headset.
"i take very good care of them and always put them in the case to transport and never used in ""wet"" conditions, nor did i blast the volume or abuse them."
however i noticed a few months ago that they started to sound more faint in my left ear.
i often wore these at work because they are more discreet and connect from so far away.
"due to that, i would wear one at a time and didn't notice the extent of the sound diminishing."
now the left speaker doesn't play at all but some occasional crackle of what should be my music.
the right side still works perfectly and all the buttons are completely functional.
naturally i am very disappointed as i wanted them to last longer than a year.
i would definitely consider purchasing again if they lasted longer.
i can't imagine if they would last as long for someone who was rough with them.
i couldn't recommend these more.
i listen to my headphones a lot.
"at least 3-4 hours a day, and sometimes more."
"i usually listen through my phone, which does not have a headphone port, so it's important to me that i have a reliable pair of bluetooth headphones on hand."
i couldn't be happier with these.
upon opening the box it is immediately apparent that these are well made.
nothing about the construction of these headphones says $20.
"the build is solid, and they look and feel like a quality item."
the sound is quite good as well.
"your not going to confuse them with a $200 pair of high end headphones or anything, but your average listener will be quite staisfied."
"a little distortion if you go crazy bass heavy with them, but overall they sound as good or better than any other pair of lower priced headphones i've ever bought, and better than a lot of other similarly priced options."
the battery life is fantastic too.
i've bought bluetooth headphones in the past that were advertised to have similar battery life
and i wound up being incredibly disappointed.
if i can't get at least 4-5 hours out of a charge they're of no use to me.
not a problem here.
"i've run them for 5-6 hours between charges, and have yet to have them die on me."
"obviously, since i just received them last week i can't make any claims to their durability, however, if my current experiences with them are any indication i'll be pretty shocked if i don't get a pretty solid life out of them."
i'll update again in a few months on that topic.
"i'm quite hard on my headphones, so if they last me they'll last anyone."
overall i can't imagine getting more for my money.
"everything works as advertised, and works very well."
i couldn't recommend these more.
i listen to my headphones a lot.
"at least 3-4 hours a day, and sometimes more."
"i usually listen through my phone, which does not have a headphone port, so it's important to me that i have a reliable pair of bluetooth headphones on hand."
i couldn't be happier with these.
upon opening the box it is immediately apparent that these are well made.
nothing about the construction of these headphones says $20.
"the build is solid, and they look and feel like a quality item."
the sound is quite good as well.
"your not going to confuse them with a $200 pair of high end headphones or anything, but your average listener will be quite staisfied."
"a little distortion if you go crazy bass heavy with them, but overall they sound as good or better than any other pair of lower priced headphones i've ever bought, and better than a lot of other similarly priced options."
the battery life is fantastic too.
i've bought bluetooth headphones in the past that were advertised to have similar battery life
and i wound up being incredibly disappointed.
if i can't get at least 4-5 hours out of a charge they're of no use to me.
not a problem here.
"i've run them for 5-6 hours between charges, and have yet to have them die on me."
"obviously, since i just received them last week i can't make any claims to their durability, however, if my current experiences with them are any indication i'll be pretty shocked if i don't get a pretty solid life out of them."
i'll update again in a few months on that topic.
"i'm quite hard on my headphones, so if they last me they'll last anyone."
overall i can't imagine getting more for my money.
"everything works as advertised, and works very well."
for a cheap pair of headphones these are a great value.
build quality is plastic
"but it’s well made, they fit well and are secure."
the feature set is good.
water resistant and bluetooth wireless audio
"they are perfectly adequate cheap headphones, but they don’t sound spectacular as so many reviews claim."
"they are good headphones, but not great."
the sound lacks that “spacious” and full quality that you get with better headphones.
you need to turn the volume up a lot in order for these to sound good.
"on higher end headphones, even at lower volumes the sound is full and immersive."
not to say that these aren’t good.
for most people this is probably going to be a great choice.
what it boils down to is this.
"if you want a pair of cheap headphones that are great for wet environments and you’re not afraid to lose, these are great."
"but if you care a lot about audio quality, skip these and spend some more on something better.  "
"that said, for $20"
"i’m keeping these, but i’ll probably save up for a better pair in the future."
"a major problem i had with ear buds is they would fall out of my ear when i would go to the gym, run, or do outdoor activities."
the hooks that fit over your ear prevent this from happening.
they fit snugly and comfortably in your ear.
"the battery life has never been an issue, but i do charge it after every few times of using it."
you're not going to get the greatest sound quality out of these but for the price i would say it's above average.
"the ipx7 means it's protected against heavy rain and splashing, so you don't have to worry about having the headphones damaged if you get it wet."
it just cannot be submerged.
also make sure the flap which protects the charging port is closed.
it does use micro-usb to charge.
highly recommended if you're looking for a cheap set of headphones for doing physical outdoor activities.
"so i posted a review of these bluetooth earbuds around a week and a half back, to which i stated my enjoyment of the pair before they cut out to the point of not being usable or being able to charge them."
"however, the seller patozon reached out to me and sent me a second pair to see if my opinion would change, and guess what?"
"it did, to a certain extent."
i loved the ones i purchased the only problem
was i wasn't aware of some issues that other people had which included
said cutouts.
"so now that i have a new working pair, my cross country runs finally have that rich and balanced sound that i missed."
these earbuds offer some decent bass while not overpowering like some of the beats by dre products that run over 100$. keep in mind
these things are 20
$!
"the mids and highs do compliment the as stated before strong low end for more intense workouts since even audiophiles will forget about a lot of the detail when they're sweating off gallons of fluid, speaking of which, these are ipx7 sweat/waterproof"
"so you can take these on a run like me or to the gym, and they'll work like a charm."
they come with some accessories such as multiple interchangeable ear tips to compliment different ear sizes
[the default ones worked fine for me] that are extremely comfortable and snug so they do not fall out.
"you'll get a micro usb cable to charge it since that is a popular interface, chances are you have another cable laying around to replace it since the cable is quite short."
"all of these come in a compact and tough carrying case that you can fit in your pocket with no problem, and is padded for your earbuds protection."
"pairing these are easy, just hold down the big red ""mpow"" logo for a few seconds and you are ready to pair it with your phone."
"the battery lasts around 6-8 hours on a single charge, and since it has a sleep mode, you can use these multiple times throughout the day or even week on just a single 1 1/2 hour charge."
the only drawbacks i could find was one time i could not pair them until i forgot the device and redid the connection.
"also since i was sent the second one i also wish someone told me the first time that you can not let these things die, since that if you do, they will not come back."
"those were complaints about an older model that seemed to boil over into this one, but always keep them charged, and you will be good to go."
"but, at the end of the day, these things are pretty incredible and was complimented by a seller that was very mature and genuine in their response to my first review of this product."
"thanks go out to patozon and mpow for giving me this chance to review this product, that really left me impressed."
"i use these every day, sometimes for a couple of hours, sometimes longer.  "
"they've been perfectly fine for standing or sitting at work and, uh, well, working.  "
"the sound is very good, especially for $20 (amazon actually gave me mine for free when their c.s. rep cancelled my order after saying she would expedite my delivery...."
very confusing.)they have been great.  
"i like the sound quality, the bass isn't overwhelming.  "
"it doesn't appear to have noise-cancelling, but i'm at work, so i really shouldn't have that anyway."
"they do seem to make my ear jut out a bit, so there is a little bit of soreness after wearing for 3-4 hours.  "
"connecting can be a bit tricky sometimes, just make sure you disconnect from one source (like a computer) before trying to connect to another (like a phone).  "
battery longevity is much better than my previous bluetooth headset.  
: )  yay!
they sound excellent.
i’m amazed that they sound this good for such a little amount of money.
the only problem in having is that the war piece is a little bit too big for me
"but they do keep them from falling off, just keep having to readjust them for a tight fit."
next time i’ll order them without the thing that goes around my ears.
i also have bode true wireless earbuds
and i like the sound of these just as much if not more.
"let’s put it this way, i don’t use the bose anymore and wish i had found out about these first because i never would have waisted my money on the really expensive ones."
i want to order the true wireless ones of the mpows
but i cannot afford anymore money right now for earbuds with the bose just sitting there.
"great job mpow, and thank you amazon for offering such a great quality and yet affordable product!!!!"
"the sound quality is really good, and the buds block out quite a bit of outside noise."
it has a long battery life and it's really easy to connect between my phone and laptop.
"it also came with extra bud tips and a nifty case that i can carry my usb sticks with, along with the earbuds and charging chord."
the only thing i don't like about it is how chunky they are.
the curvy piece doesn't really seem to have a function other than aesthetics.
they've fallen out of my ear once because i didn't push them in all the way
"(i was talking to someone) and the curvy piece didnt catch on my ear,"
"like i thought it was supposed to do?overall, these are great quality for what i paid (~$15)."
but i can't get myself to do so.  
"my ears are a bit on the small side, and the ear hooks seem to hover above my ears instead of resting on them.  "
"also, i thought the band that connects these wouldn't bother me that much, but it seems to get hooked on the back of my shirt every time i move my head."
"but, enough on the overall downsides as the audio is pretty good for the price you pay.  "
"for one, they are loud!  "
"i only place the volume up a fraction to what they can go to, and they audio is plenty loud."
"also, the bass is pretty deep.  "
"can be a tad muddy, but if your phone has an equalizer you can remedy this."
"again, i really wish these fit better since the sound is good for the price.  "
"but, i'll probably go back to the stock wired earbuds that came with my s10+i've"
"also heard some people getting a free upgrade to the newer model of this headset, so maybe i'll look into that."
am working up to a good review.
but it will take more time to cover all that would comprise an excellent one.  
one question that can only be answered by time is how long will they continue to work?  
"compared to my airpods, the sound quality is good, but not great.  "
but that wasn't why i bought the mpow cheetah.
problem with the apple air pods is that they don't stay in the ear.  
i use them with trepidation of their falling out of my ears to become lost  the mpow cheetah's fit comfortably and securely.
that is a very big thing.  
i do have some minor quibbles:  
"mine came without a case to store and charge them in; and, i would like a more robust sound.  "
"but for the price and the very real sense of security i feel with them,  they are hard to beat."
"at first these headphones were great, they were easy to use, the sound was good, and i was happy with everything."
"however, not only is it hard to tell how much battery is left until a voice starts yelling about low power (my phone display always showed either 100%, 90%, or 70%, nothing lower), and"
"then not even three weeks after getting them, the left side stopped working completely."
"there was no physical damage at all, and i tried turning them off and on several times, nothing worked."
"never getting this brand again, super disappointed."
these headphones are very comfortable and easy to wear for long periods of time.
"the over-ear design keeps them solidly in place during activity, but is barely noticeable."
"the wire won't win any fashion awards, but it guarantees consistent sound quality of both earbuds, which is not true of many totally wireless earbuds, where earbuds can go out of sync with each other."
"unfortunately, they do sound quite tinny."
"bass response is noticeably lacking, particularly when playing music."
these might work just fine for some light podcasts.
"if you are an audiophile looking to groove to some deep funky bass, you probably don't want to go anywhere near these headphones."
"you might claim that you shouldn't expect much for 20 bucks, but there are plenty of headphones near the same price range that sound far better."
updated review:  
"after contacting customer support, they supplied me with a new headset and it works great.  "
i'm able to walk the complete length of the pool without losing audio.  
their customer support is fantastic.  
they were most helpful and didn't hesitate to send me a new headset.
previous review:  
"although advertised at 33 feet, i cannot get more than 5 feet from my ipad mini without it breaking up.  "
my reason for purchasing this product is so i can listen to audio books while exercising in the pool.  
"the sound quality is fine for books, the headset is comfortable and the noise canceling does work.  "
"with my maze h20 headset, i could leave the ipad on the patio table and walk up and down the length of the pool.  "
"with this headset, i could not go more than 5' without the audio breaking up.  "
"that's unfortunate, because it defeats the purpose.  "
"i will keep them for air travel, they work fine as long as the ipad is close by."
update:
i purchased these in april.
"as of today (october 27, 2019), they no longer work."
they will no longer turn on and will not charge.
i cannot find a way to contact the seller regarding the warranty.
very disappointed.
"i needed some new headphones because my other ones, with a cord, broke."
i decided to get some bluetooth ones and these seemed to have a good rating.
"the quality of sound is good, it is clear and it cancels noise."
i do not have to turn the volume up high in order to clearly hear my books.
"one thing that happens, every once in a while, is the bluetooth seems to go out if i turn my head and the connection crackles."
"also, the fit of the pieces over the ears it a bit wonky."
"overall, however, i think they are a great pair of headphones and would purchase them again."
i've had this headset for a little more than a month.
in the beginning it worked great.
i previously owned the bose sport
headset
so i was really impressed with the quality and audio.
i charged it yesterday before going to the gym but after a few mins of using it
"i heard the ""battery low"" warning."
i though i didnt charge it correctly.
"but today i had the headset charging like i usually do while i settle in at work, it was charging for a full hour"
"but i am still hearing the ""low battery"" warning."
i was really hopeful with this headset.
update:
the company sent me a brand new headset right away.
"works great now, with no complaints."
i’m so happy they exchanged it without any issues and that i can listen to my music without having to get tangled up in a cord
i did have trouble pairing these headphones to different devices.
the instructions that come with these headphones leave a lot to be desired.
"so, through a lot of trial and error, i was able to figure out why i was unable to pair these headphones."
"first of all, you need to know what the blue and red lights mean."
"when just blue is flashing, that means you are paired."
"when the red and blue lights are flashing, that means the headphones are in pairing mode."
"so, this is what happened to me..."
"according to the included directions, to put the headphones into pairing mode you must depress the button on the side of the headphone for around 3 - 4 seconds."
"when you do this, you will see the red and blue lights flashing"
but you can only get those two lights to flash red and blue if you haven't paired them to another device that's in close proximity to the device your trying to pair.
i first paired my headphones to my cell phone.
no problemo.
then i attempted to pair them to my computer.
i couldn't get the headphones to flash red and blue.
it just flashed blue.
i didn't know why it was just flashing blue until i did some research and found out that flashing blue means it's paired to a device.
"in my case, it was my phone."
"i turned bluetooth off on my phone and, voila!"
the headphones flashed red and blue and i was able to pair them with my computer.
"then when i tried to pair the headphones with my amazon dot, i had to turn bluetooth off on my phone and my computer before i could get the lights to flash red and blue."
"when i did that, i was able to pair the headphones to my dot."
"now, if i want to use my headphones on one of my devices, i must turn bluetooth off on all the other devices."
i love the way these headphones feel when i'm wearing them.
they feel very comfortable and nice and snug in my ears and the sound is great!
i would recommend these
but you need to know how to pair them
so i hope my instructions prove helpful.
i bought a set of these back in april to use when exercising/working out
and they suddenly just working a few days ago.  
"wouldn’t turn on or charge, so i just bought a second pair despite a few gripes i had with the first pair – including that they stopped working after 7 months."
"first, the sound quality wasn’t what i expected from reading the reviews."
"the sound (especially voices when streaming new/npr/talk radio, etc.) seemed a bit muffled and distorted."
i also couldn’t use them for voice calls while on long bike rides (something i do a lot to multitasking while getting in my exercise) because they seem to pick up all the wind noise so no one could hear me clearly.
"when i was sitting still or just walking, voice calls were ok, but if i needed to talk while riding, i’d have to wear my apple wired headphones which don’t seem to have that problem."
(i suspect this has something to do with the placement of the microphone being on the very front of the mpows
so the wind hits them directly
"while cycling forward, but not sure.)the biggest plus for these (and why i bought a second pair) was that they actually stayed in my ears and were comfortable no matter what i was doing at the gym and elsewhere."
"no matter how much better the sound quality might be on more expensive pairs, they are of little use to me if they won’t stay in my ears when doing what i bought them for."
every other style i’d tried would fall out of my ears or require constant readjustment which was super annoying.
"if i wanted better sound quality and would not be moving around, i just wore other headphones."
what i didn’t really realize until they broke was how dependent on them i’d become.  
it only took one day at the gym wearing my wired apple headphones again to remind me how annoying it was to have wires in the way and have them falling out even with the rubber ear hooks i bought to help keep them in.
"so despite my disappointment that they broke in 7 months and some of my other gripes with the first pair, i ordered another pair, and this pair actually seems better."
the sound quality is much clearer with no distortion.
(maybe my first pair was just a dud?)  
"still can’t wear them for voice calls on bike rides, but i can live with that."
"so overall, i’m happy with them - especially the second pair still a little disappointed"
"i had to buy another pair after 7 months, but enjoying the better sound quality of the 2nd pair."
"this is currently the number one set of bluetooth in-ear headphones on amazon, so i took a chance.  "
"i'm not crazy about the fit, and the cord is stiff--resulting in pulling on one side more than the other.  "
the primary reason i went with this model vs. models that have weight asymmetry due to the battery and mic being on the right side under the earpiece was that i wanted no tugging on my ears.  
"well after a half-a-dozen trips to the gym and jogs, it still happens because of the strange stiffness in the plastic cord!!!"
note the bass isn't bad so long as the fit is tight in the ear canal.
i want a good $35-$50 wireless pair with no connection between the ears--that sound good and lasts 4-6hr/charge.
is that so much to ask?  
"if you've found them, please let me know.update:  "
mpow reached out and sent a replacement set of headphones.  
i like them much better
(model s2)
and the cord is a bit softer.
update part 2:
contacted the manufacturer because i read these headphones have an 18 month warranty.
"after being instructed to try a few troubleshooting techniques, they determined that they would replace my headset with another pair for free!"
great customer service!update:
"less than a year after purchasing, they seem to have short circuited."
"after a very difficult p90x workout where they got drenched in sweat, i wiped them down and plugged them in to charge."
"after a few minutes, the red charging light turned off and they would not turn on anymore."
so much for being waterproofprevious
: i waited on this review for a while because i really wanted to experience what these headphones will do.
"after this time, i am very happy with this product."
i didn't even know it had a microphone...
not a very good one hence the 4 stars but
"the function of these headphones have definitely proved their worth, especially at the gym and at work when sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours."
these are pretty good headphones for the price.
i’ve had them for a few months now
and they are still working fine.
the sound quality isn’t bad and with the different
ear tips
i was able to choose a size that was comfortable.
they aren’t noise cancelling which wasn’t something i was worried about.
they stay in pretty well through most workouts.
"i have relatively small ears and it takes some adjustment to get them to stay in during the most intense workouts with lots of fast movement, and there is a bit of a wind sound while sprinting, but in every other way they seem to work fine."
they are very easy to use and pair quickly.
"i don’t know how they compare to the other one’s that look pretty much identical, but at $20 they are not much of a risk."
i have tested this product in several ways.  
waterproofing easily survives showers and rain weather.  
if the sound quality is lower afterwards all you need to do is remove the price that goes into your ear and dry off the water on the speaker.  
battery life is good for me.  
lasts for at least 8 hours of being used for me.  
charging time seems to be about an hour.  
sound quality is great for the price.  
the fact that it comes with a case is cool
but i find i just keep them around my neck most of the time.  
they also stay on easily while jogging.  
"i like the foam price better than the gel,  "
feels more comfortable personally.  
the price that goes around the ear seems to be like a hardened rubber.  
the fact that it can shift around while staying in the ear is great.  
doesn't get uncomfortable easily and makes it way harder to break.  
the only issue i've had is the cord that goes around the neck can sometimes stick depending on how sweaty you are
and then if you turn your head it will yank a bit.
ugh.
wish i'd listened to the negative reviews.
these do have a tinny sound quality
but it's what i was expecting given the price.
"they worked fine for 4 months, then one day while i was listening to music they suddenly disconnected from my phone, and refused to pair again."
"i tried everything i could find online to get them to pair again, with no luck."
"i contacted mpow and they told me i was sol because i didn't buy them from the seller ""patozon""."
instead i'd bought them from
"amazon.com services, inc in condition ""used - like new - item will come in original packaging."
"packaging will be damaged."", and at the time i'd felt confident doing so because i trust amazon to check their products."
"so great, i sat there for 3 months with a worthless pair of headphones in my desk drawer and a company not willing to take responsibility for their own defective product."
every week or so i'd take them out and try to pair them again with no luck.
"today, after writing a 1 star review, i took them out for the hundredth time and after a few minutes of trying the same things i'd tried every other time, they decided to pair."
i have no idea
"why, or how,"
but i bumped up my 1 star review to 2 stars since - for the moment - they are working again.
maybe they'll never stop pairing again....
but i'm not holding my breath.
i actually purchased these because of a youtuber named greggles.
"i dunno if i got a dud or what, but the sound quality is not at all where it should be."
"loud maybe, but not good."
"i used them for exactly one shift at work, and then i put them on my bookshelf."
"they are much better priced than most blutooth wireless sets, so this is what i was looking for when i saw them."
go with a more expensive set.
"these are not even worth the $22!along with the terrible tinny sound quality, they are bulky at your ears."
"they do stay put, but it is uncomfortable cause there is a big bar at your ear."
"i tried to go with a product that saved me money, but i do not care for them at all."
order came quickly.
"neatly packaged, very high end looking."
"for, for me, is great."
"i typically can't get earbuds to stay in my ears, these do."
"sounds is very good for $20 earbuds, definitely better than the last pair of no-name earbuds that i had."
the base is definitely more than other earbuds that i've used.
build quality seems to be very well.
they look nice and seem to have a solid construction.
i can vouch for their waterproofness as i recently put them in the washing machine for about 15 minutes before i realized they were in there.
i took them when i realized it and towel dried them off.
i decided to see if they would still work and test if the water rating is good.
"they started up without issue, sounded great, and charged up without any problems."
definitely a great set of wireless earbuds.
"i would definitely recommend, it for twenty bucks, it's a hard deal to beat!"
so far i am really enjoying these headphones.
they sound pretty good for being ~$20.
"they are very bass heavy (if you are into that), so i ended up turning the bass down on the profile i made for these on my phone."
there isn't much of a tinny sound with these which is great.
"overall, i would say the sound on these are really good for the price."
they are comfortable to wear.
"they give you several different tip sizes, so it is easy to find the right one for you."
"they have a plastic thing that goes behind your ear to help keep them in, and that does not bother me."
the only bad thing is that you can't adjust the angle (up/down) of the plastic piece that goes behind your ear.
meaning: i need the actual earbuds to turn up to create a nice seal.
"instead of twisting the earbuds up and keeping the plastic thing behind my ear still, i have to turn the entire headset, earbud and plastic."
"not a super big deal, but can get annoying, as it would probably have to be adjusted less if they moved independently."
"(although, that would probably be an area of breakage, and would make the headphones less desirable)"
"again, not a big deal."
just the only thing i can really think to nitpick.
connecting to my phone or computer with these is nearly instant when i turn them on.
bonus points for that!
"i have noticed, that the rang in my house is not the best (which is to be expected with walls and doors and such)."
"i have even noticed if i am in an open space, but the receiver is on the opposite side of my body than the phone, it will sometimes cut up."
"overall, the bluetooth works well, and most issues i have would still be present with $300 bluetooth headphones."
my favorite feature is that they are waterproof!!
i have listened to music in the shower several times with no issues.
"granted, i don't generally have them under the stream of water, other than the occasional splash through."
"even when they are not directly under the water though, they still get consistently splashed with no issues."
"i have noticed that water does get in the charge port under the rubber ""seal""."
i always open that and wait for it to dry.
i don't think it matters how your headphones get wet though.
i don't think it takes much for water to penetrate the rubber seal on the charge port.
overall:
"great headphones, and i would buy them over and over again!"
would definitely recommend to anyone who wants decent sound w/waterproof and bluetooth.
"i don't usually review products, but i feel i have to warn potential customers how this seems to stay connected to your phone."
the bluetooth receiver is in the right-hand earbud.
if i put my phone in my front left pants pocket it has a choppy connection at best.
"at worst, it doesn't even work."
"the only reliable way i've found to use this headset is with my phone in my hand, which isn't viable for me (listening to music while at the gym and/or running)."
"i don't use a case for my phone, but i would imagine if it has trouble connecting when my phone's in my pocket, it'll have trouble connecting if i did use a case."
"giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because when it does work the sound is really good, and it's reliable as long as my phone's out of my pocket."
"if that's enough functionality for you, i'd recommend it."
"if you're using the headset for anything that you need put your phone down for, the $20 price tag isn't worth the frustration."
my son really liked these headphones!
they are comfortable and hang nicely around his neck when not using them.
if i were to have reviewed them the week we purchased... 5 stars!
"now alittle over a month later, they just stopped working."
"one minute he was talking with his friends playing an online game with everything fine, the next minute, nothing."
"fully charged, tried re-paring them with the computer, checked to see if they worked with the phone, but nothing."
"for the price, they are worth it."
"i did order another pair, hoping that maybe we just had a faulty one-"
i’ll be sure to review that pair once they come....
"after a month of use8/16/18 update: seller sent a replacement for the first pair ( i also ordered another set, now we have 2~which is good!)"
both pairs have been working very well since we got them.
we must have received a faulty pair the first time.
i am glad i have a pair to use now too.
great customer service for replacing them without me requesting a replacement
i just received these in the mail today.
"first impressions is that some of the mid-range audio is boosted (and some is just missing), highs are muffled, and lows are unnaturally boosted."
"i think this can be attributed to the natural sound isolation from the shape of the headphones causing a seal with the ears (which in and of itself is good, but the eq didn't seem to be calibrated to account for this)."
music doesn't sound that great on these.
"but they are super cheap, and i was paying for the convenience of wireless and had low expectations for good sound quality at this price point."
so i got what i paid for.
one other thing to note is that i was told that the mic didn't sound good by someone i was talking to on the phone.
i've been using them for about 3 hours and they're still going strong.
so hopefully battery life lives up to expectation.
they've lasted well
(i've had them for 9 months
"and i've not had any glitches or issues yet, which is more than i expected for headphones that cost me $14), and the connection quality is great."
"my only negative comment, other than the annoying feeling of the strap catching when i only have one headphone in (that's not a design/product issue, just happens when i choose to use only one of the headphones) - is the battery life."
it's super short compared to more expensive headphones i've owned.
"if i'm listening a lot, say on a travel day when i'm driving a lot - i have to charge it up by the end of the day."
i'd guess it has 12-15 hours of juice on a charge
"(i'm guessing, i haven't timed it)."
"as others have pointed out, these are not made for small ears."
the rubbery piece that goes over the ear isn't adjustable and doesn't touch my ears at all.
the piece that goes inside the ear is uncomfortable.
if i change to smaller ear pieces then it just falls out of my ear completely since the rubber piece doesn't go around my ear and
there's nothing holding it there.
the design is awkward and sticks out pretty far from the ear as well.
can't recommend them for anybody with smaller than average ears.
"i have owned many, many bluetooth headphones in my day."
mostly cause i'm a forgetful person and
some i straight up destroyed.
"and for the price, these are really good."
"great battery life, exceptional range, and good sound."
the sound is good
i've definitely had better sounding headphones
but they also cost six times as much.
"the control features are pretty intuitive, i wish the power button wasn't on the front of the right headphone instead it should be on top only because it jams the headphone in deeper when turning it on"
so you have to grab it with your other fingers so it doesn't go deeper in your ear.
"honestly, if that is my only complaint i'm really being nitpicky."
"oh and i might add i regularly take these into the wet sauna at the gym which destroyed some other headphones, these have held up just fine."
buy these you won't regret it for the price buy four and just replace them when you've lost or destroyed them.
i ordered these headphones for use at my new job.
we're allowed to listen to music or audiobooks all day as long as we use headphones.
the first few days i used wire headphones and didn't like that i couldn't move freely because i was attached to my phone via the wire.
"i was unsure about these, because i've never used bluetooth devices much in the past, but"
i'm glad i got these.
"the set up was super easy, just turn them on and click on them when they popped up on my phone screen."
the appointment quality is good and they even dull a little of the outside noise.
"when i have them on, i feel like i'm in my own little world despite being in the middle of a cubicle farm."
"additionally, i was worried that they'd randomly disconnect on me and all the sudden"
"my music would start blasting it off my phone's speaker, but they don't do that and, even better on my opinion is that when the headphones connect and disconnect, a little message plays in your ears ""your headphones have been connected/"
disconnected
""" so you immediately know."
so now i don't have to worry about that anymore.
amended review: i initially gave this a 3-star review (my unedited review is below).
i was put off by the size of the earbuds which just don't fit well in my small ear canals.
patozon customer service contacted me after my review posted and offered to send me a different headset.
"they sent me the mpow cheetah as a replacement, for free."
"it's a much better headset for working out as it fits tight to your head and doesn't have a big, loose cable like the flame does."
it sounds great.
"however, it still only had one size of earbud, which is still too big for my ears and doesn't create a seal."
"it's no big deal, but it's worth mentioning."
"that said, it was a really great customer service experience from patozon, so i'd recommend getting it from them as it seems like they are more than willing to work with the customer to get the right item."
original review:i use these at the gym.
for the cost they are fine.
they're not amazing by any standard.
two problems for me: (a)
i have
"really small ear canals and the ear buds on these only have a couple adapters; nothing small enough for my canal, so i don't get a seal of any kind to block exterior noise with."
that part is a bit of a bummer.
(b)
they do drop signal for split seconds during a workout.
signal strength seems to be better with a full charge.
"all that said, i didn't want to spend $100+ for a pair of bluetooth in-ear buds, so these work fine."
they pair with my android phone easily with no hassle
and i saved at least $80.
mpow sent me a replacement pair.
i'll update this review if they fail as quickly.
i'm suspect about the waterproofing at least as it seemed a sweaty workout was enough to put the prior pair to their early demise.
"as far as quality, sound, distance, pairing, etc..."
these are comparable to prior bt headsets that i've used.
the sound quality is nice enough
but i'm not about to be super critical for a pair in this price range.
they're good enough for me to enjoy listening to most anything.
they're comfortable and light.
here's to hoping the replacement pair lasts longer.----original review: 1 stari've owned a few headphones and these died quicker than any other pair.
i purchased on march 20 and it's just barely 1 month later
and they're dead.
"won't charge, pair or respond."
garbage.
"they sound good, but that's about it."
the battery life is about 10 hours at first but drops to about 8 or less within a month.
by then it's too late to return them.
"also, they die in under 10 minutes after it warns you the battery is low."
"which is terrible because if you take them to the gym and you are doing a 2-hour workout, like me, they can technically be dead in less than 15 minutes of use."
because before that you have no warning or signs of a close to dead battery.
this happened to me several times already within a 1.5 month span.
"because it's so cheap and they sound pretty good, 3 stars is the best these headphones deserve."
"if not the value, it is a frustrating 2 star product."
i purchased these because of the great reviews.
however these hurt to wear even after trying on several sizes and the memory foam to find the correct size and they are so uncomfortable i can barely wear them longer than 15 minutes.
also the pause button does not work.
however the sounds is good.5/7/2018: product update:
i exchanged the mpow flame bluetooth headset for the mpow cheetah
and they are so much better.
"they do not hurt to wear, the sounds is fantastic and their customer service is top notch.  "
also i have not received any complaints when i am using them to talk on the phone.
"i have asked if i sound """
"like i'm down a tunnel"" and each person have agreed that i sound great."
bella in customer service did not give me any hassle about the exchange and quickly replied when i sent them a message about my concerns.
i have been using them for almost a week and they are great.
my only complaint is i wish there was a batter life indicator other than that great product.
thank you!
i purchased these mpow wireless headphones to wear while going on my walks and while in the gym.  
they fit well in the ear
(had to use smaller earpieces which were included) and the sound quality is very good (nice bass and treble.  
the highs sound clear and crisp and the bass sounds deep and punchy).  
"my only complaint is when my phone is close but on the other side of my body from the main earpiece (the one with the controls and charger port), the bluetooth tends to skip or cut out during windy or very sunny days (in my testing at least).  "
"however, if my phone is a few feet away (10 to 30 feet), the sound is perfect (no skips or cut-outs).  "
i think this is a limit of the technology because i tried different brands and they all have the same problem.  
this one sounds the best out of the ones i tried.
i work in construction.
"i work in an area where i need moderate but not serious hearing protection, and don't have hazards that i need to be aware of at all times."
"so before you ask or accuse, yes it is safe for me to wear these while working."
"if i am in a situation where they are not safe to use, or i need more suitable hearing protection, i remove them."
"that aside, i chose these because i wanted bluetooth"
"so i wouldn't have a cord to catch on things,"
"a secure fit that is sweat resistent when its hot and rain resistent when they get wet, and don't fall out when i am bent over working on the ground."
"in addition to that, the button on the side allows me to answer my phone without pulling it out of my pocket and even if i have gloves on."
"the sound is great, they have a good enough seal to block out annoying to uncomfortable noises and there are easy to reach volume adjust buttons on the top."
"all in all these are exactly what i was looking for and they work great, except..."
the microphone is non- noise cancelling.
"not only that, it seems to be tuned to pick up every little background noise and amplify them overtop of my voice."
"again, the microphone picks up background noises better than it picks up my voice."
"its so bad, that if i receive a call and i am not in a completely quiet room by myself, i have to remove these things and switch to either phone or another device."
otherwise the person at the other end is guaranteed to complain that the background noise (which btw is not that loud and isn't bothering me at all) is deafening to them and they can't hear me.
"so to sum up, they are great for listening to stuff, not so great at making calls."
thanks for reading this review.
i've started running recently and was looking for a reliable pair of sweat proof bluetooth headphones.  
"these are the highest rated in a lower price range with the most reviews, so i figured it was a no brainer.  "
i've had issues with earbuds in the past but
"the ear hook, along with thousands of 5 star reviews, had me convinced these would stay in just fine.  "
"the packaging it arrived in was attractive, and i was happy to see multiple sizes of earbuds to try out.  "
"as a first test, i used them to cut the grass."
"they were plenty loud enough, but had absolutely no high end.  "
"i listen to music and podcasts, and neither sounded very good.  "
i figured i could make do if they stayed in my ears alright.  
"well, they didn't  as soon as i was sweating even the least bit, they started falling out."
every time i turned my head
i'd have to adjust them.
"on top of that, they started losing signal randomly for minutes at a time chopping up the podcast i was listening to.  "
i had to turn them off and on to smooth everything out.
"the hook is way too big to provide any help, at least for my ears.  "
i tried every ear piece adapter with no luck.  
the adapters i was using even started to rip after first use!  
i tried running in them once just to give it one more go.
same story.  
i was messing with them the whole time trying to keep them in my ears.  
i realized that having the wire behind my back would constantly pull at the ear buds no matter how the wire was adjusted.  
"all in all, i really wanted to like these headphones, but it wasn't the case."
update 8/20/18
: mpow sent me a different pair of headphones to try out:
cheetah bluetooth headphones.  
these seem to work much better for me.  
"thanks to mpow for the generous customer service, although it's strange that i never received an email or any contact prior to getting a new set of headphones."

update 8/20/18
: mpow sent me a different pair of headphones to try out:
cheetah bluetooth headphones.  
these seem to work much better for me.  
"thanks to mpow for the generous customer service, although it's strange that i never received an email or any contact prior to getting a new set of headphones."
this item was received on time.
"packaging looked fine, i.e. not damaged."
"apparently charged initially but after a couple of uses, sound would break up."
"after that, it no longer charged."
i sent a comment to the seller but received no response in the last three days.
"therefore, to let other potential buyers know their risk, i submitted this review."
"it could be a bad recharging connection, don't know."
"the bottom line is that i bought it, got it and within two weeks it doesn't work at all."
very disappointing because it worked fine with my ipod initially.
the seller sent a replacement and was cordial.
"however, after less than 10 uses, the replacement no longer works......"
happy with these headphones!
"i love that these headphones are attached, so you can leave them to hang around your neck."
i've never had them fall off while walking/running around.
sound quality- good for the price.
"not anything spectacular, but i also don't notice the standard tinny sound with a lot of less expensive headphones.battery"
life-
"decent, just plug them in after every use so you aren't surprised when they die in the middle of a workout!as far as comfort"
", that is the only reason i didn't give 5 stars."
over the ear headphones can be difficult because they make my ears sore.
after about 45 minutes of wearing these the inside of my ear gets a little sore.
i just take them out and re-adjust and it helps a lot
so there is less pressure on my ear.
still extremely satisfied with these!
this was just what i was looking for!  
put them in your ears straight out of the box.  
"press the big side button on the right side until it says """
power on.
"""  "
you are ready to go.  
paired up to my phone quickly and easily.  
sounds great.  
fits in my ears perfectly with the smaller eartips.  
"they seem a little difficult to remove and put on new tips, but i figured the trick of turning the ear part inside out.  "
they stay put in my ears unlike other headphones i have used that are constantly falling out of my ears.  
"they lasted for a continuous 7.5 hours of listening to music, computer watching, and talking on the phone.  "
"for the price, i was impressed with these.  "
i like the case too.
update:  
"as of august 21, 2019, they no longer charge.  "
"no matter what i do, when they plug into the usb port, nothing happens.  "
they were working just fine.  
"just went to charge them, and nothing.  "
"if they cannot charge, that is the end.  "
i did not even have them for one full year.  
you definitely get what you pay for.
4 month update:
great so far no issues in durability or battery life.
have owned it for a month now.
everything seems perfect so far.
"i wear my headset all day long for work, no complaints of audio quality on my cell phone."
i am a little tone deaf at high frequencies but the audio is clear and of good quality when i listen to music.
i am getting about 10-12 hours of daily life on the battery.
"my big question is the wire durability, ask me in 6-12 months if they have broken or not."
i hope they last...
"my lg tone headset only seems to last 8 or so months, gave up using that model."
bought these for the gym and was goi g to use the tones for work
but so far i have used these 100% of the time with no issues.
on with the torture test see you in 6-12 months. :-)
"for $20, this is by far the best earbuds i've ever had.  "
"the bass is amazing and with extra ear buds, there's one for every size.  "
the fit and finish of the product is very good considering the price.  
"charging is fast and battery life of 5 hours, could be longer"
but it's good enough.  
most importantly is that they hold to your ears very well and they are light weight.  
i have issues with earbuds since they are always falling out
and i have not had a problem with these.  
worked on my car for 4 hours and never once had i have to fix them from falling
and it's light weight made it comfortable for long periods of use.  
"easy to use and easy to connect and after my experience with mpow customer service, i'm happy to say i love their products and what they stand for.  "
they're an affordable alternatives to all those over priced
"""buy it for the name brand"" stuff that sounds equally as good."
would highly recommend these to anyone.
these are great.
"when deliberating between the amazon fire stick and roku with the headset capable control, i decided that the roku was a better option as i could use headphones for private listening - until i read a roku review where the user was unhappy with the low battery life for the roku controller."
"i knew the fire stick had bluetooth capabilities but seemed ""not as convenient"" as a simple plug in headphone but decided to research the issue."
"just to update the first review, i am so happy that i bought my second pair to use with my laptop."
"first, find a set of bluetooth headphones."
there were cheaper sets - about half the price but reading the reviews decided to spend a little more for the mpow flame headphones.
i don't know how the others work
but these are great - with thetv/
"firestick on, just turn on the headphones and they are picked right away - just click on yes"
and you're on.
i have used these for several hours before the low battery notification was verbalized and you simply plug in the charger and your good again.
very simple to set up.
i use these when mowing the lawn
so i can be wireless.
i can barely even hear my mower when they are turned on.
i've also used them to answer phone calls and
the end users all said it was as clear as day.
"pro tips: to put them in your eardrum easily, align the headset vertically with the control buttons facing forward."
then simply rotate your hands backwards and they slide right in.
"also, make sure the wire isn't twisted or it will put to one side."
this can be easily done because one side of the wire is red and the other black.
i simply hold them outstretched in front on me and make sure i only see red.
i took a minute when i first figured this out to work the rubber a little to stretch it out.
"if i could make one suggestion to the company, it would be to add a simple lanyard to the carry case."
that way it can be hung from objects or hooked to a backpack.
"when the smartphone makers removed the headphone jacks, i swore i'd never waste money on stupid wireless headphones."
"after resisting with dongles and adapters and other half-measures for years, this was the first pair of bluetooth headphones i ever bought."
"and i can say, for $20, they sound as good as any other headphones i've used and they actually make the gym-going experience better."
"the basics: the headphones work well, and the sound is fine (i'm mostly listening to podcasts so music fanatics might not find the quality up to their standards)."
"the pairing is simple and has a good range and rarely needs re-pairing, making it easy to turn it on and off and each day and have it ""just work."""
"as a wireless phone headset, it works great."
"i have big ears, so this fits well on me and, if you need something smaller, it comes with various little in-ear pieces you can swap out to make sure it fits your ear."
"wearing it is fine, the short loop of wire that goes over your next is great, and i'd much rather that"
than 2 independent earpieces that could easily become lost.
"the 3 buttons on the ""powered"" ear piece do a lot to turn on/of, raise/"
"lower the volume, and skip forward/backward."
"once you're used to it, it's easy to do what you want to do without thinking."
"some cons: battery life could be better, and as others have said, when the level go to 30%  it quickly dies."
"but still, a few days at the gym between charges is good enough for me."
a solid set of headphones that have made
"this 3.5mm jack purist a begrudging true believer that wireless may, in fact, actually be better."
"so long as something this good can stay around $20, it'll be something i buy and re-buy without spending $100+ on marginally better wireless headphones."
updated 7/24/2018after posting
"my review mpow reached out to me and sent me a brand new pair, even though i had already had my previous headphones for a few months!"
i can not be happier with how mpow took it upon their selves to replace mine at no cost to me.
it's amazing to see this level of customer service at the price point of the mpow flame headphones!
"keep up the good work mpow, you have a new loyal customer, and thank you!original postthese"
where great why they lasted but
after using these almost daily for the last few months they just stopped charging.
"i've been charging these from my laptop usb port since i bought them and haven't had any issue previously but one day they just stopped charging, the led that used to turn red when charging then blue"
when finished no longer turns on when plugged in and the mpow flame bluetooth headphones will not power on.
"i've tried a bunch of different charges and get the same results, they will not charge."
"i saw the ""unbox therapy"" video about these wireless headphone and decided that for the price, i would give them a try."
what can i say?
they are great.
are they super-duper hi-fi audiophile earphones?
no.
but i bought these to work out in.
they have above-average audio/bass.
"better than something you might buy at walgreens as a quick earbud substitute, but not as good as $200 headphones."
but they cost $19!
"i mean, seriously for what you get these are a steal.buy them, use them like you stole them, and you will be like me: utterly laughing at the fact that $19 can buy this good of a product."
all i could think of is that the companies selling $150 earbuds are just printing money.
this is the first pair of wireless earbuds i've owned
and i have no regrets.
i don't miss the cord snagging in everything or having to fish it through a shirt.
"the earbuds feel solid, no cheap plastic-like feel to them."
"as far as sound is considered there is a very slightly lower audio quality compared to normal wired earbuds, but that is to be expected for non-expensive bluetooth audio."
i've worn them countless times while exercising and walking through wet snow
and i've yet to have a technical problem with them.
"it would be nice if the ear hooks were a bit more malleable to better grip the ear, but i've never had problems with them falling off."
battery life depends a fair bit on what is being done with them and the range they are operating at.
"i've gotten 8 continuous hours of use listening to an audiobook, but"
usually i'd say they last 5-6 hours for music listening.
"the mic is good for phone calls while walking or sitting, but in overly windy or noisy environments it can become hard for the other person to hear you, the mic also picks up a lot of ambient sounds."
"overall, if you're looking for an affordable pair of bluetooth earbuds, these are a solid option."
"they sound good, the feel good, and after 6 months so far of ownership there's no signs of degradation."
"i give this product 5 stars because i use the product daily, and have since may of 2018 (it's now march of 2019).  "
the price is outstanding for the quality and durability.  
"i am an avid audio book listener, which us where they get the most use.  "
"i also often listen to music, movies and joyce meyer sermons, plus phone calls, all of which i think sound great!!  "
i can exercise without worrying my sweat
will interfere
"(i'm not a ""light"" sweater!), plus the cord never gets in the way.  "
"in the shower, i simply use one of those small hair clips to keep the cord on the top part of my head.  "
i've not had a problem with water
and i do this at least once a day.
"because i use them everyday (on and off during a 16 hour period), i usually alternate between 2 headsets"
so i don't have to wait for the one to charge.
"i have had 2 arrive that refused to sync, but they sent a replacement with zero delay, so i have no complaints!!  "
"there was a problem, they fixed it..."
i'm happy!
"cheap bluetooth headphones are a disposable commodity, i get that.  "
but in my view they should last at least two or three months of regular use.  
"these headphones have decent sound, intuitive controls, easy pairing and even a nice case.  "
but they only lasted three outings.  
sure i could have got a duff pair
but i still think it's important to report early failures in reviews if they do happen.
update:  
"to their credit, the amazon seller (patozon) immediately contacted me after i posted this review and sent me a replacement pair.  "
so for the moment i'm happy to assume my experience was a one-off
and i've upgraded them to four stars.  
"if the replacement lasts longer than three months, i'll upgrade to five stars -- less than two months"
and it's back down to two!update 2:  
"replacement broke after exactly three outings, again.  "
"so very consistent, but not in a good way.  "
trying to be as charitable as possible
we are in the middle of summer and it is hot -
and i do sweat a lot when i run.  
so i am prepared to believe that is the problem.  
"but they are advertised as ""waterproof"" and although sweat is more corrosive than water three outings is ridiculous.  "
"and yes, i did only charge both pairs of headphones using a 5v usb port (an ""important reminder"" card included with the headphones"
"makes it clear, if it wasn't already obvious, that ""quick charging"" at over 5v could damage the headphones)."
received this back on dec. 1st.  
"i've been using it exclusively at the gym (60-90 a day, six days a week).  "
today i decided i'm going to pair it with my laptop to get some work done as well.  
so i unpair it from my phone and pair it to the laptop.  
no problems encountered.  
"quality is still good, no mic issues, etc.  "
about 3 hours in though (of very intermittent use)
i got three beeps in my ear.  
from that point forward i had no sound.  
so i just shut the mpows off.  
upon turning them back on it went straight into pairing mode.  
i plugged them into the charger and within 10 minutes the light was blue
so i knew i didn't run out of battery.  
shut them down again and tried powering up.  
same issue.
i've emailed support and we'll see what they say.  
but for now this gets three stars because its a great device
but it shouldn't stop working within a month or so.
"tl,dr:"
"as other reviewers mentioned, this is great for the price."
the bass was great and sound quality overall was wasn't shabby at all but don't expect it to last the entire year
"( i will give it 6 month, tops)mine worked great for the first 4 months."
"it blocked out outside noise, held a charge for a decent amount of time"
( usually i only need to charge it once a day for using it anywhere between 8 to 10 hours of listening) and my sweat didn't bother it much.
"during the 5th month, i noticed the sound quality in one of the left earbud was degrading."
it wasn't as loud as the right one
and i also had to start charging it more frequently than before.
"in the 6th month, the left earbud went kaput and the right started deteriorating as well.  "
i guess its time to retire mine.
so $20 i really can't complain.
"these headphones were used 3 to 4 times a week, for about 2 hours each use."
"my workout consists of stretching, using the elliptical trainer, and using the foam roller for fascial restrictions."
"the ear buds and the hard plastic components were always wiped down and cleaned with a soft towel after each use, and they were always stored in the soft round case that came with the headphones.  "
"on days when i didn't work out, the headphone were left in the house (not in my gym bag in the car) so that they wouldn't be exposed to more varying temperatures and weather."
"when they were recharged once/week, they were promptly removed from the electrical source once finished so that the battery life would be maximized."
"those things being said, i was hoping that they would (at least) last me a year."
i feel that they were well cared for to maximize their life.
"given that the 4 previous bluetooth ""sports"" headphones that i've purchased through amazon only lasted me 6-7 months, i am giving these higher marks than those other ones."
"these headphones abruptly stopped playing towards the end of my workout 3 days ago, and attempts to turn them back on were unsuccessful."
"i tried to plug them back in to the electrical outlet, but they would not recharge or turn back on."
"given the price, there's a good likelihood that i'd purchase them again, knowing what to expect."
addendum:
"the seller patozon emailed me about my review and my rating (3 stars), and apologized for their product not lasting at least 1 year"
(they said that it may have been defective).
"to make up for it, they sent me a replacement headset ""no questions asked."
""" i am very open to amending my rating (i have changed it to 4 stars) due to their customer service, and their willingness to have me re-evaluate my experience with their product.  "
"i will give the new headsets a year, to see if they perform better, and will consider re-evaluating at that time."
"- connection is super fast (something i never really cared about until i used these guys)- sound is clear, a little more balanced toward the base side, many people like this-"
"sound is amazing, not tinny at all"
(something
all sub
100$ headphones have).  
i was shocked at their great soundthese headphones keep outside sound out too.-
microphone for phone calls while outside in windy areas is amazing.  
callers hear me perfectly fine and do not hear the outside noises that well.  
if very windy they hear it but not a big deal.  
"inside calls are perfectly clear, balanced in sound and callers do not know i am using a headset much less a microphone that sits so far away from my mouth."
the quality doesn't fail or fluctuate either.-
very comfortable to wear.
"it is simply amazing that headphones can work this well, for so long at such a price.  "
"believe the reviews, these $20 headphones rival $100+ ones, in my opinion."
i received these head phones today and i immediately love them!
i got these and put them to charge straight away.
they must have already been somewhat charged because they did need to sit long on the charger before they were ready to go.
"i paired them up (and they weren't kidding when they say fast pairing), and i started listening to music while working on homework."
i had them in for about 4.5 hours and my ears didn't hurt at all.
i finished my work and decided to try these bad ma'am-a-jam'as out on a run.
i ran for a few miles and still my ears did not hurt or ache.
the sound quality is really good too.
i had a different pair of sport wireless headphones and the sound would just not get loud enough.
"however, these new mpow head phones will blow your damn ears out!"
and the sound quality is dope
too!i highly recommend these headphones.
i highly recommend this brand.
these are the second pair of mpow headphones i have owned and they both blow the pants off other brands i've owned.
"i have these sport wireless ones and the mpow over the ear, red/black, bluetooth headset."
i will stick with this company for their quality work and affordable prices.
"thanks mpow!if your thinking about these, take a chance on them."
they're worth it.
ps:
"they come with multiple ear bud sizes and a pair of foam conforming tips, and they are simple to change out."
i have never used the foam tips before so i can't comment on those.
i bought these to use with a garmin fenix 5x
"plus, so i intended to use them while out walking, biking, hiking, etc."
pairing was fairly quick and easy.
"however, i've experienced regular problems where the earbuds just stop producing any sound."
"this would annoying at any time, but it's especially annoying when you're a few miles from home"
and you can't easily switch to another pair.
let me give some details on the problem i've experienced.
"this happens when the earbuds are fully charged, so this is not a case of low battery issues."
"the earbuds remain paired, so it's not a problem with the gamin losing the pairing."
"if paired earbuds disconnect, the gamin will stop playing music - indicated by the pause icon changing back to a play icon."
"however, with these earbuds, the garmin keeps playing music because the earbuds remain connected."
you just can't hear anything through them.
"when the sounds drops out like this, turning the earbuds off and back on doesn't solve the problem."
"it's possible to solve the problem by re-pairing the earbuds, but who wants to do that every time you try to use them?"
i've found another solution that occasionally works.
"once i can no longer hear the music, i stop the playback on the garmin."
"once the earbuds have gone long enough without something playing, they will power off automatically (usually within a few minutes)."
"once that happens, when i turn the back on and start my music again, the audio usually returns."
in this case it seems to be a problem with the earbuds - not the garmin.
"i've used another comparably-priced pair of earbuds, and they do not experience the dropout problem."
"i just wanted to use these, because they're a little more comfortable."
i'd stay away from these and look elsewhere.
"these headphones are fairly comfortable, but my issue is with the battery.  "
"the battery life itself isn't horrible, but when it tells you the battery is low, it's not joking."
i get about 8 minutes from the first warning until the headphones shut off.
"since i generally use these when i'm out running, that just doesn't work.  "
i'm half a mile into a 5 mile run
and i get the warning saying the battery is getting low.
so before i run another mile they are dead.
"for the next 3.5 miles, they are decoration.  "
"also, the right headphone clicks with every stride."
i'm guessing the button isn't quite snug enough.
"it's not horrible, but it's noticeable (especially when the battery has died).update"
"- i didn't ask for a replacement, but i received one after this review was posted."
"because of that, i have increased the review from 3 to 4 stars."
"i don't know if the replacement will be any better than the original, but clearly the seller wants their buyers to be happy and one can't ask for much more than that!"
the bass is so kickin' on these headphones.
"i am a bass head, so this is great for me."
"i can see why some say it's unbalanced, but i don't mind because i love bass so much."
"love these headphones, so much bass for so little headphones."
best i've ever had.
went for a bike ride with them today.
"can't say that wind noise was a problem, will have to pay more attention to that next time but given i can't remember any it must not have been bad."
i have very small ear canals and the smallest earpieces aren't small enough; the earbuds want to come loose from within my ear and if they stay in then my ears begin to hurt after less than an hour.
after reviewing the contents i found that there is a set of memory foam eartips.
they seem larger but perhaps the memory foam will be more forgiving; i will try them next.
if that doesn't work then i will have to shop for another pair of headphones.
"still like them though, it's not their fault"
my ear canals are small.
good headphones.
i was very happy with my mpow flame.  
"battery life, sound, comfort, charging, carrying case were all very good.  "
i am very careful with my ear buds and only use them for commuting or while at my desk.
"after 9 months the earbuds look like new, but suddenly, without clear reason, the left earbud no longer emits sound."
since there is an 18 month warranty i went to submit a claim.  
"it took some digging, but i found there is simply an email address.  "
"no interactive form, no details for how to submit a claim, just the statement that there is an 18 month warranty and to contact them.  "
"after searching i found the email xsupport xmpow.comi have some reservations with the process so far, but will withhold my judgement until i hear a response.  "
my hope is that they will send a replacement and i can change my review to 5 stars.  
"barring that outcome, i have to give a 1 star rating based on the 9 month life span for a very well cared for set of ear buds."
"but if it is an anomaly, and replacement is forth coming, i would gladly rate these based on a functioning set of earbuds and the additional knowledge that the warranty is honored."
update  7/4  
i contacted the support email
and they replied on 7/1 with some suggestions and then again saying that a replacement was being sent.
i did try the suggestion and it did not help.-
the ear buds are fully charged-
i tried a factory rreset-
these earbuds are in perfect condition.
they have never been wet.  
i only use them during my commute or while at work.  
"unless the act of using the earbuds with great care causes them to break, it cannot be due to user handling."
i will update if/when the replacements arrive and report on those buds.  
my spirits were raised by the quick and helpful response so at this moment i have high hopes for resolution to the issue.7/19  
i got my replacement set a couple of weeks ago.  
"it was brand new in the box with all the accessories, which i feel bad about.  "
i only wanted the a new headset
and they sent me everything.  
works great!  
at this point i am very happy.  
loved my mpow flame
",  was unhappy it stopped working,  but i am thrilled at the customer service and so happy to have them working again."
they really are great
a great earbuds and a pleasure to use.  
thank you for the great service patozon!  
i recommend you buy all your stuff from them
", i certainly will with customer service like that!"
update:
"since posting this review, the seller has contact me and shipped a replacement pair of earbuds without a request from me at all."
"i appreciate the initiative and the courtesy of it, and their follow-up emails regarding whether or not the replacement was received and whether or not it worked have been pleasant and positive."
"customer service of this standard is enough to make up for a product's short-comings, and i'm happy to increase their rating to reflect this."
"if you decide to buy these, you'll get your money's worth, and if you feel that you haven't, the seller has proven to be willing to do what they can to help you."
"there isn't much a person can ask for beyond that, at that point."
original review
": i've had these for about six months, and have loved them, but lately they barely hold a charge at all."
"i'd like to get them replaced, but i don't think i'll pay for another set of these, with such a short lifespan."
the volume range on these is not that great.
you cant even hear anything on the lowest volume and the highest volume
doesn’t go that loud.
as far as sound quality its bad but nor the worst.
there is a lot of background static/white noise that damages the quality.
and the fact that everything sounds stereo doesn’t make it better.
4/10 chance would buy again***update***i ended up receiving another headset from the company.
i believe it is called the “cheetah”.
they had significantly better sound quality and volume control.
the only downside for me is that if you have a larger neck or head like me then this is not the headset for you.
like me at the turn of the head it will slip out of either ear repeatedly.
however my mother who’s neck is slightly smaller loves it gave 4/5 stars.
update!!!/////i just got in my mail
and i was shocked to receive a brand new pair of mpows 😁😁
that alone moves my rating up!!!
you have to love a company that stands by their products!  
i have them charging and cannot wait to replace the silicone ear pieces with the included memory foam ones and use them at the gym tomorrow!!
"before my charging problem, these headphones were amazing, i absolutely loved them and was so disappointed when they stopped charging."
thank you so much for standing by your product!!!
"i highly recommend these for anyone with hard to fit ears, as they include multiple sizes of silicone inserts and my favorite the memory foam!"
"they sound amazing, paired with my droid phone super easily and are very comfortable to wear!!"
"the case that is included is great and well made, fitting easily into gym bags and purses."
they also look pretty darn cool!!
i decided i wanted wireless workout headphones.
"i had planned to buy a nice pair of airpods or jabras, but opted to give these a shot before i pulled the trigger on a pair of $150 wireless headphones for the gym."
these had mixed reviews but were dirt cheap.
i sweat an ungodly amount when i do cardio
"so i figured if these didn't hold up, no big deal."
after about 2 months i am still using them but here are some details.
pros:
they fit comfortably and stay on my ears securely.
"treadmill, weights,"
whatever...
they don't move.
i hit the gym 4 days a week for about 1 hour each visit and a full charge lasts me about 2 weeks.
they pair up with my iphone in seconds every time.
sound is acceptable.
i will address this below.
they are cheap and i don't have to worry about them breaking or getting lost.
i have not used any of the microphone/call features.
noise cancelling?
"with these snugly stuck in my ear-holes, i can't really tell if this feature is audio based or just a perk of the physical design."
"cons: despite any and all attempts to adjust eq, the sound quality is disappointing."
muffled and lacking in treble and deep bass.
nothing but a lot of ugly lower/mid frequencies.
"i listen mostly to podcasts while working out, so this is not a huge deal breaker for me, but listening to music on these headphones is pretty sad."
after about 2 weeks the right ear stopped working completely.
"after drying out for a couple days, it started working again."
"the low battery warning alerts you about 2 minutes before shutting down, which usually has left me with no headphones for the majority of my workout."
overall i think these are a good pair of headphones if you need something inexpensive and have your expectations set realistically.
$20 generic headphones are not going to measure up to a $150 brand name pair in the long run.
"if you sweat like a hog in the summer sun and listen to podcasts, audio books, or just really, really need your own music and aren't worried about pristine sound quality, these work fine."
"if these are your first wireless workout headphones and you find that you are using them a lot, you will probably be thinking about upgrading to something nicer in a few months."
"overall, the quality of these headphones are great for such a low price.  "
the thing to remember is; you get what you pay for.  
so a $20 pair of headphones is exactly that...a $20 pair of headphones.  
"but considering the price of other wireless headphones on the market, the price and performance is great.  "
"if you want wireless headphones and don't want to spend a crazy price; or if like me, these would be your first pair of wireless buds, start with these."
my only complaint would be that the volume doesn't go low enough.  
"so when i turn the volume down all the way on the headphones and the device it's paired to, it's still a little too loud for me.  "
your mileage may vary.  
"but for under $50, it's worth giving it a try."
"my experience with the mpow flame bluetooth headphones sport had its ups and downs but, overall, it ended on a high note."
my first set died on me after a few months: on november of 2018 they simply refused to turn on again.
that disappointment was immediately ameliorated by the manufactured by sending me another pair at no extra charge.
awesome.
"this was important for two reasons: it showed me their support was amazing and, two, it made me realize the first unit i ordered was probably defective, since the replacement worked like a workhorse non-stop."
the unit had also a decent range.
"the walls in my home are totally made from cinder blocks (no cardboard walls anywhere), and yet i could get almost a 30 feet range, although it predictably started to stutter at that point and then cut off completely a little further away."
"twenty feet away it still had excellent reception, though."
"the sound quality also was pretty decent; maybe not for the audiophile, but for a guy like me who wanted music to sound good at a low price tag, they were awesome.  "
the over-the-ear design also was extremely good to keep the earbud safely attached to my ear.  
earbuds that are merely squeezed onto the ear canal without any other form of support are not as good to keep them in place when the cable is tugged.
"i said ""had"" and ""was"" since"
"three weeks ago i either lost them, or they were stolen from me."
"since i was already used to the freedom of having bt earbuds, i bought another brand at a local marshalls"
"(photive sports flex2 wireless neckband earbuds),"
"but despite the showy display box, they are much much inferior than the mpows not only on sound quality but range as well (barely 10 ft before they stop receiving any signal)."
i would happily trade the extra hour of battery life from the flex2 to the sound quality of my old mpows.
"i miss my mpows terribly :), so"
i'll probably re-order them at a future time.
"in the meantime, i'll have to bite the bullet with the flex2. :-("
"ok, i order alot from amazon & i"
"rarely write reviews, but these headphones are blowing my mind to the point that i feel the need for a review.  "
"first of all, shipping."
unbelievably fast shipping.
"i kid you not, i ordered them maybe a week ago, if not less, and i've gotten them already."
and i used regular shipping.
that's very impressive.
now on to the headphones.
"they came in an adorable circular zipped up holder with extra sized tips, charger, etc."
i had to change the size of the earbud to a smaller one (because i have tiny earholes
lol).
"also, i've always been iffy about trying headphones with the clip over the ear because i assumed it would be uncomfortable, but i got tired of my other headphones falling out of my ears, so i figured i would give these a shot."
and boy am i glad i did!
they are so comfortable.
"the part that goes over your ear is some kind of soft material (not sure exactly what it is), but it is perfect."
"now, on to how they work ("
my favorite part).
i'm not a professional when it comes to music by any means.
i am just a regular girl who loves listening to music.
"but in my opinion, these bad boys sound amazing!"
"the sound is crystal clear and loud, which was a requirement when i was searching for headphones."
"a few times my son has came up to me to get my attention because i couldnt hear him, and he's 7, so he's pretty loud"
lol
the sound coming from these headphones is incredible to me and they are simply perfect for my needs (listening to music while cleaning & various other things).
"i havent tried phone calls yet, but i am hopeful that they will be equally amazing for that."
"ive ordered probably a dozen bluetooth headphones, if not more, in the past few years ranging from $1-$50 and these are by far the best quality ones i've ever received."
"it's only the first day using them, and i will update if i have any problems or issues, but as of now, i am so satisfied with them!"
they fit amazingly which is good because i have smaller ears and its very difficult to find earbuds that fit the inside or outside of my ear comfortably.
"the sound is amazing in my opinion, so much so that my friend has been able to sneak up on me so often because i can't hear her lol!"
"my only quarrel is some times it will charge, sometimes it won't."
right now it seems it has to be below a certain battery level to do so?
that or
maybe the charging wire is going or the earbuds are.
not sure which.
:(edit 12/28/2018:
"the company has sent me new earbuds due to my charging issues with the older ones, and i must say, these ones are charging no matter when i plug them in, low battery level or not."
:) i greatly appreciate the company going out of their way to ensure a great customer experience!
i have changed my 3/5 stars to 5/5 due to the new ones being absolutely perfect now and the customer service that was provided to me.
"if i ever need any new headphones or earbuds for myself or others, i will certainly come back to this brand."
"i typically stay away from in-ear buds, simply because i find them to be uncomfortable."
they also fall out really easily too.
but i haven't had any of those issues with these buds.
"i swapped to the included memory foam buds, and they work incredibly well!"
sound-cancelling is also great.
pairing is instantaneous after initial setup.
"once you turn the headphones on, it's connected."
there's also very little
(if any)
audio delay when watching videos
", so you can use this for more than just music."
my only slight complaint is the sound quality.
"it has great bass, especially for $20, but i found that what it has in bass, it lacks in treble."
vocals ended up sounding pretty unclear.
i was able to fix the situation with some eqing in my samsung s9+
"'s settings, but not everyone's devices will have settings like that."
"also, my car stereo system is the opposite, where it has clear audio, but slightly lacks bass."
"the s9+ can't swap between eq settings depending on the bt device, so i'll have to redo the eq in my car too, to better match the settings in my phone."
"there's also a very light static sound, but you can only hear that in between songs when it's absolutely silent (really not a big deal, and shouldn't put anyone off from buying this product)."
"but all-in-all, i'm very pleased with the buds, and will definitely be buying again in the future!"
"the gripes sound major, but i was able to fix the eq issues in a matter of minutes."
"if your phone has advanced eq capabilities, cutting the 250hz range and boosting treble frequencies should help."
i've attached a photo of my eq settings on my s9
+.
"i am in no means a sound engineer, but this set up is what sounded best to me."
hope it helps!edit:
the buds also have a very light static sound.
but it's only audible in-between songs when it's quiet.
"doesn't affect audio fidelity at all, and shouldn't bother anyone too much."
"edit #2: i've tried a second eq setup, which i've attached to the review (the one with the left-most slider raised up higher)."
"this one has higher impact (from the kick and low toms), but still decently good clarity."
"this is the one i'm currently using, and will continue using."
"the first setup is slightly clearer, but with much less impact from low frequencies."
"again, these are merely suggestions that i came upon after experimenting with the headphones."
"i'm in no way in expert, so you may come across a better setup."
"if you do, please include it in a review so others can enjoy!"
"great headphones, but ended up returning them because of how uncomfortable they were."
"first of the headphones had great sound and made listening to music more enjoyable, the controls were responsive and it connected to my phone very quickly."
"however, the headphones were uncomfortable to wear, the round plastic part that goes into your ear was very painful and made listening to music often uncomfortable for more than 10 minutes."
i tried wearing this with a winter hat on
and this made the feeling more painful
and it was hard to enjoy my music.
if you can get past the uncomfortable feeling or fix it for yourself then you will like these headphones.
edit:
the company reached out to me an new version of a previous pair of headphones that i own from them.
this company has provided the best customer service i have ever seen
and i will continue to buy more products from them.
i highly recommend trying their products as they deserve it for how hard they try to keep their customers satisfied.
finally got to use headphones after having them about 2 months.  
"good low bass, but the tweeter(s) must be broken."
no highs at all.
all i hear is a muffled sound although audible.
fit is good.
packaging was good and a good assortment of different ear fitment was provided.
bummed on the sound as they fit pretty well.
i don't know if i got a bad set as no one else
seemed to complain on this issue.
update:
10/5/2018i was reached out to by company regarding my issues.
they sent me a new updated set.
"i do apologize to them for taking so long to update my review, but in fairness, i wanted to run them for a while in all my conditions before i posted a review.1."
they were very fast with my issues2.
they sent a new pair just as quick3.
they were (imo) genuinely concerned that i be taken care of.now the product:i have ran with them 2 to 3 times a week for a good 3+ months and have nothing but good things to say about them.
i have used them at work as well.
"they sound good, stay in well (even during trail runs when there is lots of jumping)."
they have been sweat soaked and dirty.
they charge relatively quick and last a long time!!
bonus as i run for hours sometimes.
(ultra's).
thank you to their customer service for taking care of my issue right away.
"for the price and quality, you cant go wrong."
update:
less than a year later product has totally died.
"bottom line is that compared to my sony mdrzx750bn (over $100 when i purchased them), these $20 no name chinese brand headphones should be utter junk.  "
"the sad truth is that they easily match the sony, and when you consider the price point, they beat them outright."
range (30ish feet through 2 walls) and sound quality (tested both on phone playing more compressed mp3 formats as well as flac from the computer) are pretty much the same as the sony.  
"noise cancellation comes from their tight fit as far as i can tell, and compares to the sony technology based noise cancellation.  "
"they are somewhere above ""meh"" but still slightly below ""good"" when it comes to using them to talk on the phone."
there you have it.  
my advice would be to at least try out these before sinking $100+ on brands that we have come to think of as high quality.  
too many western brands and products from everything including soldering irons to headsets got complacent and stopped innovating for far too long.  
"combine this with no protection against city sized manufacturing complexes that have employees that are paid nothing, and the old brands now find themselves on a horrible back foot.  "
"this does not apply to all products by any means, but i think that these headphones are a solid example of the state of things."
"i bought these as a replacement for my 3rd set of soundpeats wireless headphones, which were similarly priced and sized (interestingly, the female voice that tells you when the headphones connect to your bluetooth device sounds exactly the same).  "
so i will be mostly comparing these two sets of headphones.
"although i was quite satisfied with the performance of the q9a model soundpeats, the contacts in the charging port in every set of soundpeats would come apart after ~6 months, rendering the headphones unchargable, and due to design of the charging part, effectively irreparable."
"the charging port looks the same on this mpow set, but i plugged them in and charged them up very quickly.  "
"i didn't much care for the ear loops, which seem to be unreinforced/loose and larger than the loops on the soundpeats.  "
"the headphones themselves are light though, and the ear plugs fit snugly into my ears; they stay in while walking, but i don't know if they will stay in while jogging.  "
"i can say that the soundpeats also fit snugly though, both due to the ear plug portion as well as the smaller reinforced loops, and they never fell out despite many miles of running and countless workouts in the gym."
"the initial pairing with the mpows and my iphone 7 was nearly effortless, and subsequent attempts to connect have been lightning fast, even faster than with the q9as.  "
"unfortunately, my experience with these headphones basically ends shortly thereafter, due to sound quality.  "
"the sound is very muddied and muffled, almost to the point of being painful.  "
"lots of what seems to be low frequency that i cannot adjust out, simply with the built in eq on the iphone.  "
"for comparison, i never changed the eq settings with the q9a or apple wired headphones, and those both sounded clean and clear for all uses (music, podcasts, phone calls).  "
"i tried a few different kinds of music that i listened to often with the other headphones, as well as a few different podcasts, which i listen to daily, and i just couldn't take the sound.  "
in fact my ears are ringing a bit right now.
"i bought these simply based on the average high ranking they got on amazon, but they are unfortunately unusable for me.  "
i'll be sending them back tomorrow.
"works ok, charge seems to hold well, though i've never pushed them for more than a couple of hours."
sound is good for price point.
they can get up to decent volume.  
"the low end is good, better than the many other bt and wired earbuds i've used before.  "
"the high end response sound is not that great, but for $20 price, i'm not complaining."
other points below are based on my experience only.  
"heads and ears vary from person to person, so your experience may be different.."
the boxy size is a bit large and took a while to get used to.  
"the ear hangers are very flexible (like gummy worms) and while comfortable, are not stiff enough to securely hold the large earbud on/in my ear.  "
it also makes it harder to put them on over long hair or glasses.  
the included memory-foam tips helped to compensate and made for a better fit for me.
i wasn't expecting much for the price of these buds.  
"however they paired very quickly, they fit nicely, the sound is fine, not super high quality, but fine.  "
"what i really love is that i put them on this morning at 3am, and here it is after 9am"
and i have not had to charge them yet.  
they have been on for over 6 hours and still running..
i freaking like that.  
"i listen to news, music, etc..."
while working and these are perfect for that.
update -
it is now almost 3pm
and so these lasted 12 freaking hours with continuous usage b4 giving me the battery low voice...
i hope this is not just because they are new..
this is awesome!...
"if anything changes in the upcoming month, i will update again."
i have researched bluetooth headphones for awhile now.
i've asked friends what kind they have and how they like them and what the battery life is like.  
well i found these and love the sound quality they are better than (my) other in-ear headphones and for battery life - they are doing amazingly well.  
"i get about 7 hours from them, now with that said -"
i pause them multiple times a day for up to 20 mins.
(at times)  
they are (at least seem to be) well made.  
"the over the ear piece is very flexable - and while i like that, sometimes its a little too flexible.  "
for example i have to wear reading glasses....  
so if i have my glasses on and go to put these in/on it
takes a minute (by a minute
i mean like 7-8 secs per ear) to get the piece to go where i want it to go.  
but once in place they are good to go.  
i changed the stock ear pieces with the memory foam ones and they work a little too well (for work).  
i don't hear anyone when they knock on my door or call my name.  
but for home use - this is perfect for me!
i realize that these headphones are inexpensive
but i still expect them to last more than a year and a half.
"when they worked, they were wonderful."
decent sound.
sweat proof.
they would stay in my ears during gymnastics.
the could hold a charge for a few days and slowly the battery started lasting less and less time.
today they finally died.
i don't subscribe to the american ethos of having all products be disposable.
i'm never buying anything from this company again and instead i'll save my money and buy high quality headphones that will last me for many more years to come.
don't buy these headphones unless you have money to burn.
update 5/14/2019:
i posted the above negative review and all of the sudden a brand new pair of headphones appeared in my mailbox.
this is incredible customer service!
"so far, the headphones are as amazing as the first pair was at the beginning."
i will treat them well and hopefully they'll continue to charge past the 18 month mark.
i'll keep you all posted.
i changed my rating from 1-star to 5-star because of the completely unexpected superb customer service i received.
only time will tell if the product is able to last longer than the original one i purchased.
update(nov.): today my headphones started acting funny like the wire is going out in one ear.
however i still recommend.
$20 for bluetooth headphones seems worth it considering they lasted 6+ months.
update( dec 2018)
: i contacted the company about my one of the headphones going out and they completely replaced the item by sending me a new one.
i didn't even have to send the old one back.
would definitely recommending buy from them for yourself or as presents.
there is a 18-month warranty on them if you have issues.
i will complain that i don't love the short battery life
but they aren't too bad compared to some others i've bought.
will purchase another when these do finally break on me.
love this product!!!
i will be buying multipe for xmas presents this year.
highly recommend they are well worth the price.
"they look like beats by dre, and when i see ppl with those i think its so stupid how they paid over $100"
and i only paid $20 for mine to work just as well.
you wont be disappointed.
the battery life is okay.
last about two-3 days listening to music for a few hours each day( works for my commute)
i purchased these ear buds because i wanted something that was inexpensive that i could use while working at my desk.
i did not have high criteria since these would be used mainly while i am at my desk at work.
turns out these headphones are so much more awesome
then i expected.
"i really like the string that attaches them, because i am able to remove them and leave them hanging around my neck while i walk about the office, and other people speak to me."
"also, the audio notification ""power on your headphone is connected"" whenever i turn them on is great!"
"also, i like the 'power off' notification."
"something i learned today as well was: as i listen to the headphones, and a call comes in, it audio notifies me of the number calling!"
what!
hands down these are the best purchase i have made in a long time.
highly recommend these headphones.
the sound quality is pretty good too.
"i am looking for excuses to purchase more, but alas, i only need one pair."
updated review: 4 stars mpow cheetahcustomer service received my original review and sent out a pair of mpow cheetah's automatically.
these headphone are a lot more satisfactory.
good cleary and balance on bass/treble.
no eq'ing necessary.
overall comfort is a 7/10.
i had to switch to the bigger included rubber pads to help create a better seal on the ear canal.
my only problem with the set is they sent me out a neon pink headset.
"while i will wear it, i would of preferred black or the color i originally ordered (red).  "
i would highly recommend ordering the mpow cheetah's over the mpow flame's.
thanks for the good customer service.
original review:
2 stars mpow flamewith a flat eq
these headphones sound horrible.
"they exhibit all bass, with only some mids and no treble."
with some eq tweaks you can get a somewhat listenable but muddy sound from them.
i would not recommend these to a friend.
"needed a portable set of bluetooth earbuds for work, and saw these."
"figured for the price, they would be just ok."
i was pleasantly surprised at
"how fantastic they are - they paired perfectly with my cell phone, tablet and laptop."
sound is really good and the carry case makes it easy to just pop into my laptop case or purse.
battery lasts quite a while and easy enough to charge up.
"i'm not always a big fan of earbuds because they never seem to fit right, but these things fit like they were made for me."
"they don't fall out while walking, or even head shaking."
i've used them with my cell phone to make calls and the microphone and speakers are crystal clear.
"this is a great value for the price, and you won't be disappointed in the quality of the earbuds."
"i loved these, a lot."
until they stopped working today.
they were charging overnight.
i tried to use them for my run this morning and they will not turn on.
the light is not on while charging.
it is past my return period by 2 weeks of course.
i have only used them for a month and a half.
they should have a much longer life.
edited to update-
the company sent me a replacement pair.
i appreciate their promptness in replacing them.
"i hope these ones work for longer, because when they work, they are great!"
have used these a handful of time.
"they pair quickly and seem to have good battery life, though i haven't pushed that too far."
i like the over ear fit
", it's comfortable and secure when i run.  "
"sound quality and volume seem fine to me, though i'm not too picky about sound quality in general."
"the button configuration is a little unnatural - specifically it seems to me that the volume controls are backward, and the button i always expect to be"
"volume up actually turns it down, and vice versa."
i'm sure i'll get used to that eventually.
pros:
amazing noise isolation.
i tested it while listening to loud music.
"i took them out to see if they leak any noise, and they"
didn't.
great noise cancelling.
"it's not the best, but it's up there."
it's great for how much it's worth.
awesome sound quality.
"the sound is clear, even when the volume is high."
they're water proof.
"i haven't used these in the shower, but i have bathed with them, and i love it."
they're mostly comfortable.
"the only comfort complaint is you can't lay on your side with these, but they're not made for leisure activity."
"cons:like all blue tooth headphones, they can die after several hours."
turn them off when you're not using them.
"they charge pretty quickly, so that's not too much of a problem."
mine didn't come with instructions.
"i'm not sure if it was an isolated incident or none of them come with instructions, so i had a hard time figuring out how to use them."
the logo on the right ear phone is a button.
"hold it to turn it on or off, press it to pause a song or video, to answer a call, to hang up, or to redial."
press the + button to turn the volume up and - to turn the volume down.
holding+
"let's you skip, and holding - will repeat the song."
those are all the features i know as of now.
"despite the cons, i'm giving 5* because the quality is great, and they're just what i'm looking for."
i had very modest expectations from these headphones based on price
but i can definitely say these headphones definitely exceeded them.
using them daily for about a year and half.
i mostly use it with my ipad pro as well as iphone 8.things
i like:-
clear sound.
i'm not a music aficionado but the sound is clear and works well and is comparable with apple airpods as well as sony over the ear headphones that i use.
i mainly use these while playing fps games like pubg and cod on my ipad as well as listening to npr on the phone.-
they come with 3 different ear tips and fit perfectly without feeling too tight.
the loop that wraps around your ear definitely helps to keep them in place without being uncomfortable-
"battery has held up pretty well after using these for about 18 months now, it gives you low battery warnings about 10-15 minutes before shutting down instead of abruptly shutting off like my apple airpods and other brandsi haven't used them during exercise so cant attest to its waterproofing claims."
but i have worn then while doing yard work for hours and didn't have any issue.
i have also taken phone calls few times and used the built-in mic in games without any noticeable issues.
cons:
cant think of any based on my usage.
these have survived being pulled and thrown around by a toddleri would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for basic headphones that exceed their quality expectations compared to asking price and in fact work as well as some of the other headphones many times more expensive.
"i use these for music (of course), editing videos at work (i don't want plug-in head phones here - too much lightening when we get storms which makes me nervous - plus i hate dangling wires), and at home when i want to watch tv"
but my so wants to sleep lol.  
"if i was doing some major video production, i'd use studio monitors and/or my sennheisers, but for what i do they are great."
battery life is decent.
"if i have them fully charged in the morning, they will last me my whole work day and then some."
"the audio is crisp, but not too crisp and relatively full.  "
"they aren't bose, or some other expensive brand, but they really are decent, especially for the price."
"i have all kinds of ear buds and stuff floating around, but these are my favorites."
i actually want to get a second set
so i can just keep one here for work and leave the other home.
i hope this helps!
for $20 these are not too bad especially considering the carrying case and the other ear tips.
after using these for the first day i found the audio quality to be totally reasonable.
the downsides are pretty substantial however.
"i have found that whenever i unlock my phone, i hear a loud beep (i think it’s to indicate that the headphones are paired) but it is still quite jarring because the volume control doesn’t seem to control the beep level."
i’ve also found that the volume control on the headphones themselves don’t have any sort of response when i click them up or down
so it’s hard to tell if i’m actually doing anything since the increase or decrease is very subtle on the output.
the most aggregous problem i’ve had is the call quality.
"where the music volume and quality are pretty good, the call quality is so bad it might as well be nonexistent.  "
i picked up a call and maxed out my volume
and it still sounded as though my friend who helped me test this had set his phone down and was trying to speak to me with
his back turned and in another room.
on the receiving end he claimed that i sounded as though i was speaking through a thick mask.
for context we were sitting in the same room and speaking at a normali am not sure if this is just a bad one from the factory or if this issue persists across all of them.
hopefully i just got unlucky and others will be more fortunate.
edit:
i was contacted by the seller who very kindly offered not only to refund my purchase but to additionally send a replacement pair to see if it was just a bad set.
unfortunately this pair had the exact same problems with call quality as the original pair
but i am adding a star for their spectacular customer service going out of their way to try and rectify the issue.
edit 2:
"the second pair of the flame headphones had the same issue as the first so in a final effort to fix the issue, the company sent me the mpow cheetah as a replacement."
this ended up solving the call quality issue but the music and sound quality is not as good as the flame.
i am totally happy to keep the cheetah though because i would rather have inexpensive headphones that allow for calls as opposed to better sound quality but no calls.
i can’t stress enough how incredible their customer service was and have added yet another star to the review because they insisted on getting me a working pair even though they had already reimbursed me and didn’t need to do that.
"well done mpow, well done."
"one of the best pair of headphones i ever purchased, and i have purchased a lot.  "
the price is extremely convenient and the sound you get is amazing.  
the best feature of these headphones for me is the fit.  
i have been looking for a set of headphones that fit snugly in my ear and didn't feel like they were going to fall out.  
the mpow headphones are the first pair i have found that meets the criteria for me.
the internal plugs are perfect and not to big
and i really like the over the ear design.  
they keep the headphones in my ear
but i can barely tell they are there.  
if you want some good inexpensive headphones i highly recommend the mpow flame.
i bought a pair of headset.  
"it hard time to pair,  and connect and keeps saying in my hear"
your phone is connected every 30seconds.  
it was ennoying and the battery life was short.  
"once connected and playing music, it works great and if you like bass sound, you will be happy."
"i contacted the seller for the following reason: hard to pair, low battery life, and ennoying ""your phone is connected"" ."
their response was expedite and professional.  
"i will buy another set for my wife, now that i am used to the headset and waht to expect."
review as of 04/17/18.  
(i will update as the months pass on quality of the earphones)-right out of the box these earphones are absolutely amazing for the price.  
pairing is easy and the battery life is great.  
i read a lot of reviews before i bought these
and i was skeptical after seeing the ones that started to catch fire.  
"with that being said after having these and reading the warning that comes with the earphones stating, ""do not plug in to anything greater"
than 5v
"to charge, use usb only"""
its pretty self explanatory.  
i have charged these several times just using the usb outlet on my computer
and i have had no issues.  
the earphones don't even feel warm after being plugged in all day.-if i were to nitpick at these earphones at this price
the only inconvenience that some people might find is the cord that attaches the two earphones together.  
i really don't mind it though for 20 bucks.  
earphones may be uncomfortable to some people as well but there are a variety of different attachments that come with the item to fit your ears.-to me music sounds great coming out of these.  
if you are an audio purest i am not sure why you are looking at $20 earphones to begin with
but i have nothing to complain about sound wise since i have used them.-overall a great pair of earphones if you are on a budget for a set of wireless earphones like me to run/workout with.  
warranty service for these are great as well if you happen to get a bad pair.  
"5 out of 5, two thumbs"
way up for me so far.  
give these a try.
"sound is good, the standard for the price point."
design and comfort are also good.
secure and comfortable.
only complaint is that the cord is a tacky rubber type material that sticks to your skin when you turn your head.
i prefer a slick material for the cord in this type of product.
my first pair battery stopped charging after about 8 months of daily use.
"again, not surprising for this price point."
"i ordered a new set that arrived with a defect that stopped the left side from working, but the seller very quickly sent a replacement that worked great."
"this new set worked for about 3 months until it was seemingly destroyed by my sweat, so the ipx7 rating is probably a little optimistic."
"sound would intermittently cut out when the sweat got heavy, this got worse and worse over time until it stopped working altogether."
bought these because they were on sale and i needed wireless headphones for work.
i am paying the price.
these are the most uncomfortable headphones i have ever worn in a long time.
the feeling is honestly similar to that plastic earbud design that were super popular in 2004.
"they are way too big if you have even slightly undersized ears, the medium buds about the size of a typical large."
"the small buds are laughably smaller, and would work if it weren't for the fact that the plastic hook meant to hook over your ears isn't adjustable and therefore doesn't even touch mine."
so my options are either painful ears or headphones that fall out every few seconds.
neat.
"the audio quality isn't bad, though nothing to write home about."
the buttons have lag between when pressed and when responding.
the pause button is in an awkward place that means you press it when you put them in or adjust them.
it's just not great all around.
edit:
"the mpow team sent me a replacement, as they felt that the headset they sent me was defective."
"the replacement sent to me, without my provocation, was not the same model as the one purchased, so i cannot accurately alter this review or review the new set here."
"i've bought two, because i left the first pair in my boyfriend's car (and he drove them to another state ;-)which means i am very satisfied with this wireless earbuds."
"i run with them regularly, 10-28 miles a week, 3-8 miles per run... plus cool down time."
they last 1.5 hours easily.
"probably a lot more, but i recharge each time."
"the sound quality is good (excellent for the price), and they hang nicely."
other wireless earbuds
i've had tend to be heavier on one side because the control is attached to the line.
"these have the controls in the ear itself, which makes the earpiece bulkier, but also means less noise with movement."
controls for volume are good.
"connects well with bluetooth (ipod and phone).no complaints, good deal for price!"
.***********review
updated as of 5/1/18 .
i first received a defective pair of headphones and was very unhappy after many unsuccessful attempts of pairing with my iphone 7.
after reviewing the product the sellers apologized and sent me another set which paired immediately.
quality of sound is pretty awesome !
loud
and i see no negatives for this product.
the seller stood behind their product .
"5 stars , 2 thumbs up !"
below is my initial review for the initial pair sent to me :if i could give it 0 stars i would .
do not buy it if you have an iphone .
"the item was defective , i cannot pair it up with my iphone 7."
i read the q&a’s and read you have to press the button for a long time to get it to work.
it only says “ connected “ or “ power off “ but not “ paired “ and the connection with ny phone was unsuccessful.
what a waste of money .***********review
updated as of 5/1/18
"if you are looking for cheap, yet well performing bluetooth headphones"
these are the best option currently for around $20.
"they are waterproof, last around 6-8 hours, feel very comfortably, and also fit well on my ears (and probably most people)."
the wire is heavier and definitely not built from flimsy material either.
as a matter of fact the only reason i gave these 4 stars is because while they state they receive hi-fidelity sound
"i would seriously doubt it considering the audio could be muncher clearer, in depth, and louder."
"also, while the mic seems so pick up noise decently well, it could be better and it does not seem to cancel out much background noise from what i have been told by people who were on the other side of my calls."
"overall, i didn’t expect top of the line quality for $20"
so i’m still gonna day
these are the best bang for your buck.
good job mpow!
"i got these mpow flame bluetooth wireless earbuds less than 3 months ago and today they stopped working,  they will not pair with cell phone"
"(i tried 3 different phone), nor will it pair with laptop.  "
"it's light blink to prepare to be seen, but my laptop and phones cant see it.  "
"the primary phone it was used with everyday will randomly allow it to pair/connect, but"
it only least a few seconds and then disconnects...
that is in between it not even connecting at all.  
very disappointed in he lack of quality.  
background on how these have been used:  
i have never gotten them wet or worked out w/them to test their waterproof claim.  
i use them throughout the day to listen to videos on my phone
", that's it..."
to rough & tough treatment.
update:
almost 1 year later my headset has died!
it no longer works.
it started turning itself off while i was using it
and now it wont even turn on.
i charged it until it was fully charged just in case it was dead.
only to find out its like dead-dead.
its too late to get a replacement.
i'm going to go with another brand as i am extremely unhappy
this didn't even last a year!i hate how it'll just jump on the office tv
(we have a bluetooth speaker) sometimes but other than that i love them.
the rubber ear piece has started to fall off.
"but in the defense of the item, i just throw them in my bag without the little case."
so i guess i'll give it a pass.
i've had it 5 months now.
i bought a pair of these last november.
"they worked great at first, then about 2 months in, started cutting out when i would move around in the gym."
"the battery life was decent, would give me around 10 hours, charged easily."
"however, the cutting out got worse and suddenly yesterday i put them on"
and they were completely dead.
"no sound, no lights, can't charge them, nothing."
"they lasted a little over 6 months, which is pretty poor quality even for cheap wireless headphones."
i bought them as an alternative to spending over $100 on airpods.
but now that i'm looking at having to replace them so soon i may have to look at that.
3/1/2019
update:
"without asking, the company sent me a replacement headset, which is outstanding."
"its not the same design of the previous headset, this one was touted as their ""latest"" design."
"the sound is acceptable for a waterproof headset in this price range, but i'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because its not a design i would have chosen as its bulkier than the previous design."
original review
:i purchased these in september and used them 3-4 times per week in spin class plus the occasional walk.
"they had decent sound quality (a little muddy in the highs), about what i expected for this price."
pairing and connecting worked fine.
mine biggest issue is that after four months they stopped charging or turning on.
"they did not get especially wet the day they stopped working, but when i came home from class and went to plug them in there were no lights."
tried several cables and chargers that worked fine with other devices.
i have a very expensive set of bose headphones that sound amazing and these are right up there with that quality.  
i'm amazed at how great they sound when i'm at the gym.  
i find the battery life of these to been very good.  
i've used the headphones for several hours over the course of a week
and i still have about 60% battery left.  
note: warning!!
do not use any other charging cable other than the one that come with this device as it could cause battery damage that will prevent the battery from recharging.  
"this is a bit under-stated in the instructions, but it is mentioned to only use the cable that came with the headphones.  "
i use the charging cable that came with the headphones
and i plug it into my pc to charge the headphones.  
if i have one other complaint its that i wish the cord connecting the two ear pieces was round instead of ribbon flat
so it would hang better.  
"but for the price, i really can't complain.  "
i highly recommend these headphones to anyone!
the sound cancelation is really good with the foam tips.
it’s just as good as a certain $80 counterpart
but these actually have a far better bluetooth connection and at a fraction of the price.
the tone isn’t nearly as good as the $80 counterpart.
actually i don’t like the tone much at all
", it’s far too bassy, however; i bought an app called equalizer pro which allows me to throw a completely custom eq curve on items from my music library."
this solves the sound problem: music sounds amazing.
this only works for items from the music library though.
youtube and podcasts will still be on bassy side but at the price point for these headphones
", i’m ok with it."
"the battery lasts a good while, i haven’t measured exactly how long"
but it works well for me.
there maybe better options out there
"but these are pretty good for the price point and with equalizer pro, i’d recommend these."
"i bought these for jogging and working out at the gym, for a second set to have on hand."
the noise canceling is awesome!
"i was a little worried about buying them since i have very small ears for an adult, but the smallest set of buds just made the cut, so"
i’m pretty happy about that too.
but i am very disappointed in the bluetooth range.
with my other set of mpow headphones i can leave my phone in my bag in a cubby
and they almost never cut out.
but with these i have to keep my phone on my me
and they still cut out.
i have to keep the phone on the right side of my body and preferably in front of me to keep signal.
"i also connected the headphones to my fitbit versa, which is on my left wrist and when i swing my arm back while walking the headphones cut out."
this is very frustrating.
i guess leaving my phone in my cubby is out of the question if the range is this short.
"although the sound quality is great when they are working, i would not purchase these again."
i bought the unit just 14 days ago.
it went dead in a middle of a two-hour run.
"no low battery warning, just went silent."
tried recharging and resetting to no avail.
it's probably due to sweat damage.
runners and gym rats beware.
"i don't usually leave negative reviews knowing the potential effect on the seller, but the advertised ipx7 waterproof quality (submersion in 3 ft of water) should not have been this flimsy."
i've also noticed a disturbing trend by quite a few buyers who left unflattering comments and then updated their ratings to glowing reviews without addressing root causes of their problems.
"take notice, amazon."
pros:-connects immediately
"every time-good sound quality (to my untrained ears), great volume-super comfortable and secure, fit well-great battery life, charges super fast-sweet name on your bluetooth (mpow flame 🔥)"
-sick color (red 💥)-easy to keep track of:
no magnet
but you can hook the hear loops together around your neck
", they’re slightly bulkier than earbuds"
"(but still compact), and they're an easily visible color.cons:-small range, sometimes glitches a lil bit if it’s in my back pocket-connects easily and immediately to your friends phones after they use the headphones once"
"(this is actually a pro disguised as a con)in conclusion, 11/10 headphones."
"i’ve gone through a number of comparable bluetooth headphones (which tend to break, have shit battery life, or have terrible sound quality) and these are the best."
buy em.
overall decent headphones so far no issues linking or cutting out.
audio quality is far below what you would hope for.
"one huge design flaw though, the wire drops down out of the front of the earpieces instead of the back."
"this causes the ear pieces to be constantly pulled out of your ear, extremely frustrating."
almost better to let the wire hang below your chin instead of behind your neck.
definitely one more thing to keep an eye out for when picking a new pair of headphones.
"update: good customer service,"
company reached out after initial review and sent me a new pair of headphones.
these are a different style (mpow cheetah).
"they are better than the flames but are very different, the wire connecting them is stiff to make the coil up when not being used."
this i believe is to help hold them in place while using but doesnt feel very natural.
sound quality with the cheetah pair is not great either but good customer service.
moving from 2 stars to 3 solely because of the effort of their customer service.
- sound.
"when it was working, the sound quality was amazing.-bluetooth."
there were some difficulties connecting to the bluetooth even though i literally just turned it off.
"most times, it will indicate that it has connected however, it doesn’t connect to the phone..."
"not sure where it was connected to because it wasnt connected onto my phone.- as for comfortability, it fits very snug onto my ears and very rarely slips off, even through strenuous activities such as running and working out."
i am just very upset that this headset has a lifespan of two to three months.
my issue: i was so fond of these headphones and the price that i told a friend to purchase....
"to my disappointment, her headphones stopped working within two months."
"as for me...after months of working well, i charged it like"
i would normally
"and i noticed it automatically had a blue light, which means fully charged."
so i unplugged it and plugged it again - only for it to turn red (charging) and within 10 seconds it turned blue again.
"i’m assumming this thing has developed rapid charging now, so when i try to turn it on - nothing."
no sound.
no indication that it is connecting to the phone either.
just nothing.
great headset for three months.
i’m hard of hearing and high tone deaf.
i spent a lot of money on bluetooth and could never find one that worked well with my hearing loss.
"i know beats would be amazing and they work, but i want something for the gym swearproof and with comfort and not a hole in the pocket."
"i just got these in, i’m not sure about connection and battery life"
i will test them this week.
"sound wise, the quality is amazing and the bass is superb!"
"i was blown away with these little guys because i’m always set up for disappointment when coming to headphones in general, aside from my iphone headphones."
i was extremely happy with these that i purchased another pair!
may not be the best of best
but it’s pretty close enough for me!
it also drowns our noise in background and i’m content with them.
they deserve 5 stars!
*update
*
"i didn't contact the seller at all to get replacements, because it was right at the warranty date, plus i didn't want to go through all the trouble of sending back a $16 paid of headphones, but the seller saw my review, and sent a brand new pair of headphones to me without me even asking."
that is very good customer service right there.
have been using the new ones and have had no issues with them thus far.
i changed my review from two stars to four stars based on this.
well they were ok at first.
"decent battery life, audio quality was pretty good, but about a month and a half after my purchase they died."
just powered off in the middle of using them.
"no low battery warning, and they had just been charged the previous day."
"tried powering them back on, but nothing."
thought maybe they didn't get charged
all the way so went and charged them when i got home.
"the red indicator light showing that it is charging did not come on, and after charging for a little while they still would not even power on."
they are dead.
"also another weird thing is they would cut in and out from time to time, like it was trying to connect to other devices, or other devices to them."
would happen more often if there were more people closer in proximity to me.
i guess you could buy these if you wanted headphones that will die shortly after buying them.
"yeah, so i picked these up for $20, not expecting much."
i got much!setup is easy
(i bought them to use with a laptop that has horrible speakers)
", they sound good, and they get pretty loud."
they're pretty comfortable and have a good range.
i can wander the 25 feet or so to get a beer from the fridge
and they're still plugging away.
there are two things that kind of bug me:  
the *
really*
short charge cable
"(it's just microusb, but don't feed it any more than 5v) and the flat cable running between them."
i'd have preferred a round cable as they're easier to curl up and stay how you want them to.
aside from that?
totally worth the $20.
i'll comment back in the battery life if it's not good.
"been going for about an hour from the out-of-the-box charge, so that's nabad."
i had high hopes for these mpow wireless earbuds.  
"if i'm holding my phone in front of me (a google pixel xl) while streaming to the earbuds, the sound quality is great.  "
"if i put my phone in my back pocket while i'm walking to/from the train, the audio is garbage--constantly cuts in and out.  "
my partner has a pair of jlab
audio jbuds pro
--so i returned these and gave those a try.  
much much better.  
"phone in back pocket while walking, and no audio cut out."
"amazon was great, though, i must say.  "
they replaced my original purchase with an identical pair to see if that made the difference.  
"unfortunately, it didn't.  "
so i went with the jlab audio jbuds pro instead
and i'm much happier now.
it picked up background noise.
no one could actually hear​ me talking.
i purchased these headphones to use during my running workouts.  
"i had some initial problems, however, these were quickly resolved by the seller patozon customer service team.  "
they responded quickly and efficiently.  
i would recommend them to anyone thinking about buying these headphones.
the headphones work very good.  
the sound is very nice and crisp.  
the bass is good.  
"i really love being able to run ""wire"" free and these headphones are sturdy and nicely priced.  "
the bluetooth is very easy to pair with you phone or mp3 player.  
it literally took me about 5 minutes to get them working.  
the right side
ear
bud has all the controls for the unit (power / volume / pause / play / skip track) and the charging port.  
the unit also comes with a usb charging cord.
"all in all, a great unit for the price.  "
i would recommend it.  
thanks for reading
sound quality is great if the headset has line of site of my phone.
if my phone goes into the convenient pocket on my hip the quality drops to staticy at best.
"battery life is good, charges in 30 minutes or so."
normal terrible bluetooth microphone that sounds like you are in the bathroom while taking a call.
if you will be playing on the phone while listening to music
it's great.
but if you plan on running with the phone in a pocket i would look elsewhere.**update

"i have now had the headphones for 1 year, the headphones are almost completely broken, the audio in the left headset keeps cutting in and out, called someone earlier"
and they couldn't hear me until i took the call off bluetooth.
"if you want cheap okay quality these are not terrible, i use them probably 30hrs a week"
the sound of the headphones when sitting at my desk is really nice.  
"the problem is that i purchased these for my long morning runs, up to 2 hours.  "
"what i first noticed when i would run is that after about a mile of good sound i started having issues with cracking, gaping and poping.  "
"it got so bad one morning that i just turned off the music and ran in silence, not fun.  "
"so i don't use them for running anymore, just listening at my desk.  "
my other issue is with the battery.  
today i turned them on and my phone said mpow 70%.  
"in 10 minutes i got the warning, ""battery low"".  "
when this happens my phone shows 30%.  
"what is the most frustrating is that once i get the battery low warning, the headphones shut off in 4 minutes.  "
i don't think i have gotten more than 3-4 hours out of any charge.  
i do love the voice updates.  
"whether ""power on"", ""power off"" or ""connected"", everything is clear and you know the status.  "
"no guessing, did it beep once or twice or was that a long or short tone?  "
definitely the best feature.
if you want to sit and listen to music this is a nice set of headphones for the price.  
"but being advertised for sport, they fall way short of fulfilling that aspect."
i am a bargain shopper and a cheapo.
i know the game
so i bought these cause they seemed to be legit and the reviews seemed good plus they look like beats by dre.
lol
anyways i run and workout 5 days a week
and these have held up so far.
they come with extra silicone ear things which is a plus cause if you actually wear these to work out and
u sweat
then u will need to replace the ear silicone parts.
the case is cool too.i would say it's a must have
and if you are buying these for working out dont spend your money on $$$ ear phones
these are where it's at.trust me.
it syncs with my bluetooth very fast.
faster than any other wireless ear phones i had previous to this.
i was skeptical of a less expensive bluetooth earbud and was happily surprised.
amazon shipped them a day earlier than originally acknowledged.
even around a couple huge cnc machines the noise cancelling technology works well.
"there are three sizes of ear inserts, they should fit just about any ear size perfectly."
the compact design is functional and easy to learn.
they did pair easily and quickly to my galaxy s8+.
setup might have been 15 seconds
and i had tunes bumping.
the sound quality is great!
i have to be mindful of how high i crank the tunes.
"can't wait to fly again, that'll be the acid test."
i'm sure these earbuds will work excellently in that application as well.  
and all of this for < $20?
"i bought two pair, one for my wife as well."
"these are her first bluetooth earbuds, she loves hers as well.  "
wish i would have bought an additional pair for when these are worn out :)
"no question, quality and battery life is great."
connecting to phone/ mac / tv was super easy.
buttons are placed where it should be.
over all design is great.
the problem starts in listening mode.
"it feels like dropping connection or lowering volume or some kind of disturbance  after every few seconds, nearly every 4-8 seconds."
i switched connection to phone/mac/tv but everywhere its the same trouble.
reviews are very good
so may be
i have lemon product.
"regardless, i will be returning the product."

i returned the product and got replacement after 2 weeks.
so far the headset is working fine.
the only complaint is not holding charge for more than 4-5 hours.
i am bumping up the stars to 3 due to this reason.
if you are not a discriminating audiophile you will not notice that the sound on these is bad.
"too much bass, sounds seems that are produced deep within a tin can, the high frequencies are attenuated."
i constantly seek to readjust the highs and lows to no avail.
i guess for the price $20 they are okay earphones.
my jabra earphones broke and i wanted another pair that would not fall off.
these are exceptionally snug and do not fall off.
the right ear on/off
"switch location requires some getting use to and acquainting to, since it is prone to be unintentionally turned off while adjusting it to your ears."
"i did not think the sound would be an issue for me, i thought a well balanced earphone would be a std."
product
but i guess i was wrong.
would not recommend these.
it connects to my phone fast and everything else is great.
bought them looking for inexpensive noise canceling bluetooth headphones.
turned out to be the best pair i have ever owned!
my wife bought the newer generation and loves them as well.
i can easily get 7-8 hours per charge!
great for the gym as they don’t fall out of my ears while on treadmill or elliptical.
"won’t buy any other brand from now on , these are reasonably priced and have great sound quality!"
and i have owned beats
"i get it, but i can’t be dropping $100 every time i lose a pair or the dog chews them up!"
i paid $17 with a discount wish i had bought more!
i purchased these headphones after about a year of working through several pairs of an expensive high end pair that i supported on kickstarter (zip buds 26).
this pair was several times cheaper
and i never had an issue in malfunctions due to sweating.
"i use them a lot...on my daily walks, occasionally on a bike ride, car rides, etc."
just recently i am noticing that a connection is malfunctioning so the left ear cuts in and out regularly depending on the position of the cord.
"but, i got almost a year out of them compared to the few months (multiple times) that i had experienced with the ""high end"" buds, and at this price, i don't mind buying another pair every so often."
"it would be nice to get a pair to last longer than a year, but again, i use them a lot."
i purchased these almost a year ago and they still work great.
"i use them almost daily for 1 1/2 - 2 hours at a time and recharge them every other day, to make sure they're always ready to go."
"the battery has only died on me one time and that was upon initial use, right out of the package."
"they pair quickly, the sound is great, and all the features (next, last song, volume) work as described."
"the microphone also works well, accept in very windy conditions, which is to be expected."
i wish the ear piece was adjustable because they are just a tad big.
"other than that, i would purchase these again."
"overall, extremely delighted with these!so after going through a few lg tones, i decided that i didn't want to shell out for another pair."
"i found these while searching, my first impression when looking online was not super high as i hadn't heard of the brand before"
and they looked low quality.
"but i figured for the cost, i would try them out."
"when i received them, the presentation was much higher than i expected"
(i anticipated a clear bag and this definitely not the case).
it looked like some of the more expensive brands.
"after opening, the experience was still ""high quantity"" everything neatly packaged and professionally presented."
"pairing, opperating and charging are exactly like i would expect from any other brand."
"the sound however, i'm no audiophile, but i have had lg tones for a few years now and have been happy with the sound quality, but also paid for that quanlity i felt."
"when i purchased these, i didn't expect much i just wanted to be able to hear, and they do allow me to hear as expected."
what i didn't expect was to pay 1/4 the cost of the tones and get twice as better sound from them
(the music feels right
vs just loud).
"these are my first set of ""wireless"" headphones"
and i'm fairly satisfied.  
the sound quality is slightly better than the traditional earbuds i usually use.
"however, i did find that the quality is not consistent over the course of a listen.  "
"the volume would go very slightly muffled, and then become clear again for no apparent reason.  "
this has happened several times now.  
"it doesn't bother me too much since it's only a slight change, but it's something to note.  "
i have also noticed that there is something interrupting the wireless connection between the headphones and my smart phone.  
"this causes the song to essentially sound like it's ""skipping"""
like i'm listening to a cd on a discman.  
this happened the first couple of times of using the headphones and hasn't recurred since.  
"at the time, i had my smart phone in my pocket while walking."
"i found that this didn't happen while holding my phone in my hands, but it's hard to say whether this is what prevented the issue.  "
i also have a slightly silly gripe about the wires that connects each of the earbuds.  
i found it to be too long for my liking and would get bunched up in the back of my neck.  
i had to use wire ties to bundle the excess wire to shorten it and keep it neat.  
"another slightly silly gripe - i got these headphones as a gift, and when i saw that the box indicated wireless headphones, i was expecting something completely wireless, but alas this particular headphone does indeed involve wires.  "
"i guess as far as wireless headphones go, it qualifies, but that kind of bummed me out.  "
"for the most part, the wires, once bundled, does not bother me too much.  "
the over-ear handles do help the headphones to stay snug in your ears during all manner of activity (which is great since i've been using them mostly on my walks and jogs) and they are fairly comfortable throughout each use.  
appearance could be improved.  
it's not the sleekest and reminds me of those corny bluetooth
"ear sets that people use for placing calls, but once worn, they are discreet enough.  "
i also wish they had more colors to choose from!  
"but ultimately, in spite of these minor gripes, i am satisfied with the headphones.  "
"the price is affordable and the quality is good, and i love not having long wires to tangle up with my arms or jacket or having to unfurl wires like with the traditional earbuds.  "
i haven't had to charge them since getting them two weeks ago so battery life appears great.
"since i got these as a gift, i'm not sure i would purchase it independently, due to the minor faults described above and due to personal preferences, but i would say it's a pretty solid purchase otherwise.  "
i don't think anyone would be too disappointed with them.
"for the price you pay for these, i'd say they are a great value.  "
they last a very long time.
i've been using the same pair for a year now and the only thing that needed replacement was the covers.  
"the sponge ones broke so i've started using the plastic covers, which are still very comfortable."
i use these when i go to the gym and when i go running.  
they are sweat-proof and the quality of sound is quite good.
it's got a strong bass (which i appreciate on my runs) and the volume capacity is more than you need.  
i usually set it somewhere
between 60-75% of max volume.
i've never had issues with the bluetooth connection
so that's a plus.
the charge lasts quite a long time as well - i charge them maybe once a week
and i use them 3-5 times a week (30min-75min each time).
so we're talking about 4-5 hours of usage before i need to charge it again.
"overall, i'm pleasantly happy with these and would recommend them to anyone look for a set of mid-tier headphones at an affordable price point."
"i've had this bluetooth headset for 2 months now, i'm not a connoisseur of earbuds"
", however i feel that the music quality is decent."
"battery life is pretty good, takes about 1 1/2 hours to charge fully and lasts through my work day."
"you're given a case, includes the usb cord, a variety of earbuds (sizes/style), even something for the earbud cord, as it's not considered truly wireless."
i can go through a pretty good distance in my office without the music cutting out.
my biggest complaint is that the wire that goes behind your neck shifts and will gradually pull out the earbud or loosen it.
"also, after awhile your ears may feel sore, but that didn't bother me too much."
"bottom line, i'd buy these again"
and i'd buy them as a gift.****updated review

"i loved these headphones, however as of today 09/25/19, they have stopped working."
"it'll turn on after fully charging, then shut off completely."
no words can express how sad i am that that no longer work!
took one star away because they only lasted 6 months.
"otherwise, they are still decent bluetooth headphones, but still have room for improvement."
"the headphones are well made, look good, the blue tooth connectivity is excellent, the battery life is about 4 hours.  "
easy to recharge and
good carry case.  
i like the turn on/off announcement and
the volume control is easy to access.
the 4 stars is because i have a difficult time trying to wear them...
the covers provided are all too large to fit inside my ear and the piece that wraps around the ear is very uncomfortable and it is not adjustable.  
"i only use it when streaming shows from my pc, now way i could use it for music."
my son-in-law has the same set and they fit him well and he loves them.  
small ears beware :>)
"for the price, these are pretty good."
"i just upgraded from some standard apple earpods that died, needed something for casual everyday use and exercising."
"these are my first wireless earbuds, looking forward to my new wire-free life."
"i've had beats headphones and earbuds in the past (personally, their build is crap, they break apart easily."
"sigh, anyways..)"
and these sound close enough but not quite there of course.
or these wouldn't be $20.the correct buds size is crucial for quality of sound.
"changed the buds it came in, huge difference."
"changing the buds is tricky, you have to be pretty gentle and meticulous"
cause they're attached right at the speakers(?)
snugly
and it's a tiny knub.
i was afraid of breaking the area if i used too much strength.
"the memory foam buds sadly are too big for me and distort the music in my ear canal, wish there were different sizes of those."
"the design is highly functional and comfortable, been wearing these for hours."
"so flexible too, i can take 'em off my ears effortlessly."
"there is little bass in these, i don't know why some people say the bass in these is great; it's not that pronounced, but i wasn't depending on it"
cause i don't like too much bass.
"not really noise cancelling, good noise isolation tho."
"good enough to hear my music in depth and still know what's happening around my surroundings faintly, which is important for me when i go out to jog."
"i'm not an expert on audio, so i can't discern highs, mids, and lows well"
but i think the highs are best.
was able to hear new details in songs i've been listening to for years.
i've been testing different music genres and they all sound pretty good
", tho drums in rock are lacking a bit (sad)."
my pop and electronic music sounds amazing probably due to a bit of bass.
"the volume on these can go quite high, i listen at half volume"
and it's pretty loud.
"initial pairing set up took like 25 seconds, after the initial pair they connect super fast automatically (like 2-3 seconds) when i turn the mpows on."
"using these with my motorola e5 plus, haven't tried pairing my macbook yet."
"stays connected at a good distance, our house is mostly concrete so when i have two walls between my phone and i, it starts to cut off or buffer; which is logical."
"tested the microphone quality with my sister calling me, she said i sounded a bit far away"
but she still heard me clearly.
"the siri/google assistant function works well, i have to talk a bit louder than normal cause"
"like i said,"
i sound a bit far away so my google assistant misinterpreted some things.
"the instructions in the box are straightforward and clear, memorized the button functions in like 3 mins."
"i mainly chose these mpows over other brand wireless earbuds, cause i can skip songs on these."
thank youu.
so far the charge is pretty good.
lasts many hours.
i wish i could know
how much charge is left on these.
"on the box, it says you can't charge with more than a 5v usb port, so keeping that in mind."
"i had some bluetooth speakers recently (different brands) and i noticed they died quickly, charging issues."
i guess it's common amongst bluetooth tech.
"hopefully, these will last..."
long enough.
i will update this review if anything happens.
"i did not receive these for free, i bought these with my money."
"first impression so far, worth it."
i bought these headphones so my daughter and i could start working out together and listen to our own music without drowning each other out.
"they worked great for the first few uses, but in the last month and a half have become junk."
at first they paired easily with my s8
+
and i got great sound out of them.
they seemed durable and i was hoping they would last for a little while.
"lately though when listening to anything, movies, music, or just quick videos, they play like a skipping cd."
"if i am completely still and not moving, i get good sound, but the minute i move, static and skipping."
"i cannot use them to listen to music while i ride my bike, workout, or even cut the grass."
"they have went downhill, and fast."

update:
i contacted the seller after leaving my review and they got back to me
nearly immediate.y
"they sent out a replacement, which showed up two days later."
as of right now i'm happy with this product despite the inconvenience.
"i hope this pair will last much longer than the first pair, and will update this review again if they die prematurely."
"i purchased this on july 7th, 2018, and am writing this review on september 3rd, 2018."
"i was very happy with these headphones until this morning, when they wouldn't turn on."
"they had been nearly fully charged, but i tried to charge them again just to make sure they hadn't drained somehow."
no dice.
"the light will just barely flash blue sometimes when i try to turn them on, but that's it."
i'm contacting the seller to see if they'll do anything and will update this review if they do.
i purchased these in
"may. they're a bit too bass-heavy for my personal liking, but that's easily adjustable with the apps that i use to listen to music."
they're very comfortable and i've worn them for long runs without a problem and the battery lasts a long time.
however.
"two days ago, they stopped working."
the sound started cutting in and out
and then it just didnt cut in again.
"when the battery is going to die, the headset gives you ample warning."
this time i didn't get any warnings.
i tried charging it but the light didn't even come on to indicate that it was charging.
"over all for the price and sound, it's well worth giving them a shot."
i'm just disappointed in the lifespan of the product.
edit:
patozon had sent a replacement set and they work well too.
i won't test the sweatproof nature of these
i purchased 2 times and had the same experience.  
first set i bought didn't work at all
but i received a replacement  which worked so well i purchased an additional set
so i would have back up when 1st set was charging.  
"both sets died after 3-4 months of very light, occasional use.  "
"so...that is 3 sets of earphones, all failed."
i had the same exact experience with  otium  earphones.  
i think both brands must be made by same company because except for logo and carry case they look & operate exactly the same and have the same headache.
if you read the other 1 star reviews you will see many others with same complaint.
"headphones look great, but the soft behind-the-ear piece is...too large and ""flimsy"", so while running/working out, they tend to come off/bend off and it becomes annoying to having them fall and and stop your workout to put them back on."
"sound, pairing, and"
"other functions are great, just that the fit is too large for my ear."
"i'm not sure if they make a smaller ""over the ear"" bit*update*changed from 3 to 5 stars."
i received a better set of headphones (mpow cheetag) for working out and more solid fit for my style of workouts (cardio/biking).
i'd like to say their customer service is the best i've seen on amazon
and i've been ordering from amazon for over 7 years.
great work ethic and attention to customer feedback.
so far i'm really liking these headphones.
pretty good battery life.  
nice light weight and doesn't slip out of your ears when you sweat.  
the sound quality is good still lacking in the bass area
but i guess it's probably next to impossible to get a heavy bass response with any small headset.  
the additional ear pieces that you can switch out for a better fit and a pretty durable case makes this a headphone set i would order again if i were to lose these.
i've been a big fan of over the ear type headphones
but i've recently gotten into running and was looking for something less bulky and easier to run with.
easy to setup with my
galaxy s8 phonevery comfortable in my ear with no movement when running even when getting really sweatygood sound for what i need to workout and run.
music is clear...just enough volume to get lost in the music when running but also hear anything around you.
battery life so far is great - i can go a full week of working out everyday before needing to charge again.
ended up buying two more for my kids to use for playing on their nintendo switch
this review is taking into account the very low price of these headphones.  
i bought the flames after breaking my $120 lg's
"so my expectations weren't great, but i was pleasently suprised by the excellent build and sound quality.  "
i've never heard better sounding wireless headphones anywhere near this price point.
"the flames are solidly built, and have held up to several weeks of daily outdoor use with no issues."
i have used them in wet and cold conditions and they have had no problems.
"while i do recommend these headphones for the price, i do have a couple"
issues.1.
the battery life is not very good.
the flames will frequently only last a few hours before needing to be recharged.  
they also don't give a low battery warning until a couple minutes before they die.  
"this may not be an issue for some people, but for people who use them all day in the field like me it can be a bit"
annoying.2.
they are not comfortable at first.
"the flame comes with 3 earbud sizes, but even after installing the right one, they we're stiff and uncomfortable at first."
the earpiece and the way they rested on my ear we're also quite uncomfortable at first.
ymmv
but it took a while for my ears to adjust and the tips to break in before they were comfortable to wear for long periods.
"overall a great value product, that competes with much more expensive options, but don't expect professional quality at this price"
update*
*
customer service reached out and sent a different pair which works great.
the fit is a little different from this model but the bass is much richer.
sound quality improved a bit from the last model and for these price range of headphones
"i didn’t expect much to begin with but these new ones are great!decent headphones for the price, don’t really stay in your ear too well and the battery life isn’t so great"
but i had these for a little over a year now
and they’ve done just fine at the gym and in the sauna.
really annoying having them keep popping out of your ear
and the battery life is annoying.
gotta charge them every night but the sound quality is decent
okay
so the reason i gave this product
a 2 star is because i used them for about a month or so and all of sudden
they stopped working...
the bluetooth would not connect to the phone at first so after a few trys
i was able to connect it to the phone finally
but after that i could only hear sound from the right aide of earphones...
currently i am unable to connect them to my phone again
"so i cannot use them at all..update: july 9 ,"
2018the seller contacted me and sent me a new pair for free and they have worked so far... hopefully they will keep working for a long time.
thanks for the awesome customer service...
i just wrote an honest review and they reached out to help me with my problem.
i really did not expect the seller to even look at the review i wrote.
"i've owned bose, sony, beats, and other high end bluetooth headphones."
i have thr mpow over the ears (which are hands down the most comfy headsets i've ever owned) and love them.
"because i like my over the ears, i decided to try the buds."
"buds are usually a disaster for me because they're always too big, they hurt, and never stay in."
not so with the mpow!
"the smallest pads fit wonderfully, i can run and they dont fall out and they are very comfortable!i typically listen to.podcasts and sometimes music."
"the sound quality is a solid ""good"" compared to more expensive buds.. for the price you're paying for mpow..."
the sound is excellent.
i'd definitely buy all my mpows again.
"(and they came with a nice little case too, which is great!)"
they hurt my ears after awhile ( 4 hours or so).
i started alternating ears which somewhat negates the benefits of not having something hanging down.
they hang a little heavy too.
"i wish the battery lasted for 12 hrs rather than 8, because i work 12 hr shifts."
but i was pleased to get a full 8 hours without having to be careful.
the sound quality is great and they are easy to use.
"imo, the sound quality is on par with regular apple earphones that come with your phone.  "
i think the reason they get uncomfortable is because they create a good seal which really improves sound quality.  
overall these are a big improvement over regular earphones.
and the price is amazing for what you get.
i will definitely buy again.
i was really a fan of these headphones at first.
they fit comfortably in my ears and the sound quality was really quite good!
"however, after a few months the sound quality became full of static and the sound kept cutting out on the left ear bud."
upon hearing my concerns the company got in touch with me and agreed to replace my pair.
i have received my new pair in the mail and am so happy to have these earphones again.
i'm glad i bought these and am excited to continue using them!
"everything works well with the headphones, great deal for the price."
"but, i use these headphones for working out.  "
the flat cable has a tendency to stick on your skin and tugs the headphone out of your ear.  
"this was a big deal for me, i couldn't concentrate on my work out since i was constantly adjusting the cable that was sticking on my neck."
"maybe a rounded cable would minimize this issue?no sweat, not sticky.  "
so headphones are good at the office only...
update - 5/14/2018i'm going to update my review and give this product a 5 star.  
i was routing the cable incorrectly while using them and was causing the cable to stick to my skin when i exercised.  
"once i let the cable simply fall underneath my chin as intended, everything worked great!"
"really wanted to like these, but the first ones i got wouldn't charge after two weeks of owning them."
"i returned them and got a new pair, and now three weeks later this pair has died as well."
"i'd give them one star, but my son has a pair that has worked fine for about three months now, so maybe i just got unlucky?"
sound quality was excellent when they worked.3/8/18 edit:
"after posting this review, a representative from the company got in touch and has offered to send out a replacement pair for me to try again."
"i appreciate the good service on this, and since our son's headphones have yet to experience problems, i've upgraded the review from 2 stars to 3 stars."
i'll update this again after i give the replacement pair of headphones some use.8/8/18 update: upgrading from 3 stars to 4 stars.
"well, five months on now and the replacement headphones i got from the company are working fine, and my son's are still holding up too."
so i'm going to attribute my first two bad pairs to bad luck.
i also appreciate the company's great service in trying to make things right for me.
let me get the bad out of the way (even though technically it is not a bad).the only hiccup that i've had so far with these headphones
is it took a couple of times to set up pairing these headphones with my phone.
that is the one simple complaint that i have.
now the positives (which are many)it's a small thing
but i really enjoy the fact when a number calls in the software
allows the number to be read.
"this may be a small thing, and something that is possibly done by more expensive headphones."
this is my third pair of wireless headphones and the first that i have noticed that does this.
sound:
the sound is clear and precise.
calls sound clear and the music is crisp.
i'm sure more audio smart people could speak in a scientific way to explain sound quality.
"all i know is that the highs, lows, and bass all come through with this headset."
comfort:
as long as you don't mind your headphones sticking out a little you should be good.
"each persons ear canal is like a snowflake, but i was able to find a pair of buds that fit my ear."
overall
:for the money you can't beat these headsets.
if i had a need to have more than one pair i would definitely buy another set.
"some people didn't like the over the ear hook, but i didn't even notice it was there once i started wearing them."
"plus, the plastic is soft enough where it doesn't start to irritate or bother my ear."
if you want a pair of headphones to use daily and at the gym
i highly recommend these.
i don't understand the design of these headphones.
they are super uncomfortable to wear.
there is a large plastic circle just before the ear bud that squashes the inside of my ear.
i can't keep them in for very long because of how much they make my ears ache.
very disappointed and wish i had been able to return them.
edit
: the seller responded to my review and generously mailed me a different pair of their wireless headphones.
the new ones definitely were more comfortable and had a tighter fit.
"my issue with them is that i wear glasses, and the plastic of the headphones rubs against them and makes a constant very distracting ""heartbeat"" type noise every time i move my head."
"i'll continue to try them, but they seem like ones i will only wear without glasses on."
these don’t work.
"i opened the box, charged the headphones with a usb charger, and when i tried to power them up, nothing happened."
the 8 page instruction booklet reads like it was written by a computer in another language and translated by a bad copy of google translate.
it barely makes sense.
everything about this product and its packaging makes me wonder if intelligent humans had any part in the production.
"3 pages on correct disposal of product and an fcc statement, translation in 6 languages, horrible grammar, more typos than i’ve ever seen in a product manual, and nothing about how long they need to be charged."
how can people actually think it’s acceptable to put such an unprofessionally-produced product on the market?
everything about this product is disappointing.
i've purchased numerous wireless bluetooth headsets over the years.
some fit good but sounded inferior.
some sounded good but persistently fell out of my ears.
the mpow flame bluetooth headphones fit great (had to change to a different [included] ear pad) and sound great.
they don't fall out when i turn my head during a workout or when actively moving around.
the cost is very reasonable.
they come with various ear fittings and a carry case
(case could be a little bigger).
"i enjoy them so much that after i ran over my first pair (yes, that will break them)"
i ordered 2 more pair and gave one set to a friend who was struggling to find a quality set of wireless headphones.
these headphones are excellent !  
i use them most of the day for the phone but also for running and working out.
"i typically wear out a set of headphones about every 6 months, so over the last 4-5 years i have been through a lot of different brands and models including expensive brand names."
these sound very good and are well made.  
the bluetooth works about 50 ft and the ear material is very comfortable to run in.
i have not had them long enough to see how they will hold up
but i expect it will be fine.
the best part they are only a fraction of the cost of comparable products.
"bought it june 8, and suddenly on aug 9 it stopped working."
like it won’t charge at all and it won’t turn on either.
it didn’t got wet
", it was just fine the night before and put it on my nightstand before going to bed and the next morning it was dead and won’t charged!!!"
"today, before writing this review we tried to charge it again and to no avail."
waste of money.
i would like to return if possible!update: 08/22/2018seller
sent me a new item to replace the one that stopped working.
"my husband liked it before it broke, and i bought a different headphone to replace it"
but he did not like the sound quality of the different brand.
he is very appreciative that they gave us a replacement.
he is using it right now.
thank you.
good customer service.
update:
i feel a lot better about the replacements
"(i've had them aboit a week now), i can now get just under the 10m distance that's stated before it starts to sound like static."
and i can now bend towards the ground withouth them messing up.
"the ear part still bugs, but i have smaller ears"
so it's expected.
"overall, they're recommended."
add on
: the company's customer service is spectacular so far.
"they are actually working on getting me a new one right now, so i will update as soon as i receive it!"
😊original review
:they work fine as long as your device is right next to you.
"even being five feet away causes them to cut out, which defeats the purpose of bluetooth devices."
the part that fits behind the ear is made for people with dumbo sized ears since it isn't adjustable.
i still use them even.
so good enough for now.
they were a breeze to get set up.
i’ve owned at least 6 pairs of bt buds and was generally disappointed in the max volume.
this set is loud.
i ordered at 8pm on 5-23; got delivery on 5-24(today) about 2pm.
"i went online to order another and they’re sold out, unknown if will be back in stock."
if they’re available for a good price(i paid about $16.00) pick them up.
don’t know
"if it’s a faulty algorithm, but amazon had a similar headset( though probably a better features model) by mpow today for sale by amazon for $1008.07."
the era of cheap chinese electronics may be over.
or jeff bezos may know something.
good buy for 20 bucks.
pairs quickly and easily.
fit is a tad finicky.
sound is surprisingly decent for blue tooth iem's on the low end of the price scale.
"but be warned, it's a bass monster."
i would have probably sent them back if i didn't have a music player on my phone with adjustable eq.
"i guess if you like loud, overpowering, bloated bass like, say, beats, then you'll probably like them fine without eq.edit:"
the sound is still decent but boomy.
the fit is rather fussy
but luckily i found some tips in my vast tip collection that help (otherwise i was going to send them back).
the cable cinch is garbage.
doesn't stay on when you try to adjust it on the fly while running or working out.
i bought this for hands free calls and the occasional music.
"i have purchased many ""budget"" blue tooth headsets over the last 6 months and these are hands down my favorite."
the sport style ear loops keep these in place while walking the dog or moving around for work.
i dont use them for working out or running
but i imagine you wouldn't have a problem i have only used the foam ear pieces
so i cant speak for the other included sizes
but they are comfortable and stay in place.
"speaking of whats included, everything comes in a zippered pouch which is definitely a plus in my book."
"i have not seen that with any of the other brands that i have personally purchased, even those which cost double or more."
the only thing that i could ask for is the shirt clip to keep them in place when they are hanging around your neck.
i used one from another set
so it was not a problem for me.
"now on to the sound, they are heavy on the bass side with a little to be desired on the higher notes."
"with that being said, they don't sound bad at all."
"if you like the heavy bass, these should not disappoint."
they sound just fine for calls and the microphone has no problem picking up my voice.
i have not had any problems with connection or dropped calls like i have with some of the other budget models.
i have left the room with my phone on the table and still been able to listen to my music without any issue.
battery life seems to be adequate with about 4 to 5 hours of life before needing a charge.
"all in all, you cant go wrong with these earbuds"
they check all the right boxes for me without breaking the bank.
i would say you get more than you pay for with this set.
"pros- decent battery life, usually around 7-8 hours-"
good sound
quality-
affordable- range of a few yards in my experience.- nice color schemecons- blue light flashes regularly.
"not a problem during the day, but if you plan on using it while trying to sleep, i won't recommend doing so"
if light sensitivity is an issue.- ear hooks aren't adjustable and don't really fit onto the ear.
they just sort of awkwardly dangle above them for the most part.
"they're better used as hooks onto your shirt if you need one ear free.- unusually loud alerts. ""power low"" and ""your headset"
"is connected"" gets blasted in your ear, significantly louder than whatever you're listening to at the moment-"
wear and tear happened rather quickly.
one of the volume buttons got permanently stuck.
"it still worked, but no longer clicked."
one earbud eventually stopped working after a few months because of some failure in the connecting wire.
..durability and reliability is questionable.
this is the second pair of mpow flame bt headphones i've bought.
"unfortunately, the first pair only lasted a month."
i used it everyday while running 3-5 miles on the treadmill and i sweat a lot.
"after charging it for the next use, it wouldn't turn on the next day."
"not sure if sweat got inside causing damage, but it's supposed to be waterproof ipx7 rated.."
"anyway, i tried other similarly priced headphones, but they all sounded shrill or didn't have enough volume."
"some people like their music bright with emphasis on the treble, but if you like your music to sound warm and rich, and want to hear the impact from a heavy bassline or kickdrum, these do satisfy."
i'm not saying these lack treble.
"to me, the highs sound perfectly loud and clear, and the bass that usually isn't there with other headphones is just an added plus with these."
"even though they're advertised as sport waterproof headphones, i can't totally recommend them for long or heavy workouts where they're exposed to a lot of sweat, but if sound is your priority and you prefer music the way i do, these are great and affordable."
there is always a low pitch background humm.
it's annoying.
charges well and fits well enough
", initially the bluetooth pairing was odd because the way they said to pair, by holding the button down until it flashed,  did not work."
but by simply turning the unit on and not continuing to hold the button - i was able to pair.
overall the humming noise is a loser for me
and i would not buy these again.
i bought these over the summer and really enjoyed them while they worked.
they're a good pair of earbuds for the price and the sound quality is good.
after owning them for 7 months the left-side earbud stopped working properly.
it would only play sound intermittently and at certain angles i held my head.
it seemed like something was wrong between the wiring
the connects the left and right set.
i ignored this for a month as i mainly used them for working out
so it wasn't a huge nuisance.
"then recently, the earbuds refuse to turn on."
i've tried charging them
(yes the charging light was on) for hours and holding down the power button for almost a minute.
the only weird thing i can find is that the charging light turned blue after a while
but i'm not sure what that means.
"i never got them super wet from anything like shower, sauna, or rain or dropped them/stepped on them, so i'm not sure what caused this."
overall a pretty good product for the price
but don't expect it to last for a long time.
edit:
i received a replacement pair from the seller.
i have updated my review from 3 to 4 stars.
i am really impressed with customer service from patozon.
it's obvious that they do actually care about the quality of their products and customer satisfaction.
these earbuds are a really good choice for budget wireless earbuds
and i will definitely consider buying a pair again in the future.
i got these in-ear headphones for my ipod classic.  
it comes with a couple extra pairs of plastic earbuds (to replace if they get worn out or dirty).  
the wire seems quite sturdy.  
"however, i noticed how sensitive it is to movement.  "
"the wire noise seems to conduct all the way to the earphones, so i wouldn't recommend these for walking or exercising.  "
"for my purposes though, being mostly stationary, it's not a deal breaker."
the sound quality is much better than my previous apple wired earphones.  
"surprisingly, i'm hearing a lot of instrumentation on songs that i didn't hear before, as if the stereo mix is actually working"
:)  
"with podcasts and audiobooks, the speakers are quite clear.  "
i'm very pleased with how the buds feel in my ear.  
"it's not a hard plastic like with apple, so"
i think i can keep these in for longer.  
"overall, i wanted good sound quality and this fully satisfies."
love the sound.  
i'd buy again.
best i've had n long time.
buy these !!!
for the price these ear buds out perform my $$$ ear buds .
they feel kinda cheap
but you get way more than what you pay for
and it has deep bass
i ordered these headphones to use while drive around for work.
"most headphones are low, these are nice and loud"
also they are easy for me to control with the control buttons.
i will be ordering another pair for my brother.
awesome sound for a great price- highly recommend!
well constructed with angled earpiece for a great fit.
very pleased with this purchase and very good customer service.
it's real nice and loud.
the quality and price are perfect
i like these headphones.
they are comfortable and fit my android just fine.
i can hear and talk clearly.
customer service is superb.
the headphones look great.
no complaints!
the audio is great
and i like the different ear pieces for a comfortable fit
these ear phones are very good in quality
and i definitely recommend
decent value for money
best purchase i ever made!!
!
it is clear and true to the noise canceling!
plug this in and your all set!!
great product!!
so glad i bought these.
"wonderful product,  great sound."
i got these earbuds as  replacements for my old ones and so far i love them; they don't hurt my ears and the sound is good.
i also received them really fast.
i purchased these to use primarily for listening to podcasts when i'm outside doing yard work with noisy lawn care equipment.
not a good use for them.
bass way too intense if volume high and the ability to hear spoken word
fluctuated dramatically if the podcasters vocal volume changed.  
i found myself frequently adjusting the volume up and down on my phone to account for the dramatic fluctuations.
the skull candy earbuds are probably best used for listening to music if ambient noise is at a minimum.
i have another set of earbuds that work better for my intended purpose
(don't know what brand they are) which don't have the dramatic volume fluctuations regardless of the level of ambient noise that is present.
i've tried other earphones but nothing seems to work better with my iphone than my skullcandy  earbuds!
"i can hear others, they can hear me and their really a comfortable fit for my ear."
it's not even worth trying different brands anymore :-)
thanks skullcandy!
"they sound great when they work, but when i bend the wire or turn the jack just a little bit, the sound either fades or goes away completely."
"i just got then today, they did that as soon as i opened them."
"not sure if this is just my pair, or if this has happened to others too."
"otherwise they're very comfortable, and not awful for the price i guess."
easy fit in the ear and great sound for the money...
sound quality comparable to headphones of much higher cost...
you'd have to almost compare to over the ear studio headphones
they're that good...
"it's a great, high quality sound"
very comfortable to wear.
"i liked the color, this brand seems to be more durable than  others i have purchased."
great sound.
fit was perfect
nice bass and stereo sound
great sound for a relatively cheap pair of earbuds.
highly recommend!
"love the olive green color, it's very unique"
"as a long time skull candy user, i expected high quality sound and construction."
this is a very stripped down simple design.
"the colours are unremarkable, the earbuds delicate."
the connecting cord is shorter than i'm accustomed to.
less cord leading from the earbuds to main cord than i'd like.
"all this aside, the sound quality is excellent."
"having trouble getting the bird to stay in my ears, even with the smallest size cushions."
not recommended for those with small ear canals.
"amazon's color description was confusing; took a chance on buying moab red and hoped that they'd actually come in as red (they were pictured as black on amazon when i selected the red color option, super confusing).happy to see that they actually did come in red."
"sound is great, very snug fit --"
basically reduces any outside noise to a barely hearable degree.
"occasionally comes loose during period of long wear, but all i need to do is take them out and put them back in to get another 30 minutes of solid music."
that same great quality we’ve all come to know and love from skull candy.  
very pleased with my purchase.
i've been involved with audio all my life and have some expensive headphones.
"so, i may be spoiled, but these sound horrible."
to me they sounded similar to someone attempting to talk while their hand is over their mouth.
the ones i got suck they sound like a cheap dollar store earbuds and the sounds
fades when the cable bends just terrible
"i will say that i'm one of those people that has a hard time finding earbuds that fit well, but these don't even come close."
they are uncomfortable and fall out.
the sound quality is terrible.
i returned them.
worked worse than the broken earbuds i bought these to replace.
"control button works when it feels like it, and the music cuts in and out based on how insecure the jack’s attachment is at any given moment."
"when swiveled, static abounds."
these earbuds work very well.
my daughter really likes the inline mic and how noise cancelling they are.
we also like the cute color!
expected a lot more out of these.
i’ve owned many pairs of skullcandys and decided to give these ones a try.
overall they sounded up to par and the bass was good.
slightly uncomfortable
and i get static noises intermittently when listening to music which gets quite annoying.
they broke within a week lol.
save your money buy something else
"as always, skullcandy does not disappoint."
excellent sound quality for an affordable price.
they even look snazzy!
bought them for my brother and he loves them.
these are the most durable ear buds i’ve ever owned.
they survived in the washer and dryer unintentionally.
good for the price
"as soon as i got this, the sound didn't work well in one of the buds."
kind of annoying.
"the sound is lacking a bit, it fades in and out, but they work for what i use them for."
they don’t hurt my ears and cancel outside noises.
this product is quite ugly.
the length of the cord is too short for my comfort.
"i love this brands other (discontinued) models, so i was disappointed with this purchase."
"that said, it works."
sound is great!  
soft and good fit!  
comfortable!  
noise canceling!
i've had these for a month and so far i'm really happy with them.
very comfortable and good sound quality
great sound.
great bass.
great quality 💕💕
decided to purchase these and well worth the money
"i purchased these earbuds because the ones i had at the time, had stopped working."
"however, when i received them, they were delivered to the wrong house!"
"onto of that, the item was damaged."
"the sound was only coming from the left ear, and there was a lot of static to it."
"as a long time fan of this company, i was highly disappointed. :("
"excellent sound, very comfortable."
great sound for small price
"they are okay, serve the purpose."
perfect for my son and what he needed them for.
i have small ears and sometimes its just hard to keep them in my ear.
other than that they are great.
i would buy another just for work.
good
good
arrived late but it works.
these have good soundquality.
my favorite  uet
very lightweight with great sound.
love them!
this is the only brand i buy.
the bass is amazing!
use these daily for my audiobook listening
the only kind my son will use.
"good quality for the price, is very comfy."
good quality.
nice fit for smaller ears
stopped working after less than 2 months of use.
they are great and really keep out the noise
love 'em.
sound is tinny; lacks bass.
the sound is amazing
fell apart after 2 uses...very low quality.
excellent buy
work good.
big thumb.
i've been buying inkd for about 10years now.
"i get a new pair every year or two, but i think i'm done now."
here's my break down.
pros-
great thick sound-
very comfortable due to being so light.
cons- shorter wire-
no mic-less
option-
"no protection at the headphone plug, these are going to die quick.-"
very tangly wire-
short wire compared to old inkdthe cons here are why i didn't buy the other no name brands.
these feel like the old skullcandy jib headphones that were junk.
"these sound better, but still feel inferior in almost every way to previous iterations."
the sound quality for the price is unsurpassed...
i only gave it a 4 star because they're late in arriving not anything else otherwise 5
wonderful headphones!
i had a $70 pair from a different brand that stopped working in 10 months
and i needed a quick replacement.
"these sound just as good, if not better than my more expensive pair, and they're a great price."
"they're really comfortable, too!"
"always been a big fan of skullcandy, they always deliver and rarely disappoint."
"the product works as intended, it has a good volume, did not break as soon as i took it out of the box, more of a maroon than a red."
these are the best earbuds i've ever had.
no doubt about it 100% worth the price
the coating of the cable is intentionally made of sticky rubber which gets stuck everywhere.
"as a result, the connection between the earbuds and the cable break easily."
and the customer needs to make another purchase.
very good voice and mic quality
"also material are really good, very recommended"
i've had these for a month and so far i'm really happy with them.
very comfortable and good sound quality
nice bass and stereo sound
"they sound clear, easy to use."
i personally love skull candy.
not much else to say but that they’re amazing.
i love the color too!
i wanted to test them before i left a review.
i'm so happy with this purchase.
i leave these on all day
and i wear glasses.
they are so comfortable on my ears with my glasses too.
great sound and love the noise cancellation.
bought a pair for two relatives and they love their gift.
i bought an extra pair to switch when the other one needs charging.
i can watch tv or listen to music
and i don't have to disturb others.
if anyone has roku and the roku app on their phone with the headphones button on the roku app.
"just pair your headphones with bluetooth on your phone, open the roku app on your phone, tap on remote, tap on headphone icon and enjoy late night movies without disturbing others."
i don't even plug headphones into the roku remote anymore.  
you can watch any app you have downloaded on your roku and listen wireless with these headphones.  
the movie/show pauses when a call comes through.
if it's a short call it resumes and if it's a long call you may have to use the roku remote to resume play.
i workout with these headphones too.
so glad i don't have to keep pushing them in my ear or worry about them falling out.
i did not expect this from the price i paid for these headphones.
i may update this later in six months.
my dr wired headphones last for years.
this is my first pair of wireless bluetooth headphones.
hopefully these will last too.
"the idea that a bluetooth headphone offered really great sound and noise cancelling capabilities for just $20 usd was simply ridiculous a couple of years ago, i’m completely satisfied with this product, so far everything is great."
they are really comfortable; the design is so that sometimes you forget you are even wearing them.
it comes with 3 earbud sizes and finding the right fit is perhaps the most important task you need to accomplish if you wish to get your headphones full potential.  
an inappropriate fit will lessen the sound and noise cancelling features
but of course this in only logical.
"i’ve used them running, riding a bike and also while at office work.  "
"another great thing i didn’t except at all was the microphone quality, i don't like speaking loud when on a call, so far everyone listens to me just fine."
voice activating commands availability is great and also the possibility to pair a second device is nice.
so overall i’m pretty happy with this product
", i’m even giving them as presents to close friends this christmas."
update:
"so after posting the review below, i was contacted by their customer support."
they suggested that the pair i received may have had a manufacturing flaw and sent me a new pair free of charge after i had returned the original pair.
"i really didn't think it would change anything, but to my great surprise, they actually did fit into my ears and make a seal."
i did have to tilt them way up and work them in before moving the straps over my ears
so it takes a bit of maneuvering for me.
"giving them another test run, i found with the proper fit, the sound quality greatly improved."
"for my ears though, they still slip partially out when moving around and have to be adjusted frequently during workouts."
"the back of my ears get a bit sore after about 90 mins of use, due to the tension of the ear strap."
i still found the cord to look much more flimsy than in the picture.
"however, for the price, these things work pretty well."
"casually sitting at my desk, i don't have to adjust them quite as frequently, and the battery life is decent."
"in addition, i greatly appreciate the customer support.  "
for all those reasons i did increase my rating.  
"i'd say the new pair is about 3 stars, but the customer support raises it another 1 star for me."
original review
":i purchased several similar wireless headphones (details below) trying to find a pair that would stay in my ear, especially while running.  "
these have a weird design that doesn't allow the earbud to fit inside the ear to make a good seal.  
i tried all three sizes but the flat rounded part right before the tip prevents the earbud from getting into the ear and making a good seal.  
the sound quality is pretty poor without a good seal.  
"also, it's pretty infuriating that the cord does not look like the picture.  "
"instead of it being a nice looking straight band like shown, its all crumpled and wavy and looks terrible and cheap."
"out of the all the ones i tried (4 from amazon and the 2 from walmart): treblab j1 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b06zxr7646/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01__o00_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1fyi, other ones i tried on amazon:> villain wireless headphones - exact same issue.  "
"bad design, the flat round part that keeps the buds out of your ear canal."
>
phaiser
bhs-530 -
these are a little better.  
the make it part of the way in but still can't make a good seal because of
the design causes them to pivot and pop out of your ear as soon as you move.
"i initially wondered how good these wireless headphones can be considering the price point, but after using them for several weeks, i was amazed by the quality results these headphones deliver and how well they matched the description from the product page."
sound/audio:-
"after using it for several weeks and comparing it with some other wireless headphones, i think the audio and sound is one of the highest quality for bluetooth, wireless earbuds-"
"the bass is really good, and the stereo sound is amazing-"
"i really like the cvc noice cancelling feature,"
"when i'm in a noisy environment such as the train, these headphones do a really good job of blocking out the outside noise and allowing you to focus on the sound from the headphones- you can listen to these headphones from a good amount of distance from your devicedesign:-"
"the headphones fit very well in my ear and stay on very nicely even while i do activities such as working out at the gym, running, biking, etc.-"
they are very comfortable to wear-
i like how you can put them over your neck
so they don't come in the way-
"one feature that i would really love to see in the next version of this product are magnetic clips on the headphones so when they are over your shoulder, they can stick to each other making it easier to stay on your shouldersfunctionality-"
i love how quick and seamlessly the headphones connect to your device.
"since both pair of earbuds are wired to each other, there is no need for them to pair to each other; therefore, as soon as you turn them on, they pair automatically to your device very quick and easily-"
i like how you can control the volume of the sound from the top of the right earbud which is very convenient-
the battery life is amazing on these headphones.
i have been able to use these for the whole day without having to recharge them.
"sometimes when i don't use them heavily, they last several days without charge."
they battery
life for these is about 8 hours as listed on the product page which met my expectations for how long they will last with a single charge.
the charging time was also fairly quick for me to recharge the headphones.-

install flash player i bought these to wear when i go for walks and runs.
i wanted a inexpensive bluetooth ear bud that could get sweaty.
this is working great!!
i usually listen to an interval training app or a podcast.
the sound is great for that.
the noise canceling really works well.
so these would be even better for exercise in the gym.
"i have been leaving one bud out of my ear when outside, so i can still hear people approaching me on the trails."
i was using these while doing house work yesterday and i was able to answer my phone
and it paused my podcast.
"been using these headphones 4days now connected to my samsung phone with no problem and reconnected with my phone as soon i turn it on as long as my phone bluetooth is on ,made"
"well no problems so far ,sound quality is good"
"have used them while i'm working out,working in the yard and while i'm talking on the phone"
the person on the other end says it sounds clear and all controls work fine
", can't beat the price, will update the review if any problems but loving them right now holds charge been using the most of the days for long periods no problems"
i figured i would give a lengthy/in-depth review about these headphones.
"first, let me explain that i am a fairly active person"
and i am also a medical student on top of that
(this will be relevant later).
"i am going to break this down into five sections: connectivity, sound, running"
"/exercising, battery life, and controls."
connectivity:
i have an iphone and the headphones paired instantly.
"at first, i thought it was strange that they pair separately, but now i like it."
"if i want to put the left ear piece in and listen to lecture while jamming out, i can do so or vice versa."
sound:
"i have owned over the ear headphones, beats by dre, standard iphone ear pods, knock offs, etc."
"in my honest opinion, these compete with the best of them."
"they send you three different size earpieces (s,m, and l), and i found the medium is the best fit for myself and gives me the best bass/sound."
running
/exercising: i do insanity workouts (t25) and i also run.
"so, everything is high impact and quick paced."
"saying that, this is where my excitement for these headphones come in!"
"i purchased two different sets of headphones (these headphones) and a pair that are bluetooth, but they sort of hook over your ears."
"i tried them both out, and i eventually picked these over the “hooking” headphones."
"if you pick the correct earpiece (s,m, or l)"
they never fall out.
"battery life: it does have a fairly short battery life (around three hours), but if you carry the battery pack around with you, it can quadruple your battery for the headphones."
i pop these in during class lectures and listen to other material.
during lunch i will charge them and it carries me throughout the rest of the day.
"also, be sure to power them off when not in use."
controls:
"i’m used to basic headphones that do nothing, except allow you to listen to music."
"so, the fact that i can skip songs, and access siri with a touch of a button is nice."
"overall, i know this sounds like an infomercial, but i really enjoy the ease of these headphones."
"after seeing the wireless airpods, i knew it was only time until i wanted a pair."
"so, i researched what would best fit me and these took the"
cake.*if

install flash player i liked these ear buds so much that i have actually purchase a few pairs for family now.  
they seem sturdy;  they stay put in my ears even when i am pretty active.  
"more important to me, the sound quality is really great"
and i am hearing elements in music that i often don't hear or only normally hear with my $200 corded audiophile headset.  
that they can be purchased for under $100
makes them a great value.  
that they are closer to $25
makes them incredible!!

the nose cancellation is wonderfulsound quality is
perfectbattery life is greatsturdy...
great colors
crisp nice sound.
can’t barely hear lawn mower
just do it.
"yep, you'll thank me later."
:)
"honestly, i was hesitant to spend another $20 on headphones as i have gone through 4 different amazon brands with high ratings within the last year under $30."
yah...
you read that right...
the last year.
they simply could not hold up to the intensity i needed them for.
"i use earbuds rigorously everyday with my intense workouts ranging from average 1-3 hours varying from lifting weights, hiit, trail running, plyometrics, liss, yoga and so forth."
"i also use them for outdoor rec activities, yard work, and downtime."
as silly as this sounds... i expect my earbuds to be able to work as hard and keep up with what i do.
"nothing worse than being half way through a workout and your earbuds die, keep falling out, or the notorious headache of discomfort....etc."
etc.
"i want to focus on the task at hand not worrying about my stinking earbuds, right?"
so why did i go through so many earbuds within this price point and not just pony up the money for several hundreds of dollars for a name brand version
", you ask?"
"because i am a frugal, minimalist woman that can't stand the thought of losing a pair of earbuds for that kind of money on some trail run or watching them sink to the bottom of the lake when they get knocked off the kayak."
disclaimer delivered.
:)
so here i was debating on these letscom buds
opposed to $170 brand in my cart.
i sat for weeks debating on what to do.
i decided to give these buds a shot....
"maybe, just maybe these ones may be the diamond in the rough for this price range."
boy!
was i shocked
and i mean shocked when i first put these in!
"they are by far the softest, most luxury feeling earbuds"
i have put in my ear within this price point.
( fyi:
i literally giggled with joy...
my kids looked at me weird with my giddiness.)
they are insanely comfortable.
they melt to your ears like butter and are so light feeling that you hardly feel them there.
"the first week i kept ""checking"" to see if they were still in my ears...even though i could hear the music perfectly."
weird behavior i have never performed before.
lol.  
i have found previous ear buds to be stiff and uncomfortable; no matter adjusting them a bagillion times and dealing with constant slip/falling out during workouts.
these have stayed put and been so easy on the ear.
"i find that when i take them out my ears aren't sore, tired, or i have acquired a throbbing headache with the weight of them."
"some of you, hopefully, must know what i meant about that."
"i have ears on the smaller side since i am a petite, fiery side."
sound quality is excellent and surpasses any earbud i have tried in this price point!
after purchasing these you definitely need to listen to music in 8k!  
"sound is pure, with the right amount of treble, clarity and tones...."
perfect amount of bass.
i am a person that good bass is important...pushes you through grueling workouts....
but not so much bass that your brain is banging
and you can't even hear the singer's voice (flashback to the suitcase sized sub-woofer in the trunk-of- your-car-days of high school.
not good my friends.
lol.
:) )
other quality points that must be noted is they are modern and sleek looking.
"i thoroughly enjoy the controls being in your ear piece opposed to having a separate ""box"" further down the line that bangs into your head or neck."
that is flat out obnoxious...
i made that mistake only once.  
easily pairs with any blue tooth device
and i like having a hard shell case to throw in my gym bag or hiking backpack.
i have been using these everyday for the past month and so far i will definitely purchase these again....
sheerly based on the unmatched comfort and sound quality...
they by far surpass everything i have paid for so far.
even proving to be better quality than my $80 earbuds.
i admittedly am quite upset
i didn't purchase these sooner.
another proof in the pudding is when when your two teenagers steal your earbuds....
"yep, i hide these bad boys...."
over their $200 headphones that says a lot.
i am excited to see how far these take me.
:)
best $20
i have spent in a long time!

install flash player i love these headphones.
such a great price.
they come with 3 different ear pieces which work for all ears.
they stay fully charged through many lifts for me.
they have great color options.
the best part they drown out all the excess noise and they don’t get ruined due to sweat buildup in the ears.
i highly encourage you to get these headphones for the gym or running or hiking or anything.
great quality.
"i have a difficult time finding earbuds that fit in my tiny ear canals, and these were recommended by people who specifically have my problem finding a comfortable fit."
"i got them today, charged them, and tried them out."
they came with four sets of traditional covers and 1 set of covers that are like foam earplugs.
i traded out the traditional covers for the earplug version.
"they are incredibly comfortable, and do a great job of blocking external noise."
"after wearing them for well over an hour my ears weren’t sore at all, and they stayed put thanks to the earplug covers and the adjustable ear loops."
"sound quality was better than expected—i don’t expect earbuds under $30 to sound like over-$100 models—but these are quite good, with adequate bass presence."
"pairing was fairly easy, and while i’m still learning the controls"
i’m
sure i’ll be happy with how things work once i get used to them.
for the price i’m very happy with this purchase
"when i bought these headphones, my expectations were low."
how good could $20 wireless headphones be?
"on the flip side, i figured they were only $20, so i didn't have much to lose."
"as it turns out, they're really good"
"(at least, based on a couple days' use): the sound quality is great, charging time is quick"
", microphone quality is fantastic (much to my surprise!), and they're so lightweight"
", i barely know they're in my ears."
"make no mistake, these are no-frills headphones."
"they come with a case, instructions, and a very short micro-usb cable for charging."
"there's no app, no integration with fitness trackers, etc., but i didn't need those things because it turns out i already own a smartphone that has the, you know, smarts."
caveat:
i have not yet tried them while exercising or in the rain.
"otherwise, this was the best $20 i've spent in a while!"
i’ve struggled to find the perfect gym headphones
and i think i’ve finally found them!
"firstly i love the colors, plus the case they come in!"
these stay put on my ears during a rigorous cardio workout.
these are always in my gym bag now.
i also like that i don’t hear people talking or
the gyms overhead music when i have these on.
"the quality of the sound isn’t distorted, it’s clear and crisp!"
i have been using my over the ear kinivo bth240 for 6 years (purchased few of them for my own fault).  
"when the on/off button finally failed, i decided to give a try to newer headphones."
"i tested side by side letscom, mpow flame, phaise"
"bhs-530, and edelin."
to jump to the end - i didn't like either one of them.
"first, let me start to say that letscom and mpow flame are exactly the same headphones branded differently."
"common practice today to buy the same no-name hardware from china, put you brand over, and then try to have better marketing then others."
nothing wrong with that.
"so basically, both are identical, offer the same fit, function."
"comfortable to wear (not for long for me), you can run with them, quality of sound is ok."
"very basic sound, although not distorted, which is a plus, unlike the edelin."
"the main reason i returned letscom is because they are not good for long or short running because they seal you ear quite a bit and you don't hear much sound around you, which i found to be not good when you run and share trail with other people/bikes."
you want to hear them approaching from the back.
"also, i found in general, to have your ears plugged for over an hour"
(my typical run) is much more tiresome on ears when compared to over the ear headphones.  
"in the end, i tried levin over the ear headphones, and they were exactly what i was looking for my runs."
"other than comfort, another key difference between over the ear and in-ear is that all in-ear headphones have only 2 control buttons for sound."
"same button to increase the volume and skip the song, and another to decrease the volume, and go back another song."
it all depends how you press them.
"when you run, especially wearing gloves, it is not comfortable to play with these two small buttons simply to change the song."
"over the ear headphones, offer 4 buttons (volume up, down, next song, previous song)."
much easier to press with gloves.
i got these based on the reviews.
i was looking at the powerbeats and heard from many people how they always end up breaking...
and a lot of the reviews for these were prior powerbeats owners who said they were amazingly comparable.
i also had over the ear beats for years but they ended up biting the dust and this sound is crazy comparable.
i give it two thumbs up and will be buying a few more pairs for my hubby and kids.
these are excellent headphones!
the sound is clear with both music/videos and phone calls.
"the caller can be heard very clearly, as well as, the caller can hear me with no background noise (other people or car and road sounds).  "
i purchased a different set a couple weeks ago and had many complaints that the caller could not hear me or i sounded
"like i was in a tunnel, not the case with these."
i am impressed with the quality!!
"sure, they're inexpensive.  "
i'm not looking for symphony hall quality; i'm looking for casual listening.  
"actually, i was surprised at how well these sound.  "
i use them infrequently for casual at home listening.  
have not used them at the gym yet and doubt i will; i don't want my device in my pocket when i'm in the fitness center.  
i do use wired earbuds in the fitness center for machines that have a screen.  
the buds occasionally fall from my ear
which i
why i believed i wanted this style because of the hook over my ear.  
"by coincidence, the last time i saw my son, he had a similar pair.  "
i believe you'll find these with several brand name stamps; likely a foreign company makes them all.  
"yes, i would make this purchase again.  "
"for the price, i think they're a bargain."
i bought 2 other pairs of earbuds before i gave up and bought these thinking that they would just do part of what i wanted
but they doe everything!i wanted a pair of bluetooth earbuds that allowed me to pair 2 devices at the same time and switch between them as seamlessly as possibly with little to no lag.
i bought a pair of sound peets and they were really really bad.
then i tried a pair of to zo for $50 thinking that they'd be better since they cost more.
they were wireless earbuds and were really bad as well.
i felt like what i was looking for was only found in earbuds that were $100
+
and i decided that i'd just get a cheap pair of earbuds to handle working out.
i bought these thinking that they would do fine but amazingly they do everything i wanted them to do and more.
they are awesome for pairing with 2 devices and switching between the two
is much more seamless than the previous two.
i've experienced a small amount of lag but tolerable compared to the last 2 pairs of earbuds.
the only thing that i'd change about these is that i'd ask the manufacturer to include an actual clip that can be attached to the wire and clipped to a shirt.
i often only have one earpiece in my ear at work and would love to clip the wire to my shirt so that the hanging earpiece doesn't pull on the earpiece i have in my ear.
"honestly, it doesn't pull that much unless it slides"
and i turn my head a lot.
"also, it would be amazing if i could turn the left earpiece off and in so doing that turns the sound into mono coming out of the right earbud only."
definitely worth the price!
"as soon as i put on the earphone, i could feel it was very secure.  "
the medium-sized earplug that came as default was a good fit for me.  
it was very comfortable to wear and felt secure even with lots of head movement.
the controls were easy to access.
the buttons were responsive and well placed.  
connecting to the phone was a cinch.  
so far so good.
the sound.  
this is where it falls short.  
"as soon as i heard the ""power on"" message from the earphone, i could tell this unit was going to be very bass heavy.  "
i do like lots of basses.  
but the sound seemed muffled due to heavy throughout the entire range.  
the highs don't sound crisp because of it.  
i'm not sure if it's because the earphone hasn't been broken into yet.  
these things take hours of playing time to get it broken into.  
so i will update the review after i've used it for a while.
"so to sum it up, this is a very well designed comfortable easy to use earphone.  "
the initial reaction is that the sound quality leaves something to be desired for.  
"but since this is an all around good unit, i'd like to give it a try and see if the sound quality improves over time."

as someone who routinely loses headphones and sunglasses... it's hard to buy another $100+ item knowing that i'll be lucky to have it until next month.  
"sadly, last week i found myself needing another set of headphones that:1.  "
sounded good2.  
stayed in place comfortably when i worked out3.  
had a microphone that works4.  
wouldn't cause me to go nuts when i inevitably lose
'emthese checked off all the boxes.  
are they bose noise canceling quality?  
nope.  
but so far i've listed to hours of music ranging from jóhann jóhannsson to tool and
all of it sounded really good.
these come with choices of several sizes of earbuds.  
"i used the ones installed and they are comfortable, even on this morning's pre-dawn run."
"i haven't talked on the phone using these outdoors yet, but usually in those cases i don't mind holding the phone to head"
like it's 1982 all over again.  
however in my office i've answered (and made)
several calls.  
everyone i've asked said the sound quality is perfect on the other side.
they're only $20.  
"huge bargain!furthermore, they are easy to pair and come with a nice storage / carrying case.  "
i'll be buying another pair.  
probably immediately just to stay ahead of the curve.
"for the price of bluetooth headphones, these really can't be beat."
"they come in a round case about 4 inches in diameter which stores the headphones, charging cable, ear pieces, and clip for the wire."
there are three different sized earpieces so you can choose which is more comfortable.
i have small ears
so the over ear clip fits pretty loosely
but they haven't fallen out yet.
"once you get them in the right position, they are comfortable."
i like the connecting cable
so i can hang them around my neck when they're not being used.
i use them for listening to podcasts via my apple watch and videos on my ipad.
"i was able to connect them to the watch, iphone, and ipad."
the range seems to be pretty good.
i left my phone in my living room and walked upstairs and it held the signal until i went into another bedroom.
"there is audio feedback as far as the status such as ""headphones connected"" to let you know what is going on."
i've enjoyed having these available at work and to have a pair of headphones for my apple watch.
"i've owned several of these, and i treat them pretty rough,."
i use them mostly when mowing grass on a farm.
what i have found is that i need to carry my phone in my right hand pocket
(i normally carry it in my left) because the bluetooth will cut in an out with normal movements involved in driving a tractor or lawn mower.
i assume its because the circuitry for coupling is in the right earbud housing.
another alternative is to wear my phone in an armband on right arm.
"i've seen the same problem  in other brands, so i wouldn't blame letscom for being any better or worse in this style and price point."
"the sound quality is good, but a little weak for using when working with noisy equipment; probably for the best sense i need to be able to hear if something goes wrong around me."
"i find that i have to adjust the snugness of the earbud often, but that is also common across the earbuds i have owned."
"when i use these just for walking, i think they are quite adequate, and have a nice range of frequency and good volume level."
they tuck under my collar when not in use
so i don't lose them.
"all in all, i recommend these , and have bought them as gifts for others."
they cam in a nice xmas-themed gift box this xmas; a nice touch.
for $20 these headphones are perfect.
i use them 3-4 times a week to workout
and i do not have to recharge until the end of the week.
i find that they charge relatively fast as well.
the sound quality is good for the price.
the only issue i have is with songs that have a lot of bass.
"since i didn’t buy these headphones for the bass, i’ll live with it."
i have headphones with and without the extra bands that go around the ear
and i have to say i enjoy these a little better for working out.
it gives that extra security even though they stay pretty well put anyway.
the first few seconds of the first song i played with these headphones made it apparent
these are cheap and the audio quality is poor.  
sounds as if the bass is blaring on these suckers and that is conflicting with the audio
qualityupdate:  
letcom contacted me numerous times.  
"the first time, i said i would happily accept a proposed refund and if they were willing, would test out another pair of headphones"
(they claimed they would).  
"received the refund and that makes me happy, but did not update my rating.  "
they contacted me 6 more times in total and
so here is my update.
man...
you can't beat this price.
the quality of these headphones are top tier with a sleek design similar to all those other big name brands.
"i bought these simply for any type of fitness related activity, that being resistance training and cardio."
"so far, no issues or any form of discomfort with my ears during my 1-2 hour sessions."
my only minor complaint is that the wire is a bit long.
"if they had some sort of clip to close the gap of the wire, it would be an awesome addition."
the headphones come with it's own case with a short usb charger and extra ear buds to replace (major plus).
the range of the bluetooth goes pretty far which i'd probably estimate anywhere between 25-35 yards maybe even 40.
enough to cover a standard turf setup at a commercial gym as i do not personally like to have my phone on me.
"as for sound quality, the bass is pretty deep and rich as long as my phone volume is maxed out."
"at times, i feel that the left side of the earphone kinda lacks with the base, but with a minor adjustment the sound quality improves."
i probably started noticing this after 15+ sessions.
"the battery life of the earphones last a good while, i did not have to charge mine after roughly  6-8 training sessions."
"overall, a great set of wireless headphones for the price."
i definitely recommend.

update review 2/20/2019**i posted this review and the company reached out to me shortly after to apologize for the experience that we had with this item.  
they were quick to want to make it right by sending out another pair at no cost to us.  
i wanted to wait a while before revising this review as it hasn't been that long since my husband started using them again.  
so far it has been about 3 weeks and he has not had any issues thus far with the headphones.
i am changing my review from 2 stars to 5 stars.  
it really says a lot when a company will go out of their way to make good on a situation when it comes to the quality of their products.
the fact they responded to my review at all surprised me as most companies don't in my experience.  
my daughter and i both need new bluetooth headphones and i will definitely buy the same pair again!**original review**bought these as a gift for my husband and he loved them!!
while working out at the gym this morning the entire side of the headphones came off!
i know these are not super expensive headphones but still.
he was very disappointed as he can no longer use them.
my work allows me to listen to music as long as i only have 1 earbud in.
"i used to use wired earbuds, but they kept getting damaged where the cable was going into my pocket."
"after going through my 4th pair of wired earbuds, i started looking into bluetooth earbuds."
"i didn't need a pair that had amazing sound quality, as i only really listen to podcasts and audio books"
", i just wanted them to have the ability to pause, change the volume, and to skip forward/backward."
these earbuds had all of those features.
"the hook that goes over your ear fits very well, at least for me, and i have never worried about them falling out during use."
"another use of the hook that i find very useful is the ability to hook it on a collar or around a jacket button, which allows me to have easy access to the side that has the audio controls."
"for the cost of the earbuds, i think that these are a very good value."
"i wasn't expecting much with the sound quality, but i definitely don't feel like i would have a bad time listening to music."
"obviously they're not going to compare to a good pair of headphones, but they are great for their price range."
pros:•
"the hook allows for easy access to controls when only using 1 earbud, solidly hooks around a collar of button.• has the ability to change volume or pause, button is easy to press"
but i don't find myself accidentally pressing
it.•
you can skip forward/backward with a long press on the volume button.
"this is a great feature for me, especially when listening to podcasts/audio"
books.• great price for what you're
getting.• looks
nice• connects very quickly to my phone.
"fastest connection i've ever seen in a bluetooth device, the ""connected"" message often interrupts the ""power on"" message.• good battery life, lasts me for a complete work day, which is about 8 1/2 hours."
"cons:• good sound quality for the price, but wouldn't be up to an audiophile's"
"standards.• a bit on the bulky side, but not overly so."
i don't have any problem with them
but i don't think they can be considered sleek.
"overall, a great value."
i really don't have much to complain about these earbuds.
"i haven't tried them in a wet environment, and i likely, never will, so"
i can't comment on their water resistance.
i would recommend them to anyone who needs a cheap pair of bluetooth earbuds.
i am the kind of girl that likes to bump my music loud and not be bothered in the gym.
these headphones help me do just that.
it blocks out sound so well and the sound quality is seriously impeccable.
not to mention to the battery life on these babies is amazing.
a full battery lasts me about about 4-5 days!

"after owning two rather expensive bluetooth earbud/headphones (one audio-technica, one sony, buth reputable manufacturers), both of which left me wanting for more, i bought this unit."
"after receiving it, charging it, and testing it out on a wide array of modern and classical music, as well as audio content on videos and dvr content, i came to the following consclusionpluses"
* general sound quality (but read on!)
*
"apparent construction, lots of rubber and attempts to seal and protect the innards from water intrusion"
* comfort of the over-ear/in-ear arrangement
*
a set of replacement silicone
"in-ear contact pointsminuses*  initial battery life after getting a 'fully charged' solid blue led indicator - approximately 6-7 hours, not impressive at all"
"* a horribly annoying warning message that as the song 'i've got you under my skin' notes, 'repeats and repeats in my ear, every effing minute, effectively preventing you from using the device after the battery life hits the warning level.  "
another reviewer has noted that this point is the 30%  remaining battery capacity.  
"so whatever the battery capacity actually is, you can only use 70% of it before the annoying robotic female warning notice kills whatever mood you've created through watching your content or listening to your music.  "
"thanks, designer.  "
"thanks, programmer."
*  
"an amplification setting that results in very loud, although mostly clear, volume level for the device.  "
"i adjusted the device's volume all the way down, intending to control the volume level at the ear with the volume controls on my ipad air 2.  "
"i had to drive that volume level down to a 2-bar (i..e., almost off) to be able to listen comfortably to content at a normal level.  "
very unusual default amplification setting.  
"silly, actually."
the deal killer
*
"as i said, one of my musical tests is classical music programming, contained in my widely-varied itunes music library.  "
"listening to j.s. bach organ music is good test for any music reproduction devices - from amplification electronics through speakers, turntables/cartridges (remember those?  "
i still do) and headphones.
"deep, sustained bass tones, some of them below the level of human hearing, come out of organ pipes, so organ music is, in my opinion, an acid test for most speakers and headphones.  "
"most of these devices, particularly headphones and earbuds, cannot be expected to reproduce these low tones, so most manufacturers filter (i.e., ""roll off"")"
"signals below a certain level, usually between 20hz and 50hz, so as to not burden reproduction  components such as speakers and headphones,"
"this device, whether it attempts to filter out these low tones or not, simply cannot handle low bass.  "
i can only describe the sound of low bass as unlistenable.  
it sounds like someone successfully and continuously ripping a sheet of aluminum foil.  
so ended my organ concert.  
i'm sure it would fail on any other musical types as well.  
anything that would provide sustained (for any length of time) would cause the device to perform in the same unacceptable way.  
be forewarned.  
"of course, it could only be this specific device that's bad.  "
"no matter, it's going back."
"i understand and acknowledge that i am writing a review of $20 earphones, and admittedly, my standards are high.  "
"but, hey, this is what i listen to, and with a short and simple test, i revealed enough flaws in this device to decide to send it back."
it simply didn't make the grade.
like the product but now after 6 weeks spontaneously in the middle of a song skips back to an earlier song.
guess
ill see how good the warranty is.
letscom read my review and contacted me before i could contact them and rushed me another headphone set without me having to send the defective one back.
the new one does not skip.
i find the headphones comfortable
and i like the controls on the ear piece better than the beets.
"battery lasts 8-10 hours, but only 10-15 minutes warning before it runs down."
"if i charge it weekly, i have no problem using it 10 hrs/wk."
sound is good.
very impressed with letscom’s customer service.
not a better deal for $20.
i feel stupid for buying expensive earbuds.
"i've had jaybirds, skullcandys, beats, and they've all broken and don't even have great customer service."
"these guys left a note in the case saying ""return these?"
"ignore amazon and call this number""."
they're really confident about their product and rightfully so.
"sound is good, battery life is good, and usability is pretty clever."
only three buttons
but they do quite a bit and its actually logical.
"they stay on the ear good, the box they came in was nice.."
i have no real complaints.
highly recommend these to anyone using them for everyday and gym use.
i bought these headphones as a replacement for my iphone headphones bc
i wanted wireless.
i wasn’t expecting much from them
but i was pleasantly surprised.
they are great for the gym they don’t fall out of my ears they are comfortable and durable.
the only problem i had with them is the bass is sub par.
it is pretty fuzzy gets quite annoying to listen to
so i just avoid songs with bass.
also the range the reach isn’t very far
but i don’t find that to be much of a problem since im never too far from my phone.
the battery life is top notch though!
lasts for 2 days
but i charge my quite frequently
so it could last for longer
and i don’t know.
all in all good pair of headphone not a long term deal for me though.
pros:
the headphones arrived nearly completely charged right out of the box.  
i was able to pair them to my android phone and windows pc.  
pairing was easy for both.  
initially i was disappointed with audio quality coming from the pc.  
"the music sounded like it was coming from a tin can at the bottom of a pool (really bad), but podcasts from the computer and conversations over the phone were fine.  "
after double checking i realized i was listening to music with the hands free profile
but i should have been using the stereo profile.  
once i switched to stereo profile the music from the pc was great.  
battery life seems great as well.  
once i charge them (which doesn't take long)
they tend to run all day even though i am using them for music as well as for phone conversations.
cons:
charging the headphones disconnects them from devices so reconnecting after charging is necessary (takes seconds but has to be done).it was too easy to redial the previous call and not cancel /
hang up before the other person answered.
verdict:
i would buy these again.
"got these because i work in a high-heat, high-noise warehouse doing intense manual labor."
"therefore, i sweat like a beast, and i went through three ipod shuffles due to sweat running down the headphone cord and into the jack, shorting out the unit."
"for the longest time after, i just didn't bother."
"i looked at these kinds of headphones over the years, but none of them seemed to be intended for the type of enviroment i was going to use them in."
"decided to give these a chance,"
glad i did.
believe i paid $20 for them at purchase.
they've been great; i use them nearly every night at work.
"they're quite comfortable although after about 4 hours they tend to make my ear canals a teensy bit sore, but it's nothing deal-breaking."
"sound is quite good, and loudness is limited only by your phone, really, as the volume ties directly into your phone's volume output through bluetooth (they don't have an independent setting)."
"you can take and make calls while on them, and the mic and speaker are better than the ones on my phone"
(i have a motorola e5
"plus, great phone"
unless you wanna make a phone call and talk to someone).sweat is not an issue at all.
these are coated with a resistant plastic that also doesn't slip around in your fingers when wet.
"everything is either sealed and enclosed, or covered with said plastic."
even the charging port has a stopper made out of rubber attached to the headphones.
"overall, they are fantastic and i'll probably be getting a 2nd pair while they are still available."
summary:-
bluetooth works well-
great battery
life- very comfortable-
sound quality is good enough
"(details below)i was looking at wireless earbuds in the $100-200 range, but at $20, i thought i'd give these a shot."
i love them--
"the battery seems to last forever, they stay in my ears well, and they're very comfortable."
the clip is nice because i don't feel like they're going to fall out even when i'm running.
"additionally, i didn't have any issues with the bluetooth, and the range is pretty good."
"if you're looking for inexpensive wireless earbuds, these deliver and then some."
my biggest concern when i ordered these was the sound quality.
"to test it, i compared them side-by-side with sennheiser hd600 headphones (the gold standard for studio headphones) and wired google pixel earbuds."
"the studio equipment obviously blows these out of the water, but it provides a good reference point."
"as with many consumer audio products, these earbuds sound terrible at high volumes."
the treble becomes harsh and tinny and the bass is very thin.
"that said, i never use them at a high enough volume for it to matter."
"at lower volumes, the treble is pretty good, while the bass is still lacking in depth, which is pretty much what i expected."
"at low or moderate listening levels, the letscom earbuds were comparable the pixel earbuds."
"the pixel buds have too much bass, which makes the higher frequencies sound muffled."
"by contrast, the letscom earbuds have clearer highs and mids, but thin bass."
"with eq, they sound about the same."
"the wireless version of the pixel buds costs $160, and assuming they sound about the same as the wired ones, i don't think it's worth the extra money."
"i'll probably replace these in a few years when there are better, cheaper hi-fi options available."
"until then, these do the job nearly as well as products that cost $100 more."
i lost my beats on vacation.
i had only had them for 2 months and really didn’t want to spend the $120 to replace them.
i ordered these thinking they would be a temporary solution.
how good could $20 earphones be?
they are great!
i’m never going back.
i don’t listen to music that much
"and when i do i’m not picky about sound,"
so i can’t comment on that.
i listen to books and podcasts and the sound is the same as the beats.
the battery life is way better.  
connection to my iphone is automatic.
i had to go to bluetooth and reconnect the beats every time.
and i don’t live in fear of losing them.
win.
win.
win.
i love these headphones.
i've had them for a few weeks now
and i use them all the time.
the sound quality is great!
lots of bass which i love.
they are in fact waterproof.
"the first day i got them, i was anxious to test them"
so i used them in the shower and they still sounded great.
i am also a runner and go running when its sprinkling out and they don't cause any problems for me.
they hold very well for running.
i haven't had any problems with them falling out.
the adjustable ear plugs are really great because i have smaller ears and
"the medium and large sizes were super uncomfortable, but the small buds fit perfectly!"
the best part of this product is the battery life.
this battery lasts forever!
i could use it for a few days before i need to charge it.
"anyways, i highly recommend this product."
especially for runners.
would definitely buy again.
good quality workout headphones.
doesn’t come off when jogging.
good sound quality.
good price.
great colors selection.
i bought these for running and absolutely love them.
they stayed in place comfortably even through the sweat.  
the sound is very crisp with a nice deep bass.
i had to buy a second pair for my husband because he liked them so much and kept borrowing mine.  
the case it comes with is very nice and compact as well.
great headphines.
but the bewt part is that they come with a freee csrrying case and different tips for your ears.
these ear buds have great range.
i can walk all over the small office building at work and still get signal.
i had no trouble connecting them to my phone.
they are comfortable and high quality in both make and sound.
the only thing i wish these things have is adjustable hooks for behind the ear.
"i guess i have tiny ears, but the hooks intended to help these things stay in (i like to just hang them on my ear"
so i can still hear coworkers)
are too long for me.
"when used normally, they stay snuggly in the ear so that i don't even need the extra help of these hooks, even when exercising."
"these bluetooth earbuds are perfect for music, the sound quality is great and they stay in place."
that is saying something as i have tried quite a few different brands as a truck driver to be able to hear over the background noise and have them stay in ear
eithe the vibration and excess movement!
i purchased these because i travel a lot and was tired of the speaker cord get tangled up.  
i took these on a business trip this week and the battery life and sound quality was excellent.  
my flight was delayed and used them for over 12 hrs with battery to spare.  
on conference call the quality is great and no one has an issue with hearing me.  
great headphones at a great price!
"took me a minute to get the fit right in my ears, but once i did, the noise cancelling effect was obvious even before i put any music on."
good cheap bluetooth headphones.
they work great for driving and for listening to podcasts or music for a couple hours in the morning.
i like the accsblility of pushing the button on them to pause or answer the phone.
the ear piece stays on really good and fits in my ear comfortably.  
it's a good length for keeping around your neck all day and tucking them inside your shirt to hide them.
i like them for easy answering a call quick at work and still continue to work.
the ear pieces stay on.
my last pair i kept loosing little black piece that goes inside your ear.
i keep them wrapped around my bra strap to keep them in place.
disclaimer:
i was reimbursed for the cost of this product in exchange for an honest review.
these headphones are better than i had even hoped considering the cost of the product.
they have a very good range.
i've walked 30ft away from my phone and had no issues with losing the signal.
"additionally, i was surprised that they came with a nice hard shell case."
"they stay in my ears while running/working out, and i've yet to drain the battery of the headphones even after using them for about 6 hours over the course of three days."
"not sure how long the battery is supposed to last, but that seems pretty good to me considering the price point."
it's also nice that i can pause music or video with the button on the side of the headphones.
"very pleased so far, and i would definitely recommend them to friends."
update:
"i left my phone in the house and walked outside, 30-40 feet away and was still listening to my music on these headphones."
i've also run in the rain with them on and had no issues.
i keep liking them more and more.
initially i posted an admittedly over critical review of these earphones.
"after spending a little more time using them, it is my opinion that they are actually pretty good, considering the price paid."
"sound is decent, battery life is really good and bluetooth calling is very good."
"they fit well to, even with glasses on."
"my only gripe is you can see a reflection of the bluetooth light blinking, when you wear your glasses."
had two of these and both died after an intense workout where there was moderate sweat.  
had another pair of headphones called mpow that are nearly identical to these
and they did the same thing.  
"price is great, so kept ordering, but not worth the hassle and the added up expense.  "
switching products.
sound quality is awful.
extremely distorted and crackly.
don’t waste your money!
i’ve been looking for a wireless earbuds for a long time.
and these fits the bill.
shipping is quick and package arrived in perfect conditions.
very comfortable to wear.
"so far the battery is pretty good, and they charge quite fast."
operating and pairing it up with my iphone and macbook is a breeze.
so far i really like it.
"after putting it on, it seems there’s a bit of passive noise canceling."
fits snugly in ear and won’t easily fall off.
these headphones are unusable for me.
they are way too big
"and i cannot get a soundproof auction that stays on while just walking around, despite trying all the different attachments."
the sound quality is also poor (fuzzy) and the microphone doesn’t work.
"i wish i could turn the volume just one notch lower than the lowest in quiet places, but it just mutes it."
"i feel like i’m getting hearing damage with these loud, not canceling headphones."
they are bulky to carry in a pocket or purse
and i wish they had a magnet to hang together around my neck.
"design-wise the round side button looks cool, but when i wear a winter hat or scarf with them, it often accidentally gets hit, turning them off."
"i have tried to make these work for me, but they simply don’t."
these headphones are the most worthless kind i have ever tried and i have switched to a different brand.
i cannot believe these are so highly rated on amazon!

"works good, fits pretty well."
used it while working out.
used it for about 7-8 hours total before another charge was needed
my friend’s birthday is tomorrow and i bought this for her.
i opened it to try and will repack it later.
i will say the quality fit to the price
"and it gives you three sizes of ear plugs, so you can pick either comfort to you."
"i can’t tell the comparison to other brand since this is the first bluetooth that i had, but i will say it’s value for the price, and it looks great!"
i don't usually comment on products but this product is something else!
everyone in my family had tried it and want a pair of their own.
with that said there was a lot of pros and minor cons to the product.
let's start with the price and the shipping:the price was more than decent compared to other bluetooth product!
i am in college so this was an affordable option compared to air pods.
"the shipping was 1 day (there was a free 1 day shipping deal), and it came on time with no problems."
"the package and design:the package was pretty simple and organized, nothing was damaged."
"the only thing they didn't have is a plug to put the charging wire in, also the length of the wire is small but a samsung charger works on it"
just fine!the actual design of the product is pretty useful!
"my mom tried the ear buds on, she said these are the first ear buds that don't fall out of her ear."
i go the gym often
and i also noticed they stick in place like they should.
connection with phone:
it connected to my phone with no problem!
"i also set the ear buds up, so whenever i have them on, i can unlock my phone automatically."
the ear buds answer phone calls like it should
"but the only problem i have is changing music, skipping a song"
", i use spotify so that feature did not work for me."
"i also like the fact that i can use one ear bud for one device and connect the other one to another device, it helps when listening to video lecture and music at the same time."
productivity:
"the earbuds helps when trying to do multiple things at once, cleaning the dishes and vacuuming without having my phone on me the whole time with wired earphones."
"i can walk around a good distance without having my phone on me, especially when taking a call without having to walk over to my phone."
"sound quality:the music is very clear and blocks surrounding noises completely, even when working out."
note:
"the battery life of the case lasted 4 days for me personally, but i think that depends on usage and how much you initially charge it."
"i am planning to get a couple for my siblings and parents in near future, it makes a perfect present."
these bluetooth headphones work as advertised.
they were easy to pair with my pixel phone and to my computer.
"the sound quality is adequate, especially if you listen to spoken audio like audio books and podcasts.  "
the batteries last for 8 - 10 hours.
i can get about 30 feet of rangeif
i walk away from my phone.
so i have one of those old iphones...
you know the one with the headphone jack
so i never used wireless headphones.  
my wife really likes wireless headphones
so i finally got a pair for the gym and yard work.  
i am blown away
they charged only 20 for these.
"they seem to be high quality, do a great job on noise cancellation."
the gym trip and yard work this week
we’re great as i jammed out to music
the first set worked great but then never charged again after that.
i contacted customer support and they were absolutely wonderful and sent us new set that work wonderfully.
my husband uses them every day for many hours while working and said they are the best headphones he's ever had.
would recommend!
these were the cheaper of 2 sets that i bought but they are better than the more expensive ones.  
i lose airpods
so i need the tether option an so far so good.  
they drown out road noise even in a 91 geo metro if you can believe that.  
"but since i wouldn't lie to you, you can bet that this purchase is not a waste o yo doe."
i've begun to think people really don't know what they're talking about and one must buy a product and see for themselves.
"these buds are fine, but any reference to ""wow!"
"great bass!"", or ""as good as my bose or beats!"" are really just ridiculous.  "
i have a set and for the price- can't beat 'em.  
but the bass is not remarkable.  
i've played beck's wow and a few chainsmokers songs which have a terrifically hard hitting bass portion and these hardly rattle my brains.  
the bluetooth range is very good-
i've walked far away from my sandisk mp3 player and maintained a good connection.  
"these can't be beat for the price, but they are not ""as good as my $100..."""
"had these things for an hour now, took 10 minutes to charge, they connected immediately to my iphone7 (just followed the directions), sound is great (for $20 they exceeded my expectations)"
"no static, well balanced sound."
"they fit perfect, i have zero worry about them falling out of my ears while i run."
will update if there are any problems.
"update, for those worried about blocking out too much sound, making it unsafe to run in traffic, etc...."
i just turned the volume down and had no problems.
this is my first set of earbuds
i've been using earphones..
i canot tell you how satisfied i am.. for a novice this was not all crazy trying to figure it out and it paired with np!  
it has so many functions
i cannot believe it ..
these earbuds do everything but drive lol
the directions are very clear and it does what it says.
love the earbuds!
so far these work great.
paired with amazon fire right away.
so far i cannot get them to pair to my phone
but that might be a phone problem.
i usually use these to listen to audible books and they are great for that.
don’t listen to music much.
"use in the pool to,listen."

i decided to give these a try as i have tried other bt headsets that have wires and they never would last hanging around my neck.  
my work environment is tough on earplugs.
these earbuds are perfect.  
they stay in and have no wires that get pulled as i am crawling around ships.  
the sound is fine and calls are loud and clear.  
i use them one at a time and getting about 4 hours per earbud
that last me all day.  
will see how durable they are in the weeks to come.
*
"*update, emailed me and told me they would refund my purchase to my amazon account... has never happened, going to escalate with amazon!  "
don't buy this pos!  
they pay for good reviews**so
"i got their cheap pos heart rate monitor (don't buy), then got an offer with it that they would send me a free product if i would write a positive review about both of them, or contact them before posting a negative review..."
fishy fishy...
"so chose these bluetooth, waterproof earbuds, whatever u want to call them."
"the hr monitor was terrible, one second"
"my hr was 45 bpm,"
"20 seconds later it was 172 bpm, totally unreliable, terrible to link, only step tracker worked, used for 5 days and it died..."
"fail, hadn't even gotten these headphones yet."
"get the waterproof earbuds a week or so later... used at the gym for 6 days before they broke, i sweat on the treadmill, one earbud started going crackly and then cut out, the other did the same thing shortly after... can only think it was the sweat that caused this as there was no damage or anything, had been working fine for 30 minutes prior and"
"bam - enjoy your next 30 minutes running w/o music playa!terrible company, fake reviews abound on there pages, look at how they sell the same exact product as all these other cheap chinese companies, just slap a different logo or name on it..."
"when the bad reviews start comin in and amazon catches on, new name, new account, rip-off starts again!"
very lightweighted bluetooth earbuds just comfortably fits in my ears.
easy to connects with my smartphone.
"most of all, i love the sound quality."
it came in with extra ear pieces and charger
and i took a photo right away to share this good product.
i am so amazed & ecstatic!!!!
i have the bluetooth that is perfect 4 me!
sound quality is more than i expected
", the noise cancellation"
is
perfect & i love that
my partner can't
get my attention & he can't
hear my music or calls!!!
i have used bluetooths of all varieties since they were available & this is my best choice so far 4 my needs!
"having been a telephone operator for many yrs using headsets, it was the only way i would use my phone ect..."
thanks for making me excited & my partner is learning to not bother talking when i'm wearing  this wonderful bluetooth!!!

this is a handy wireless earbuds with an excellent sound quality and longlasting battery.
the wirless case has a classy look and  small enough to carry everywhere.
"in top of that it auto connects to your phone bluetooth once you take out from the box, easy as that."
i just love this product.
"i got these headphones after my plantronic backbeats fit bit the dust after about 6 years, one of the buttons stopped working."
i have worn beats and bose head phones also.
"the sound in comparison to those headphones is just ok, you can tell it is a cheaper quality."
"the bass is not as deep and the highs are not as crisp, but it sounds good enough for me to get in a solid workout or run."
the fitment is just ok.
they do not fall off my head but they do not stay super tight to my ear either
", i think that is part of the reason the sound is not as good."
i haven't had them long enough to judge the battery life
but it seems to be fine.
pairing and the headphones are easy to operate.
i do really like how the ear pieces come off so it is easier to clean after use.
they are good for the money and if you don't need superior sound or fitment i would recommend them.
"had no issues with seller, got on time with no problem."
"i'll use these until they break, then i'll probably go back to something with a little better quality."
"i initially used these earbuds as a media listening experience to hear my amazon music privately, while on the go."
the phone quality is good on both points - music and phone.
it charges easily and seems to hold a charge for some time.
i purchased these as an alternative to the smaller earbuds to have something easily controllable.
i liked the price as well.
"overall, i would purchase these again."
something i hardly do with amazon.

something i hardly do with amazon.
i have had the product for a couple of weeks now and it is working as expected.
i was looking at other similar brands and this fit the bill.
i wanted something with a longer battery life and this was able to last 3 work out sessions a week at around 2 1/2-3 hours each before being charged.
which is inline with the usage advertised.
no issues with sweat either.  
i also wanted to be able to turn my headphones louder  
then my old pair
", so the built in volume control is very nice."
came with a case to store them in and ear cushions in different sizes.
very nice product for it's price point.
"i bought two pairs of these, one for me (black and red) and one for my son (grey and blue).  "
my son's pair stopped connecting with his phone about three and a half weeks into use.  
"i attempted to pair it with my iphone, his iphone, my ipad (apple fan), my laptop, my wife's laptop, all with no success.  "
i placed the return to amazon.  
"four days later, now my pair will not connect to any of the devices listed above.  "
"yes, i performed hard resets on all of the devices and that never solved the problem.  "
i've had this style of headset (not the same brand though) before and used them for just over a year until the battery in the headset would no longer hold a charge.  
"however, i will choose another brand next time around as two headsets going bad at almost the same time is too much of a coincidence for me to spend more money with that company again."
i loved this headphones and i would let you know all the reasons why you would love them too:1) size & comfort-
"the size is really nice because isn't too big, lightweight, and you get different sized cushions for your comfort.2)"
sound quality-
"the sound quality is so amazing, like expensive headphones quality."
they're really noise cancelling and they can reach great high volume without affecting the sound quality.3)
battery durability-
"they charge fast(like 25-30mins) and they last like 8 hours, i tested them.(red light="
"charging, blue light=fully charged)4"
) style- you've different colors to buy the one that suits your own style.5)
price-
"they can be more expensive because of their quality, so you would love to get a cheap product with the same quality and features than expensive ones."
i recommend them!
"plus, you get them in a nice case."
it's all just like described.
i attached some pictures showing them.
"off a full charge of these things, they easily lasted the advertised 8 hours.  "
"while running, they did stay on my ears, and the medium ear pieces allowed me to still hear traffic.  "
for $20 this maybe be enough reason to buy them.  
but i dislike the rubberized cord which ends up catching on my neck and tugging at my ears.  
"it is a little better if you use the included  cinching insert, but still does not entirely eliminate the tug when you turn your head.  "
sound is underwhelming.  
bass distorts and the midrange lacks power.  
"good enough for audio books, but if i am not running i'll go grab my other earbuds because they have much better sound"
but no over-the-ear hook.  
"ultimately i'm happy enough with these to keep using them for running, but if these are going to be your only pair, i think you get better value by spending a bit more.  "
"one last note, the remaining battery percentage does not seem to decrease linearly, making it a little hard to predict how much longer it will last.  "
no a big deal if you leave it charging when not in use.
the earbud headphones come with a small case that acts as a charger and storage case.  
"it took about 75 minutes to charge (within the case) and the lights let you know if it is charging, partially charged, or fully charged.  "
i like that the earbuds nestle securely into the case by strong magnets - especially good for traveling in a car or plane.  
it was quite easy to pair with my android phone and with my kindle.  
they were more comfortable that a couple of my other earbud headphones and rested well in my (small) ear.  
i really like that i can use just the main left earbud because i sometimes listen to stories to help me fall asleep and can sleep on my right side without that earbud pressing into the pillow - and no cords!i utilized the headphones for a phone call.  
"the caller's voice was very clear and loud, even though they told me they were speaking in a soft to normal tone.  "
there was full clarity with no static.  
"it is easy to use the single, large button on the side of the earbud to answer/end and raise volume."
"i then used the headphones to listen to a speak-to-text story on my kindle, which was a bit quieter than i would have liked at full volume, but i think that is due to the limitations of my kindle device.  "
"when i tried the headphones to listen to music from my amazon playlist through my phone, the volume was much better.  "
"the sound of my jazz guitarist was full and rich, coming through both stereophonic earbuds.  "
i was able to move away from the paired device (my phone) approximately 50 feet and around the doorway before the music began to break up a bit.
i'm hoping to use them for worship team practice since our music minister is going to wireless headphones for participants instead of a monitor for singer/musician aural feedback.  
i think these are a good set of headphones for the price.
these headphones technology works really well
but they are huge and super uncomfortable to wear.
"if you ever run outside in cold weather and wear headphones under your running hat, these will make you look like an alien."
my right ear felt sore during entire run despite multiple attempts to adjust the headphone.
"i don't care how good the technology is, if your ears hurt wearing them they don't deserve more than 2 stars."
it came in this black leather bag with additional ear plugs.
battery life is great.
i used it for listening to music for more than 5 hours and talktime for about an hour and still the battery hasn't drained completely.
"so far, so good!"
exactly as described.
different sizes for the ease pieces is nice because i don't like traditional ear buds stuck in my ear!
lightweight and comfortable.
the letscom earbuds are a pretty good option for wireless earbuds at this price point.
the sound isn’t as good as the apple airpods
but those will cost you $150.
also they won’t cancel all the noise around you but do a good job with a lot of it.
they come in black case which feels like leather.
i would assume it isn’t
but the case is nice.
they are very easy to sync up to an iphone.  
there are 3 different sizes of rubber tips for the earbuds which is nice for a custom fit in your ear canal.
the earbuds are comfortable to wear for the most part.
"i find if i wear them for an extended period of time, they will start to bother me."
i also have the comfort issue with my apple airpods.
i bought my first pair of these headphones and one of the ear buds stopped working after i tried to remove wax from it.
"i did enjoy the battery life and sound quality for the price, so i decided to buy another pair to replace the malfunctioning headphones."
my new pair lasted a couple months at most and then simply turned off and wouldn't turn on.
"i had just charged them earlier in the day, so i don't think they shut down due to low battery."
i have spent $40 on two pairs of these headphones and they lasted a total of maybe 5months at that.
i would have been better off getting a more durable set of higher quality headphones.
"the list price of these headphones is cheap, but they won't last."
volume buttons don't work well
but i just use the volume on my phone.
use these to tread water in a pool while listening to podcasts and they work great.
headphones are great.  
they stay in my ears.  
sound quality is good.  
plus i get get several hours of use before a recharge is necessary.
these are the best cheap bluetooth earbuds i've purchased!
i have tried probably 6 different brands on amazon.
"my favorites had been the soundpeats q30, but they were just good enough - not great."
"these letscom came highly recommended by someone i know, so i thought i'd give them a try."
i had been using my son's airpods (because they were better than the soundpeats
and he wasn't using them)
so i had something of quality to compare them to.
"they are definitely more noise-canceling than airpods, and they're louder."
"the sound quality is only slightly less than airpods, but not enough to complain about."
"i do wish they had a richer bass sound, as i like to listen to music with a lot of bass."
"but overall, the sound quality is very good."
"at first i didn't think they were that great, but once i changed out the ear piece things, they fit just right in my ears and the sound was loud."
i actually had to turn the volume down a bit because they were too loud.
my favorite feature is the side button that lets me pause the music
so i can talk without removing the earbuds.
i do wish i was able to change out the piece that goes over top of the ear for a smaller one.
"i have small ears and that piece doesn't quite fit right around the top of my ears, but it's not much of an issue as the buds stay in nicely regardless."
"i liked these so much,"
i bought a pair for a gym buddy who lost his earbuds on the metro.
"he likes them too!seriously, just buy a pair."
you can't go wrong.
i have been trying and reviewing and reading tons of reviews on wireless earbuds and headphones.
"i had finally found some small earbuds i like and that actually have some decent bass response, but they just aren't going to stay put on the rare occasion i'm doing anything strenuous."
these will!
"with the comfortable soft rubber hooks that go behind your ears, these slip on very comfortable for extended wear."
"(extended = about 3 straight hours, very comfortable, no strain)all"
the controls are on the right side and are pretty simple and intuitive.
"a center main multi button, and a simple up and down button."
now lets talk about sound and bass!
these have it all!
"absolutely the best sound quality of anything i've tried so far, including my over the ear full type headphones!!"
"plenty of volume as well, like, a lot of volume!i absolutely love these and they are my main earbuds now."
"if you're in the market for some amazing bluetooth headphones, you really should try these, you won't regret it at all."
"oh yeah, the handy little carrying case is a very cool added little bonus as well."
"it's well made and offers really good protection for these little gems!oh, i got the green and black ones and love the look too!"
i didn't add pictures because they are the same as the many already shown.
"if you're still here, i'm going to say it one more time, buy these!!"

"if you're still here, i'm going to say it one more time, buy these!!"
i have had two pairs of the headphones now.
the first pair was lost on a trip so i immediately bought another pair.
"these are fairly well-built, bluetooth headphones that work best either in a gym or office situation."
"i have had the best of luck with them when listening to audiobooks on audible, or various podcasts."
"their music performance is fine, but the drivers could be improved slightly for dubstep and metal (which i happen to listen to)."
"they can be a little problematic if you wear glasses as the ""hoops"" tend to get pushed away from the ears (which really isn't a huge con, which is why i didn't list it)."
below are my pros and cons after using these headphones for several months.
pros:- the price for a pair of fairly reliable bluetooth
headphones-
"the audio drivers work well for audiobooks, and does deliver some decent bass (although they can be tinny at times).-"
they're relatively comfortable once you find the earpieces that match your ears.- have some noise-cancellation which makes them decent for office use or gym use.
cons:-
the plastic/rubber on the headphones
"smell horrible when you open the package, leftover vapors from manufacture process."
"fortunately, this goes away if you let them air out"
"overnight.- can be a little tinny at times when listening to music like metal, djent, and dubstep.-"
"the earpieces will adjust and get smaller over time, and can slip out.-"
"i get a ""battery low"" message over and over again after it states that the headphones have 70% charge left on them"
(this happened on both pairs that i bought).
i was agreeably delighted with this excellent bargain.
well worth the modest price!
pros and cons:pros:- very fine sound.
"surprisingly fine, rich highs and lows, better than other earbud-type headsets"
i have experienced.- light
weight.-
the assortment of earbuds that come with the headphones allow for a custom
fit.-
"the ear hangers lay very lightly on the top of the ear, and support the earbuds securely, so they have no tendency to slip out of your ears."
this is a terrific feature.
cons:-
"the headphones seem sort of flimsy, but time will tell.- the volume switch is tiny, difficult to find with your finger, and difficult to manipulate."
but it works ok.-
an led is red while charging and blue when charged.
"that is ok, but in use, the blue led flashes periodically, an annoyance if you wear the headphones at night.- charging is via a usb cable."
"the usb cable that comes with the headphones is only about 1' or 30 cm long, but it works.- one must open a tiny rubber hatch to expose the charging port, a standard cell phone type."
"inserting the supplied cable, or any cable of the same type, into the metal port is awkward and difficult."
i recommend these headphones.
"if they fail in some way after a period of use, i will update this review."
was not expecting such good quality for the price
but they are amazing.
"a blue light blinks when you’re using them, which was a minor issue because i sometimes use them as i go to sleep."
just took out the right one and stuffed it under the pillow.
"for sure, i wasn't expecting much from $20 bluetooth headphones.  "
"in this case, i was mistaken .  "
i wore them for a complete 40 minute  elliptical workout while listening to some hypno sounds.  
the sound was fantastic.  
the fit was almost perfect.  
i find that when you wear earbuds with over the ear clips that sometimes they will irritate your ears after a while.  
i did feel a little of this discomfort
but this is also the first time i've worn a pair with over ear clips in years.
they provided true stereo with good base and background noise was not noticable.  
"when i finished my workout, during my cool down, i put on the doors; riders on the storm and i actually looked outside when the background thunder started.  "
"connecting them was easy and with a little getting used to, managing the the small volume control is easy.  "
"i have not used them for answering the phone but like most earbuds,"
i sure that would be easy too.
on these you short press the mfb to answer and hang up.  
i am impressed.  
i have now worn these ear buds for at least 4 hrs a day since getting them.  
i am still completely impressed that such inexpensive earbuds can work as good as the heavy hitters for much less
"sound is ok, construction looks good, and the features are fine.  "
"but these headphones, or at least the set i received, struggled to receive bluetooth signals from more than 18 inches away or so.  "
"my phone hits many other bluetooth devices from up to 15 feet,"
so i know it's not that.  
"even carrying my phone in my pocket, the sound repeatedly drops out momentarily, sometimes 3-4 times in a couple of seconds.  "
it's maddening!  
"which pocket i carry my phone in, whether it is right side up or upside down - it all matters, but nothing makes it perfect other than carrying my phone in my breast pocket.  "
"i didn't expect anything great for the price, but these have failed to meet even that low expectation."
"i bought a pair, one for my daughter and one for my son to use on a flight."
my daughter  said they were “ok.”
i like the handy storage case and ease of pairing with tablet.
"i have been looking for a pair of wireless head phones for a while now, and after mush hesitation, i figured that i'd give this a chance"
and i have to say that i am really impressed.
i use the head phones mostly for work and in my car to use it with my phone.
i haven't tried to dip them in the water
so i can'r speak for it's water proof claim.
the noise is very clear.
"if you are listening to music and a call comes in, it automatically puts the music on hold."
"the battery life is amazing on this, i have had used it for two days with full days of meeting without having to charge."
i like that the strap goes behind my ear
so i can just yank them and rest them on my shoulders if need be.
"overall, a good decent buy for the price."
i bought these because i work out frequently and wanted some wireless headphones to accompany me to the gym.
i also needed good sound quality (i'm a professional vocalist and can't stand crappy sound) but didn't want to spend a kidney on headphones.
i purchased these
and i love them!pros:-
they stay in place
while working out!!!!
soooo important.
it's so annoying when you're in your stride
and you have to stop to readjust your headphones.
"i've had these about 3 months, and have never had an issue with them slipping off mid-workout."
"running, hiit, strength training, circuit training..."
i have had zero issues.-
the sound is pretty good for <$30 bluetooth headphones.
sometimes it does do this thing where the sound is more mono - kinda like a lower frequency - but that's normally right after pairing.
when i first bought them i ran into this issue and was ready to return them because the sound sounded like crap.
tinny and thin.
"but after re-pairing them, the sound was great."
"so if you have this issue, make sure they're fully charged and try to re-pair them with your device."
the sound should resolve itself.-
the noise cancelling properties of these bad boys is awesome for a <$30 pair of bluetooth headphones.
i have a roommate who talks nonstop
(she's horrible at reading social cues) and these do a great job of drowning her out - even at low volume.-
"this may be weird, but i actually like that they have a connecting wire."
"when i'm not listening to anything, i'll typically unpair them and power them off to save battery power and just let them hang around my neck."
they stay there.
"they did come with a really nice carrying/storage case, but i just use that as a coin purse now so hanging them around my neck is great."
lolcons:-
"if you sweat, you'll feel it."
"i don't really sweat a lot, but i know a lot of ppl that do"
and i could imagine the backs of the ears kinda feeling gross and sweaty with these on.-
the battery life could be better.
i'd say they last about 5 to 6 hours of consistent use
and then they need to be charged again.
for some people this may be a non-issue.
"for someone like me who constantly uses them to listen to music and other content, it can be annoying to have to pause listening or watching something to charge and then repair them"
"but on the bright side, they charge pretty quickly."
i'd say 30 minutes of charging time and they're good for another 5 to 6 hours.-
they don't come with a charger.
"or maybe just mine didn't, but"
it's no big deal because it uses a micro-usb cord
and i'm an android user
so i have tons of those laying around.
"it was a non-issue for me, but for an apple user or a newer android user who has a usb-c connector, it could be an annoyance."
something to consider.
"all in all, these are worth the money."
"4 stars out of 5 for the cons mentioned, but overall excellent headphones."
"if you're on the fence, i'd say get 'em!"
they'll probably be sufficient for your needs!
"the headphones offer an entire range of sound, great bass, and crisp detail."
"with other headphones, that i have, there have been 3 major issues."
"poor bass quality, constant cutting out and having to rely on my phone for all the volume (and keeping it all the way up to 11)."
this is not the case with the ipx7's.
now i have to keep the volume on my phone at around 1/2.as an added bonus
the call quality has been top notch.
people can here me as clearly as when i am wired.
"with all of my previous headsets, i didn't even bother trying to talk."
i also take a lot of voice dictations when i am outside walking.
so far they are far more accurate than with my other setups
i wasn't sure what to expect ordering these but what an awesome surprise!!!!  
omg
i don't know where to start
but i will:->
the packaging is beautiful!  
i know
that seems trivial
but it really it very pretty and durable box.  
everything is black and its very sheek  looking.->
the case is adorable!  
perfect size not too small where you lose but not too large that it takes up any room when traveling.  
it's a hard case so dropping it isn't a problem
either.-
>
the fit is perfect!  
they come with 3 different
ear sizes
so those that need the small or larger sizes can adjust to their liking.  
the fit very comfortably inside the ear and don't fall out.  
i use mine at the gym
and they still fit very snugly without having to constantly readjust.->  
they charge fast!  
charging fast is very important to me as i use these a lot
"and i often times forget to charge them, so when i do remember a quick 15-20 min charge last a long time.-> sound quality is clear!!  "
the sound quality is top notch.  
i don't hear anything else going on around me when i have these turned up and there is no crackling or fuzzy noise sounds when i use these.
there really isn't anything that i don't like about these!  
"as a matter of fact i've already ordered my son and my daughter a pair, they tried mine and they're trying to steal them but for this price and the quality i can easily afford to get them their own."
two part review
":i've never wore headphones in the shower before, these had said ""waterproof,"" i was curious."
"i'm one of those people who does watch stuff in the shower, so i wanted to try these out to enhance the experience."
i don't know if they are truly waterproof
but they still worked after i showered with them.
in fact days later still working without any issues.
"the sound is very good, they fit into my ears quite well."
i bought these mainly because my wife is clumsy.
"she works in nyc, and dropped one of the earbuds onto the subway."
"so i got her these because they are wired, good battery life, and they clip over the ear for security."
she's been using them for a few days and love them.
"they are solid, great sounding, and they even come with a nice case to house the headset."
"earbuds are the cool thing right now, but these cost less than half than most of the earbuds and sound twice as good."
the battery life is just killer.
for $20 these are hard to beat.
great for the active person.
get yourself these letscom headsets.
you won't regret it.
"rather individual earbuds, i always prefer a wired bluetooth headsets to not to fall down due to some reason."
hence i preferred this headset.
it cams up with a box to keep charging cable and headphone.
the design is very good.
setup and pair the headset is very easy and it deduct the devices within a seconds.
it also connect automatically when you turn the headset next time with the device that you connected last time.
the sound quality is excellent and easy to adjust the volumes by pressing the low/high buttons.
by pressing the multi function button can easily pause the play and next time press the button resume your play.
it fit in the ear properly and feel much comfortable when listen the music.
"while charging, an led indicator sings in red color and signs in blue color when its fully charged."
battery backup also good as far as an average of 4 hours a day for the past few days.
a nice headset with this price!!!.

i have a similar pair of bluetooth headphones that i've used a few times per month for several years.
"my old set do not have noise cancelling, the ""next song"" and ""previous song"" functions are clunky and the whole ui is unintuitive."
"as i needed to purchase a gift for a family member, i did some research on the features i wish i had and decided on these letscom headphones which have everything i was looking for."
"after giving my dad a week to test these out, he confirmed they are indeed amazing as the reviews tout and sound fantastic."
a win-win since these cost only a fraction of the price of my old set!
he loves the micro usb charging port and how lightweight these are.
his ears do not work with the apple air/earpods as they constantly fall out even without moving around much.
these headphones stay in his ears perfectly even while exercising.
the multiple sized
ear inserts are a great example of the high level of detail that was put into the design.
highly recommend
and i intend to purchase a set for myself!
i did receive this product for free for my honest opinion.
i immediately liked the feel and look of these earphones.
"they work well, even sound great for being so small, the only thing is be careful for the instructions because i thought i had a defective piece"
"but it was fine, just follow the instructions."
"the packaging was very great and sleek looking, the box it comes with for charging has magnetic holders for the earphones which works wonderfully."
one thing that i noticed which might be just a phone issue is that sometimes there is skipping when the phone is in my pocket
but otherwise i can leave my phone and go down the hall and the range is good.
i personally recommend the earphones based on my experience.
i got these for working out and for listening to music at night without waking my hubby.
"there isnt a clip to attach to your clothes, so if you're going to crazy town during your workout, they're likely to fall off if they dont fit just right."
"i have very microscopic ears, so unfortunately they don't stay on very well."
"(but i haven't ever found any pair that does fit, so it shouldn't be a concern unless you have baby ears.)"
"that said, they are comfortable."
"most headphones that rest on my ears hurt, but these don't."
they're kinda soft and pliable around the ear loop thing.
the sound quality during workouts is fine.
its loud and kinda drowns out the din of treadmills at the gym.
there is a static undertone if you're listening to music for the sake of listening to music that gets a bit annoying.
"i listen to relaxation tunes at night and its like a hum of static, at first i thought it was background rain sounds."
lol.
"not horrible, just soft and there constant white noise."
"so if pure sound quality isnt a problem, these will be fine."
"like i said, they are loud and noise cancel fine!"
"i ordered these headphones specifically for working out -- i was using beats solos, but they were far too bulky and harder to clean after getting sweaty."
these headphones are lightweight and came with a convenient little case (that also stores a charging cord)
so they are easy to pack up and bring to the gym.
i found it very easy to connect these headphones to my phone via bluetooth; the directions that came with the headphones are simple and clear.
"these headphones have great sound quality, and even at 25-30% of full volume, i find they effectively cancel out noise from my surroundings."
"i prefer to use these for weight lifting or core exercises, routines that don't involve a lot of sudden, jerky movement."
"i notice that when i'm deep into my workout, the moisture wicking feature doesn't really hold up."
"i often have to take the buds out of my ears and wipe them off, and they will fall out of my ears if i don't dry them off manually."
"i have pretty small ears and have trouble finding earbuds that fit me properly (including apple headphones), so i do not believe this fit issue is unique to this particular brand of headphones."
these are a great value for headphones!
"if you're looking for a quality pair of headphones that provide great sound without breaking the bank, i would highly recommend purchasing these."
i love the fact that i can pop one ear bud in and hear just fine while also being alert to my close surroundings for safety.
i also love how easy it is to place these earbuds around my neck and pop them in and out my ear as needed.
this is as i wireless as i get because i know how easy it is to lose those other wireless blutooth devices.
"my only complaints are this device picks up background noise better than my own voice according to people i speak with and my other small problem is, it doesnt stay on place when i only wear one ear."
it begins pulling and sticking to your neck.
i always just stick side that has no ccntrols under my bra strap.
works great!!!!
"pros:decent sound quality, pretty sound battery life, fits perfectly."
"cons:tedious costumer service, easily broken, cord is annoying, whistles in wind."
more details:
"sound quality, if your the sort of person who really cares about this then"
it’s not for you.battery life if you want something to last you all day this is not for you(1 to 2 recharges if used all day each takes an hour).
fits perfectly in the ear it has options that cover the needs of 98% of people who buy it.
"cons rant:these headphones would usually last me just outside the warranty, so this time i got the protection plan so that if it broke i could have it replaced, so when one day i find one side is ten times quieter than the other normal side."
"so i look for the email i was supposed to use when they needed to be replaced, it was never sent."
"mistakes happen whatever, so i go to my orders in amazon app"
and i get and
error message
when i try to contact manufacturer for the protection plan(it was just this order that wasn’t working)managed to get general costumer service to tell them my situation when it is obvious it needs to be replaced we switch to phone.
"i told them i wanted a replacement he said he would be happy to help and asked me to hold as he connected me to the protection plan agency, took 20 minutes... only to be put on the line with the most condescending person i have ever met, summary was they couldn’t lift a finger to keep there end of the bargain because it was still within the warranty."
"the person the line apologised and said he would take care of the problem, full instant refund i agreed just wanting it to be over(didn’t"
want to wait another 20 minutes to get connected to the headphone company).
i get a full 2 dollar refund of the plan and had to go through the process of sending in the headphones to get a refund(wanted a replacement) been a week since i sent it in no response.
"if you fall asleep using these they might break, if you take them outside on a cold day they will break, if you drop them too many times they might break, if you fall and they are in your pocket they will break, if you accidentally step on them because they give you the tiniest charging cord possible they will break(even in slippers)."
these are great for you if you are the most careful person in the world.
i’ve always got these for the price i’ve had 5 by now...
"if you have to cord in the front it wraps on it’s self, in a way that is uncomfortable and looks weird, if you have the cord in the back and are not equally ambidextrous in every part of your movement, then the cord condemns you to awkward one sided cord where it is so far to one side that looking towards it pulls out the headphone, and looking away feels awkward and further pushes it to that side."
unless you don’t move your head you’ll have to reset it every 15 to 20 minutes.
"if you plan to go biking with these don’t, just don’t."
or if you want to use these outside and you don’t live it a city
the whistling will be so loud and varying that listening to anything is near impossible unless you’re ok travelling about keeping your head permanently to the right or left to mitigate the whistling.
if there was a reason to buy these it’s probably for the price or
it’s expendability.
thanks for reading my rant hope
it could help.and company
"if you’re reading this my review can’t be bought, at best an update if you fix my problem and fix your product."
these are fairly comfortable headphones to wear but have pretty terrible battery life.  
i only get a few hours of listening to music or phone calls on these before the battery dies on a 100% charge.  
if i connect them to my phone and the phone reports them at 70% battery
then i know i only have a few minutes before they die.  
i didn't notice this the first day i had them
but i've only had them for 7 months and this issue has frustrated me for several months so the battery issue started early.
when the battery is charged the headphones seem fine however they don't seem any better than other headphones i've had.  
"lots of other headphones are better in battery life, noise cancelling, sound quality, comfort, etc..."
so i'd skip these and look at other options.
"let me start by saying i use headphones at work, all day, every day.  "
"these are  not only uncomfortable, but no matter which way i moved them around"
"they wouldn't plug up to provide the ""noise isolation"" that these style ear pieces usually provide.  "
"even with trying the different size plugs, no go.  "
the sound quality is meh at best.  
but my biggest complaint is the lowest volume setting is far too loud for any quiet environment.  
"save your money, buy the skullcandy bluetooth set instead.  "
far better sound quality
and they actually plug up
for $18 and change these are pretty good.
bluetooth earphones have really come a long way.
i have another cheap chinese pair of bluetooth earphones from about 10 years ago and they dont nearly sound as good or stay in the ear as well.
pros:1.
good volume2.
comes with many different size ear plugs to try3.
available in many different colors4.
good bass response5.
easy to use controls6.
comes with a free carrying case and usb cord7.
good price!cons:1.
the over the ear piece is not adjustable so it does not fit snug if you have small ears2.
sound quality overall is just average3.
for such a small device it takes longer to charge than expected(1.5-2 hours)4.
average usage time on full charge
love them!
"you can register for a free one year warranty, so"
i know i won't have to buy another pair this year which is fantastic.
"great sound quality, and very loud."
my old earbuds were twice the price and didn't sound nearly as good.
i'm no expert here
but i went from listening at around 80% of full volume to around 10%.
"if you like loud, you'll get it here."
super easy for a non techie like me to pair.
"seriously, took less than a minute from opening the instruction book to playing my music."
comes with a great little carrying case.
"i probably won't use it much because i don't go anywhere, but if i was taking them to work or on trips i'd definitely use it."
"overall, can't think of anything i'd change!"
very pleased with quality for the price.
"my husband's $200 beats stopped bluetoothing after about 3 months, right outside the return window."
i can't believe these have a better warranty for such a low price.
i was thinking of getting a more expensive pair
but i'm super happy
i saved my money.
"i really wanted to love these headphones, and i did for the first few months."
"however, recently, i've noticed a lot of interruptions and disruptions in sound."
i noticed it first while riding my road bike.
"every time i turned my head to the left, the sound cut out."
"it didn't happen when i turned my head to the right, and it didn't happen every time i turned my head to the left."
"then, it started doing the same thing on my walks and runs."
"and then, it started doing it randomly (without me even turning my head)."
"on today's run, the sound cut off completely and i had to turn my bluetooth off then on again on my phone to get it to re-connect."
this is seriously annoying.
the second thing i really dislike is that there's no indication of battery power left.
"too many times, i'll have them on when i'm grocery shopping - listening to an audiobook."
"and then i get the dreaded ""low battery"" notification."
"the headphones state that 5-6 times, in rapid succession, and then simply shut down."
"you get, maybe, 10-15 minutes after the first notification before they shut down."
"on the positive, the sound quality is really good and they connect quickly to the phone."
it's nice not to have to fiddle with a connection when i want to use them.
"overall though, i wouldn't buy these again."
i am now saving my money for a pair that will fix the two issues i mentioned above.
i bought these primarily for use at the gym.
based on the other reviews on here
i thought that they might not be as cheap as the price tag might imply.
in some ways they are.
out of the box they are very simple and easy to set up.
the control buttons are pretty easy and intuitive as well.
the two main issues that i have with these earbuds are the sound quality and moisture issues.
"first if i want to listen to music at normal levels, the volume needs to be turned down to about 15%."
"when increasing the volume, every click up on the volume button is a dramatic increase in volume output."
essentially this means that i can only listen at one volume level (15%) before the sound is over-amplified and uncomfortable.
the quality of the sound is what you would expect for $20 bluetooth earbuds.
"it's nothing great, but fine for gym workouts and such."
"the sound is best at the 15% volume level, and anything else becomes very tinny and noisy."
i definitely have other corded earbuds in the same price range which sound much better.
the other big issue i've had with these earbuds is issues with sweat.
"they are advertised as sweat proof, but it seems that anytime i do a hard workout, the sweat in my ear causes one of the earbuds to shut off an stop functioning."
"once they dry out both will function again properly, but it's a real annoyance to deal with in the middle of a workout."
"it seems to always be the right earbud, so perhaps i just got a defective product."
"if i hold down both volume buttons, google assistant comes up on my phone.  "
this is awesome because i can ask google questions without having to find my phone.  
😂
"i tend to favor wireless earbuds over earbuds that go over your ear, but these have been a godsend lately.  "
my 2 year old always thinks he needs to take out my earbuds.  
these are much harder for him to remove.  
"if he manages to remove it (kids are fast!), the other side is still connected to my ear and he can't immediately lose it.  "
the part that goes over your ear is less rigid than others like it.  
it's flexibly makes it more comfortable.  
"i still find wireless earbuds to be more comfortable, but if you have little hands who think they need to take your earbuds, these are definitely for you."
"for the price, there's no comparison."
amazon choice for a reason.
"battery life is as advertised or better; about 8-12 hours of continuous use before it warns you ""battery low."""
gives about 3 warnings in a 2 minute period then dies.
don't get caught without your charger.
"only 3 buttons, so ""long press"" and ""short press"" come into the equation for volume and track skipping."
"only con is on occasion, the button for ""skip forward"" changes to ""skip backward,"" and vice versa."
"at first i thought i was crazy, but you'll be listening to a playlist, skipping tracks"
"when suddenly, you go to skip a track and the same button you'd been using to go forward"
"becomes back, and back becomes forward."
"not enough of an issue to scrap the whole headset, but it does keep it from being 5 stars, because although these aren't going to impress an audiophile,"
the fact that you're considering a $20 pair of bluetooth headphones means we prob have the same audio standards.
these sound great.

these sound great.
i bought these headphones in feb 2019 and replaced them in oct 2019.
"however, that's only because i waited to replace them two months longer than i should have."
around aug 2019 the left ear bud stopped working
so i got about 6 months of good use from them
but the durability left much to be desired.
i know they are relatively cheap headphones
but i've had headphones of the same price last way longer.
they are definitely not noise cancelling.
"when i had them in i could still hear every sound in the gym unless i turned them up to full volume, which i don't recommend as that can damage hearing."
"that's fine though, because i didn't expect them to be good at noise cancellation."
they weren't good at moisture wicking  at all.
the one area they did excel was in the battery lift category.
i would charge them on monday for about an hour and wouldn't have to charge them till after my workout on thursday.
that was when i was working out all five weekdays for about 1.5 hours a day.
when i switched to a three day weightlifting schedule then i could use them all three days off of one charge.
"overall, they are good for a transition pair, or if you're ok replacing them often."
i bought these bluetooth headphones to use while running.
i was looking for something that was affordable but also good quality.
these gave me everything i wanted!
"you can't beat the price, and they work really well."
"the connection is great, and they connect to my phone almost immediately when i turn them on."
they have great volume and good sound quality.
i like that the ear pieces are connected by a slim cord so that i can wear them around my neck when not using them.
i love the black/grey color because they look sleek and simple.
"they also fit pretty snugly in my ears and have an over-the-ear piece, so i don't have to worry about them falling out while running."
there are also different size
ear pieces
if you need to change them.
"when connected to your phone, there is a battery display icon to show you how much battery is left, which is very nice."
the carrying protective case is a nice added bonus and good quality.
"overall, this is a great product and definitely worth the money!"
these were my fist pair of bluetooth head phones i purchased.  
"i was skeptical of the sound quality and fit when i first purchased them, but was delightfully surprised.  "
"as far as sound quality goes, for the price you are paying you are getting a quality sound.  "
"the speaker do great with midrange sounds, but they do some richness in the lower frequencies.  "
same goes for anything in the higher range.  
"most people will not even notice any sound quality degradation, unless they are use to using higher end headphones/earbuds.  "
they fit of the earbuds
is extremely comfortable; the set come with three different sized buds.  
"i have used them for several high intensity workouts, and have not have any issues with them slipping out of my ears.  "
"as these are my first bluetooth headphones, i was very impressed with the range of the signal.  "
controls on the  right
ear bus are also easy to use.  
overall these are very worth the price.
actually great product for the price.looks pretty .
noise cancellations is a plus and water proof.  
the sound quality is good with music same thing goes to call quality.
no interruptions with the connections and it is easy to pair.
i can go as far as 5 feet away from my device and it is still do the job done.
another thing is it comes it more extra earbuds and cute little case.
so far i love it.
the battery is quite good to.
i have been using it for more than 24hours on and off with out charging it .i have been using it while watching my netflix on my ipad while cooking
so i have to go back and forth
and it doesn't disconnect .maybe
the only thing i can say that the thing that you hooked in the ear is a little big for me.
i hope its an adjustable so it can fit perfecty.
"i wear this on the train going into nyc, but i'm on a 'quiet' car so there is little to no background noise anyway...."
"however, when off the train, i have to walk 6 city blocks.  "
these are not noise cancelling ear buds
but they are pretty good.  
they drown out the city noise
"but i think if you were looking to eliminate that crying baby on an airplane, these might not work so well.  "
i think it's partly because they don't have a very high volume allowance.  
but for the price i would highly recommend them.  
i charged them on sunday and today is thursday
and i think i've listened to about 5-6 hours and just now have to charge them.  
the only thing i wish it would do is maybe have the lights on the outside of the case indicate when the battery is low on them....
otherwise i'm not sure how you know when you need to charge them again.

i love these over the ear design for serious sport use.  
they take the pressure off the ear canals and keep the earbuds from falling out when it become wet.
build quality is nice.  
it's light and the ear hook is of a soft rubberized hook.  
there is a dedicated multi function button (mfb) to control everything and separate volume buttons.
did a 5k run with them and had no issue.  
paired it w/
"my tomtom spark + music and i was off and running, tracking my stats and listening to music w/o having to carry my phone."
sound quality is good for music and phone calls.
connectivity is quick and simple to ios or android.
these buds served it purpose in its price range.
i had to purchase a second pair due to my cat chewing through the wire on my first pair.
"now, my first pair was great-"
they fit comfortably in my ears & the sound was perfect even if i left my phone in the front of the gym & walked all the way to the other side.
no cutting out or anything.
"that being said, my second pair is the total opposite."
i cannot keep the left ear phone in my ear for the life of me despite trying each size
ear
bud-
i am constantly messing with it throughout my entire workout.
the connectivity is terrible too.
if i walk not even 15 feet away from my phone the sound starts to break up and if i go even a little further it loses connectivity completely.
i’m very disappointed in my second pair especially because i was expecting to have a good product just like the first pair i bought.
i’m planning on returning these and buying a much more reliable pair of earphones from a different company.
"the wireless buds are amazing for the price, connecting it to my pixel phone was super easy and sound quality is really good..with jazz and country music"
"i think this pair of earbuds is amazing, coming to the charging case it holds 2 charge cycles which is pretty easy for 3 days.."
"the material is really strong which will last for long..packing included additional buds of different sizes and a charging wire to charge, it came with a really nice packing from the seller..."
must try product !!
the earphones are good for the price; but beware--
"after only 2 months of use, the power button on my pair is no longer functioning properly."
i need to press and hold it several times from different angles for it to turn on/off.
"it also very frequently misreads a hold of the button as a short press, redialing the last number i called from my phone instead of powering down."
"i tried to return it my pair after owning it for just 2 months, but the return window closed after 1 month."
given the one-button design of the device (excluding volume up/down) this button malfunctioning is a pretty significant issue that heavily impacts the general usability of the earphones.
"i'm content with their sound quality, but being unable to properly power on or off the device after only 2 months of use is a big no-no."
"these ear buds have great range, i can put my phone in a central location inside the gym and still receive calls, music, etc...  "
"volume, song selection and phone controls are easy to reach and work great.  "
"the sound is very good while connected to my phone, my sansdisk mp3 player which has a blue tooth receiver plugged into it doesn't sound as good with a loss in fidelity"
"(yes, i know there is a loss of fidelity with the mp3 format to begin with).  "
i use these everyday and have had them for six months  and so far they are a solid product.
i also bought a second pair one week after i bought these.  
i gave them to my wife to use
and she kept them.  
so there you have it.
for starters i put 5 stars for moisture wicking because i’m assuming that it meant water resistant.
which it definitely is.
i work out with them
and i get extremely sweaty.
especially on my head.
and it hasn’t affected them at all.
"other than that, they are better quality all around, then what i expected for the price."
they aren’t the most hq crystal clear sound you might get from a pair of $200-$300 earbuds.
but i’ve got no complaints for $20.
and honestly they aren’t that far off quality wise.
the range is good too.
i’ve gone all the way across my house from my phone before the signal starts breaking.
which was about 30 feet.
even with a wall in between.
"i've had these a little over 2 months and used them only for running, about 3-4 hours total a week."
they just shut down about 5 minutes into a run and won't turn back on.
they were near full charge at the time.
i tried charging them for 24h+ thinking i just forgot to turn them off last time.
no luck.
i guess i shouldn't be too surprised for the price i paid...
sound quality was decent for the price.
i wouldn't mind having a pair that worked.
i've been using these for a week or two now
and i really like them!first of all
", i liked that they came with a small case."
it's perfect to throw in my gym bag.
they also come with different size earbuds.
"the product itself is very lightweight and flexible, so i'm not worried about them breaking."
they stay on my ear really well during my workouts and haven't had a problem with them falling out on their own.
i have accidentally pulled one out when putting my hair into a ponytail though.
the sound quality is the only reason i took off a star.
"it's not amazing sound quality, but it's not really bad either if that makes sense."
i wouldn't expect it to be great for headphones at this cost though.
"the quality doesn't really matter to me, especially when working out"
so it's fine.
i wouldn't want to pay about ten times the price for professional level sound.
i highly recommend these for anyone looking  for bluetooth headphones with good sound!
i am using letscom headphones from last few weeks.
"these are light-weight, super comfortable and stay in ears even during strenuous activities."
connectivity is easy and 100% accurate and easier to operate with controls given.
not to miss the sound quality - they are surprisingly good and bass is super rich and much better than my older expensive earbuds and headphones.
headphones have noise cancellation and they are good specially when volume is high and music has a lot of bass.
case that came with package is adorable.
these headphones are great deal considering low affordable price and good sound quality.
i would love buying them again.
"sound wasn't bad, though"
the ear plugs are a tad small for my ears.  
"the ear hoops keep them secure, though, even when running.  "
the problem is they aren't terribly sweat proof.  
"within two weeks, they started randomly changing volume and skipping thru tracks, and by week four they stopped charging consistently.  "
i'm guessing sweat got inside and shorted something out.  
now they've stopped connecting via bluetooth for more than about twenty seconds.
i had another pair of these that got me about six months.
"these, not so much.  "
guess i'll find out if their warranty is worth anything.
i had a pair of $20 bluetooth headphones that i had tried previously before these and these headphones were a lot better than those.
i love the sound quality and how it cancels out the hustle bustle going around me and how long the battery life is.  
i had a pair of $20 bluetooth headphones that i had tried previously before these and these headphones were a lot better than those.
i love the sound quality and how it cancels out the hustle bustle going around me and how long the battery life is.
i had to replace them when they broke in my backpack
but i should have put them in the little pouch that they include in the order.
surprisingly this sounds better than my 60$ sennheiser headphones.
you cant ask for more at 20 $ rangepros:
good sound quality for the pricebass is  
3.5/5call quality was good
", i took an indoor call"
so dont know how it performs outdoor.
"fit is very comfortable, i watched a 2.5 hour movie with this set and it didnt give any ear pain."
"cons:this uses a bluetooth 4.1 which is little older now, it does not make many noticeable difference thoughsome people might find the ear hooks little odd for long hours of use.this is not an audiophile headphone"
but it works very good for all purposes and when you evaluate features against cost its amazing.
i mean — there are very inexpensive so my expectations were not too high.
they pair easily and fast with my phone.
the controls are good.
they are very lightweight.
the fit could be better — i tried all the earpads and none really seem to fit snugly.
the earhooks do a good job though sometimes they seem to float above my earlobe and not really grab on.
the earhooks are not adjustable.
the sound is ok.
my biggest complaint is that i actually cant turn them down enough.
there appears to be a low decibel setting that i cannot go under.
so i dont like to blast music into my ears and when running
"i actually like them pretty low — just to get a beat going that i can keep pace to in the background and still be able to hear traffic, other people, etc."
around me..i tried these on the very lowest volume setting and it is too loud actually.
my iphone is set to the lowest volume setting and
nothing i do seems to make them any lower.
i had a pair of beats powerbeats wireless before this
and i was able to dial the sound down to a whisper.
otherwise these do the job and they werent expensive.
but if i cant get the volume any lower i might have to look into another brand.
i use these ear buds when i walk on the track at my rec. center.
they sound great!
no problem with pairing them to my phone.
i have never had a problem with battery life.
"the noise cancellation is ok, i can easily understand someone walking beside me."
they stay in my ears pretty well even when i'm using the weight machines.
this is a great headset.  
got it in april and still working.  
just an fyi ..
a few times for some reason it won’t connect to my iphone.  
i went through the questions and answers and found out that you need to reset the bluetooth connection.
"go to bluetooth in settings, on the right of the u81 you will see a small blue circle.  "
select it and select “
forget this device”.  
turn on your headset again and it will find it ...
it will connecti’ve seen reviews and thought i’d share this because i thought it was broken too.  
but it’s not!
work great for the gym.  
"they stay on, no problem with sweat.  "
"sound is good for the price, very happy."
"the one thing that i don't like is that the battery charge does not display on the phone, unlike what it shows in the pictures.  "
there is no information about this in the manual or website.  
it just doesn't show and there's no information to troubleshoot or how to enable the feature.
i recently switched to bluetooth headphones with ear clips because each of my previous wireless headphones would eventually work their way out of my ear when exercising.  
ear clips fixed that
and they're not uncomfortable.
my previous ones were mpow
and i like these better.  
very similar design.  
both the ear clips (around your ear) and the ear tips (in your ear) for these letscom headphones are more comfortable than the mpow.  
"in addition, when they connect to your phone, there is a popup that comes on for about 3 seconds which tells you what percentage of charge is left.  "
it was always a guess with the mpows as there was no indicator and you got a warning about 5 minutes before they died.  
not very helpful when you wear them for an hour.
"unfortunately for these,  the 3 second popup when it connects is the only indicator of the charge state.  "
there is no battery capacity display like it shows in the description.  
maybe that's only iphones.  
i am running android 8.0 on a samsung s8.  
the popup is better than nothing.
i wear them 5-6 hours a week and have had them about 2 weeks on one charge.  
i haven't discharged them all the way yet.  
pretty happy with that.
pairing was super simple.
"notice that the noise cancelling is only for phone calls, not music.  "
"i haven't used them for phone calls, so i can't verify that it works."
"i'm not any great judge of sound quality, but they're not bad as far as i can tell.  "
"when i'm not exercising i use over the ear headphones and these letscoms can't compete with that, but the sound works for me when i'm in the gym or on my bike."
"overall, i'm very happy with the purchase.  "
we'll see how long they last!
these barely last 4 hours for me
and they hurt my ears.
i did a lot of research and these really seemed like the best ones.
unfortunately they're not.
update:
they are also now constantly dead.
"i charge them up, and if i don't use then the next day, they're dead."
update 2:
"this is a great company.. even though i must have received a faulty pair, the company refunded my money and sent me new version to try."
i'm going to give the new ones a try and will post another update.
update 3: the new ones are absolutely amazing..
i highly recommend them!https://www.amazon.com/dp/b07qgtvm2g
i purchased these a week ago because of the reviews and after a week of use i am thoroughly disappointed.
i gave this product a 2 only because i love purple.
everytime i'm talking to someone they ask if they're on speaker or i'm told i sound far off.
noise cancellation is none existing and
the continuous reconnecting is a bit ridiculous.
iwill return these and go back to my lg neck piece
my requirements aren't very demanding: i use these headphones mainly for audiobooks.
"they give a clear, crisp sound with plenty of volume available, and they stay on my head without making my ears itch."
that's perfect for me.
i hope they're more durable than the last three such devices i've purchased.
"they're a lot more comfortable than some others, and seem thus far to stay in place well."
it's also nice that they hired a native speaker of english to write their documentation.
"others i've had didn't bother to do that, and their meaning suffered."
good price for these ear buds.
good sound quality
and i can walk around listening to my audiobooks without having to hold my kindle in my hand.
havent had an issue with battery life.
"usually these ear buds don't stay in my ears well at all, even the ones made for smaller ears."
but these are not too uncomfortable.
"not something you could sleep in, and they do get a little uncomfortable after too long, but all ear buds do on me."
"it takes a little effort to get them in my ears, but once i do, they stay in pretty well."
"i would buy them again, esp at this price."
"i really loved these headphones, but a few weeks in they started shorting on one side."
i contacted the company & they gave me instructions for troubleshooting the issue.
"it initially worked, but a week later one side went out all together.  "
i emailed them back
& they sent me a replacement pair per the warranty they offer.
that was back in march or april
& i haven't had a single issue since.
"they are totally waterproof so far (rain,pool,bath, shower, no problem) ,the charge lasts well, & they are sturdy& comfortable.  "
you can't beat the price either.
i  highly recommend these.
these ear phones were okay.
"the sound was fine, but the design is pretty bad."
"i tried wearing these to replace my broken beats, but these were wayyy too big and uncomfortable for my ears."
the part that hooks around the ear was also like half an inch too tall for my ear
so it couldn't even sit comfortably.
"i use bluetooth headphones mostly for the gym, and not only were these impractical and kind of painful as they didn't fit, but they were so big and chunky that i was embarrassed to wear them."
i was so embarrassed that i took them off and would rather listen to the generic gym music than people see me wear this absolute headpiece.
"i recently needed to replace some more expensive headphones and thought i’d try these given the price and reviews, if i had to buy another pair in a year"
it wouldn’t break the bank.
unfortunately there are some major deal breakers and i had to return these.
dealbreakers: once it hits 30% battery it will remind you every minute
“battery low........
battery low....”
functionally reducing your usage to only 70% because you can’t keep using it with those interruptions.
"then related to the battery it does not hold a charge for long, if you need it for a few hours"
"then you’re good, but i’m a student and study most days."
i would rather not have to stop my study session to charge the headphones.
not a dealbreaker but not great
either is the sound.
"i would describe it as muffled, bass heavy."
i listen to a lot of podcasts
"and i had to adjust to the lower audio quality, which i did, but worth nothing."
"also, i have an iphone and this might be unique to me"
but i forget that non-apple headphones don’t get very quiet.
"the lowest volume setting is a few notches louder than i’m used to, but again i know most prefer louder."
"good things, the design works well."
i took them to the gym
and they didn’t fall out.
"the controls are helpful, although play/pause makes you push the headphones more into your ear so"
it’s slightly uncomfortable.
"for the price i was willing to sacrifice some things, but the battery alerts and battery life are dealbreakers for me."
if you’re okay with charging it on the regular then you’ll be fine and will ultimately save money with these.
"save money but put more effort, in the end not worth it for me."
update:
ok customer service sent me a replacement pair pretty quickly.  
"i used them for about 5 weeks 3-4 times per week, and now the same thing happened with the first pair.  "
"they don't take a charge (though the status light says it's charging), and i can't turn them on.  "
"i've reset them per the user manual, but they will not power on, they will not take a charge."
"so they are inexpensive, but the two sets i have tried, only last for 15-20 uses.  "
"therefore, cannot recommend."
paired easily with my android.  
sound was good.
"but after 5 workouts, they would not turn on, and would not take a charge.  "
"i tried to reset them per the instructions, and the earbuds would not respond."
customer service worked pretty fast to correct the situation.
i bought these to replace a pair i left at the gym.  
"of course my wife wanted a pair, so we got a blue and a green one.  "
both of them work great.  
"they hold a good charge for the size of the object, have a good range, charge quickly, and are cheap enough that you won't kick yourself (too hard) if they somehow get left on a treadmill and are not returned to the front desk.  "
they are cheap enough that you can even get one for your significant other in their favorite color
so they are less outraged that you want to replace your boneheadedly left-behind previous pair so quickly.
i have tried blue tooth ear buds before with out much success.  
"they were uncomfortable, constantly needing a charge, poor sound quality and on  and on.  "
i was however tire of getting tangled in my cord or inadvertently having them ripped from my ears.....
ouch!.  
"so, i researched and decided on these.  "
they are wonderful!  
i hardly know i have them on!  
"the sound quality is great, it is easy to adjust the volume from the one ear bud.  "
my friends tell me my calls are really clear.  
they were reasonable priced.  
i would certainly buy these again or give them as a gift!

felt uncomfortable around and in ears at first.  
i returned.  
company sent me a new set for free.  
"pairing and operation were great with both sets, and also sound was pretty good."
quick pairing with android phone and laptop for a skype call.  
"i’d say for me if i’m doing something else and not focusing on my ears, it’s fine."
i used on a call and the other person said sound was good.  
"also i tried two different sets of the knock-off white apple-style air buds, and these are much easier to use and sound better."
they look a bit odd as there are these boxes facing front and a little light flashing occasionally to show that they are on.  
but all in all i would recommend.
i was recently looking for wireless headphones to use with my pixel 3 xl.
i had been using the included pixel buds for exercise
but they suddenly stopped working for me
so i had to find a replacement.
i decided on these after reading reviews online (amazon and other third party websites) and have been very satisfied.
the sound quality is much better than expected for headphones at this price (significantly better than the pixel buds).
they fit quite snug in my ears but do tend to get a bit uncomfortable for me after extended wear (1 hour or more).
this may be do to my ear shape however.
they sit quite well in my ears even during intense exercise (sprinting).
i only have to reposition them on occasion.
i haven't used the other features of the headphones (control buttons)
so i cannot comment on them.
"overall for the price, its hard to go wrong with these headphones."
got these headphones to keep around as a cheap spare incase my main earbuds get lost or broken or whatever.
they shipped fast.
"great packaging, and it even comes with a handy carrying case!"
something that doesn't usually happen in this price range.
"audio quality isn't superb, but for the price they're about what you'd expect."
they look nice and they sit on your ears real well while you're doing things.
"i started the pairing process and they connected and started right up, battery life is great."
"overall nice headphones for the price, would buy again."
i bought these three months ago and have truly run them through their paces!
"i wear them at the office, at the gym, outside for runs, and at home."
"they do pretty well for calls, nice bass and full sound for music (i only like headphones with good bass), shows and podcasts."
i appreciate their long battery life and durability.
i also love how the cord doesn’t get tangled when i toss it in my purse or car console.
"they’re also very comfortable, they don’t hurt, and they stay in my ear-"
"it’s so hard to find earbuds that fit my small ears, sometimes after a while other headsets will make inside my ears ache even if they start out comfortable."
"one thing that i would improve is that when the battery is low, the notification could be earlier, and less startling/intrusive (a robotic voice says the battery is low, repeatedly and incessantly, and then they die within a couple minutes.)"
"that said, they do hold a charge for a long time and charge up quickly!i also can’t use them to talk on the phone if there is background noise at all-"
my callers can’t hear me well
"if i’m in the car or in a crowd (i.e. at the store),"
but i also haven’t had any bluetooth earbuds that are good for talking
so i wasn’t upset about that especially for what i need them for at this price!haven’t
had any issues connecting to multiple devices
and i expect them to last a while.
these work great for a reasonable price.
no issues so far.
"i love these earbuds, it really stay in your ear."
i use them when i work out!
these earbuds will stay in your ear no matter what position you are!
price:
5-starsi purchased the letscom because i wanted a solid pair of wireless headphones under $50 with good reviews (4.0+) and the letscom's fit those requirements.
"price to value including presentation, build, sound, and usability is 5-stars."
presentation:
5-starsthe
letscom headphones arrived in a good looking matte black case.
i like matte black
so it was perfect for me.
"the case is well built, sturdy enough and will protect the headphones from most situations save crushing them with a tire etc."
build:
5-starsthe letscoms are well built by any standard and best in its price class (>$25).
"i have the matte black version and it's built with high-quality plastic will endure the harsh conditions of various workout regimes: weight-training, running, cross-fit, etc."
the ear hooks are well made and will fit around your ears
well even if your glasses (like i do).sound:
"4.5-starsthe letscom's have a full range sound that i like and on par with other headphones in its class tao, phaiser, plantronics backbeat etc."
"shortly after purchasing the letscom's, purchased beats powerbeats pro as i was planning on using the letscom's as a backup pair of workout headphones."
"while the powerbeats were beautiful, yes apple beautiful, i couldn't quite get the fitment right due to the thickness of my glass's arms."
the fitment affected the way the powerbeats fit within the ear which affected the sound quality.
i did try the powerbeats without my glasses and it seemed the sound level and quality wasn't as dynamic as the letscom's - strange right?you would think a $240 headphones (powerbeats) would surpass a $20 (letscom) in every category
and i can tell you it should
but it didn't
so the price isn't always a factor.
sometimes you have to get the products in your hands to do some hands-on testing.
i sent the powerbeats back.
usability-
pairing:  pairing the letscom's are a breeze and what you would expect - hold a button on the headphones while opening the bt in your phone and selecting the letscom when it appears on the bt screen.- fitment:  
"wearing the letsom is easy, it's keeping them on that's harder."
while the letscom's are easy to wear unlike the bose (see below)
the ear hooks
"while pliable are too pliable, the ear hooks loosen during your activity requiring an adjustment."
"whereas the powerbeats ear hooks were rigid but too big causing a fitment issue, so there's a fine line between rigid and pliable - further testing is needed to ensure the ear hooks are rigid enough to stay in play but pliable enough to fit over glasses etc."
"overall: 4-starsif you're looking for an excellent pair of wireless headphones (the best in their category in my opinion) for a workout, leisure listening, yard work or whatever - look no further."
i don't think you'll be disappointed there a solid 4-star product.
i am giving 4-stars because while the ear hooks fit with my glasses (oakleys) there not rigid enough to keep the securely in my ears without adjustment.
it's not a deal-breaker but annoying enough to demerit 1-star.
i purchased these to use while gardening.
they connect via bluetooth with no problems and answering phone calls thus far is great and everyone i've spoken with so far says they can't tell i'm on headphones (earbuds).
"the sound is great both for phone calls and music, no complaints there at all."
i cannot comment on the battery life yet because i haven't used them more than appx 5 hrs at one time and the battery was working fine at that point.
overall i'm glad i got these rather than paying a bunch of money for another more 'famous' brand.
these sound great.
i mostly use them while working out and gardening and yardwork.
"on the whole, i really like these headphones—they fit well, come with a wide variety of earbud sizes, and have surprisingly decent sound for the size and price."
my one nitpick—
"when the battery hits 30%, it begins to tell you that “battery is low,” and then repeats it over and over until they finally die, meaning that your remaining listening experience is now completely ruined until you can recharge them."
"i don’t mind a heads up, but how about when there’s"
only maybe a minute or two of juice left?
why not let us actually enjoyably use more of the full capacity of the charge?
pros:
"easy pairing, terrific sound, nice features (audio incoming call notification,"
"also for low battery alert,"
quick charging.)cons:
"the ear hooks will probably work good for people with larger ears, but they are poor for people with smaller ears"
", the actual ear tips are terrible at staying in place"
"while exercising (my biggest complaint.), at best, average battery life."
"overall, solid product, will recommend, especially for the price!"
"also, the customer service was responsive & quick"
"in following-up with my inquiries, which is always nice."
i ordered these back in march and the left earbud was broken on arrival.
"at that time, there wasn't an option to return for a replacement or"
the option was hidden/buried.
"so, i went back to using my other headphones that were supposed to be ""retired"".  "
"long story short, i should have addressed this before, but now that my old headphones have finally died, i'm reminded of these headphones don't/never work right."
my review is not only for the quality of the product but also the fact that returning them is seemingly impossible.
"for the price of the product, i don't expect the world, but i do expect it to at least work."
thanks!
they work exactly like they are supposed to.
how refreshing to not have to fight with a new product to get it operational.
"the instructions could have been a little clearer, and printed in a larger, easier to read font."
the bluetooth range is good.
they pair easily with my devices.
"the somewhat obscure led is used intelligently to signal power status, upaired, or paired."
the button works crisply.
i gave only 4 stars for wicking and noise cancelation because i have no way of measuring these.
i liked these so much i bought a second set which i sent to my brother as an early christmas present!
"it took my phone more than a minute to find the earphones on bluetooth the first time, but afterwards the pairing is really fast."
sound quality is decent with enough noise cancelling effect.
ear hooks work great to both keep the earbuds in place and to make long-term wearing comfortable.
multifunction button (mfb) works as expected- one caveat though:
mfb is only on right earbud not left- left
one is simply a decoration.
lastly the accessories are thoughtful-
"i really like the storage case; there are also a charging cable, different sizes of earbud covers, and an organizer"

these headphones are amazing and look amazing however the battery notification on the phone is wrong.
whenever it gets around 50% it starts to say my battery is dying and then dies 5 minutes later.
"i don't like that, but other than that you can't go wrong with these headphones."
just make sure to always charge it and keep an eye on the battery so it doesn't fool you.
letscom wireless earbuds were my second pair of wireless bluetooth headphones after a long hiatus.
"after my first pair, i was not motivated to try another pair, but after using and ruining so many corded pairs, i decided to try out a wireless pair and the u81's have been great!  "
"i used to pay $15-$20 for a wired set with a headphone, so the cordless aspect was a huge bonus for such a similar price.  "
the design fits my ears well and they are plenty loud enough to drown out noise.
"they come with other bud sizes for different ears, a charging cable, and a case."
the charger is a standard micro usb.
"price, sound quality and overall reliability are my favorite parts."
some aspects i wish were better are signal strength and battery indicators.
my phone's audio can start breaking up at points when my phone is in my pocket.
"also, if the device is not at full battery, it will disconnect when trying to call someone."
"if i accept a call, the headset will power off and transfer the call back to my phone."
its not really clear what battery level is needed to have the ability to call using the headset.
the battery indicator on my phone also shows the battery life incorrectly.
"full charge is 100%, however it typically dies after 6.5 hours of consistent usage, with my phone reporting 70% battery shortly before it dies."
"(this could be my phone incorrectly reading, or the headsets incorrectly reporting."
i am unsure.
"overall, i am able to happily overlook the small quirks of these headphones for the great price."
i even bought a second pair when i damaged my first (my fault).
i like these.  
"they look good, and seem to work great.  "
i've had them for a while now.  
"the battery has never died on me, i bring them everywhere"
"and i have no issues with them, other than the fact that they pick up background noise a lot.  "
"my friend has the same pair, and he will call me, and i'm asking why he's got the radio blasting, and he tells me it's elevator music that he can barely hear on his end.  "
"the same thing happens where other people tell me that on their end, when i'm using them.  "
"it's a small issue, and the only reason i'm giving 4 stars instead of 5."
"this is a very simple, neat, tough product which does all that it claims it can do and is an excellent product at below 20 dollars."
"the battery easily works for 8 hours (i think maybe even a bit longer at lower volumes), the sound quality is quite good for most normal uses, the bluetooth range and connectivity has no issues and even the microphone during phone calls works perfectly without any troubles."
great product which i have really enjoyed using.
would strongly recommend.
you can't ask more for something at this price.
i bought these headphones for my boyfriend because he was in dire need of new headphones for his job
(he works on an extremely noisy warehouse).
"he loves listening to music and podcasts at work, but the noise is often too loud and incompatible with previous headphones he purchased in the past that were labeled ""noise cancelling""."
"when he got these, he tested them out right away and was literally overjoyed with the quality."
he doesn't have to worry about the headphone cords getting in his way while he's working.
he just clips him onto his ears and is ready to go.
"he can take calls without using his hands which is something he really likes as he is using his hands non-stop, he says that the noise cancellation is exquisite."
"i tried these out myself and i have to say that these are probably the best headphones i've ever heard out of. ,besides the noise cancellation and hands-free bluetooth connection, he is extremely happy about the fact that he's able to hear sounds in his favorite song"
but he's never heard.
will definitely recommend to many others and i have a pair of the same ones and blue in my shopping cart on amazon
love these earbuds!
i used the powerbeats3 for years and i always had to replace them after 6 months.
the one thing i hated about the powerbeats is that the grip around my ears would always break off eventually.
just recently i had a pair for 5 months and they started disconnecting/turning off every 20 minutes.
it was so frustrating considering how expensive they were!
"these letscom earbuds not only sound awesome, but have a softer grip around my ears which makes it harder to bend & break!"
they look awesome (i got the black/gray) and they came 100% charged!
i have an android
so i now get to see the battery percentage unlike the beats.
i highly recommend them!!
(i haven't tested the moisture yet
but i will!
i'm not sure how long itll take me to charge them fully
but if they dont charge as quickly as the powerbeats did then i will deal with it because they are so much better.
plus they reach all the way from my upstairs office to my kitchen downstairs without disconnecting!
i ordered these when my last headphones (different brand) died on me in the middle of a workout.  
i absolutely love them!  
i have an issue with buds always falling out but these stay in no matter how hard i work.  
they are definitely noise canceling.  
i no longer can hear the annoying conversation between the two guys that love to non stop talk to each other about their muscles that always seem to post up right next to me in the gym.  
these headphones are a god sent!  
plus the quality of the sound coming through is perfect.  
i would definitely recommend these headphones.
i was a bit skeptical of the product before buying it because of the relatively lower price.
"months later, they still hold up very well!"
they are great for a college student who doesn't want to walk a mile across campus without an audiobook or music playing.
my previous challenge was that i like wearing dresses and gym shorts--which often do not have pockets to accommodate my phone--and i don't like having to hold my phone all the time.
i was also tired of having to be careful with wires and tangles.
"these headphones gave me the option of setting my audio, tossing my phone in my bag, and rushing off to the next class hands free."
i also don't have to worry about them falling out as i'm walking which is nice.
"i have small ear canals, so i always have to go to the smallest earbud available, and even that isn't satisfactory sometimes."
"not only do the smallest options with these earphones fit, but the ear hook makes the earphones falling away from my ears impossible."
"i wear glasses, so i was worried initially about discomfort when the glasses and the ear hook overlap, but the hook is soft and flexible enough while also maintaining its purpose that i don't feel discomfort when using them."
at first i was worried about battery power.
i commute and don't want to sacrifice listening time to charge the earphones when i'm out and about.
the battery power is more than enough to last me the entire day from sunrise to past sunset.
"i can't speak to the audio quality in detail as a not-audiophile, but as the average modern, tech-savvy young person with reasonable standards, i find the audio quality satisfactory to my needs."
"as for the noise cancelling, i haven't tried to activate the full ear seal since earphones like these create a suction that hurts my ears."
that is a personal thing though
so i'm not sure how it affects others' comfort.
tldr;
great earphones for a great price!
bough a second pair for my mom because of how much i enjoy these!
"these are a great sounding, comfortable, form-fitting, and stable workout headphones!"
"i bought these specifically because i was running a 10k race and needed something that would sound good, be comfortable, and wouldn't fall out during the race."
i'm very pleased to say these not only met my expectations but surpassed them.
they arrive in a small case with extra rubber earpieces.
i wasn't expecting all the extra ear pieces
but i was super pleased because the pair that was on the headset were a little big.
after experimenting with the different options i found the perfect size.
after charging them i took them to the gym and used my garmin music watch and paired them.
it worked perfect with my watch and my google pixel 3 android phone.  
the workout was great and i barely even noticed that i was wearing them.
race day went perfectly.
what i also wasn't expecting is how good the noise cancelling was.
during my race i was surround by a few hundred runners.
with a bit of volume i didn't hear anyone around me and could concentrate on the music  and my running.
"i highly recommend these for runners, anyone into working out, or anyone just looking for a good set of bluetooth headphones."
"i ordered 2 of these june7,2019 for 2 seperate"
"pplwell its been 2 months and my dads stopped charging, not only that-"
the cord that came with it burned out his perfectly good car charger.
so im guessing the headphones got burned out tooinitially
he told me he didnt like that it comes without a wall pug just usb and
him being 60
i said its cool dad just use any i
m
sure the company is sure enough itll be fine since they didnt send one .. and he wasnt happy because i always press him about shitty wall plugs amd chargers .  
then poom sure enough they crap out on him ..
he wasnt pleased
and i hate when my dad gets upset over electronics--he has such bad luck it beyond me.
im going to make a claim with amazon or the company idk
do not buy...
i fully charged the headphones the day i received them and then went to connect them to my phone prior to heading to the gym.
turned product on and it kept cutting off as if it never charged.
it was flashing the red light as showing the phone wasn’t charged.
when it was flashing to connect to a bluetooth it also would not connect to my iphone.
headphones do not work!!!!
i’m huge on reviews
so i purchased based off of reviews
but i’m returning because these headphones are trash...
overall great headphones for the price.
battery lasts a pretty good bit.
the sound is great especially for the amount of money paid.
you can definitely hear the bass.
the noise cancelling is awesome.
on the plane i wear these without any music and it cuts down on the noise very well.
the only con i have is the wife hates talking to me on the phone through these as they pic up every sound and amplifies it to the max on the other side.
i can hear her very well.

great earbuds for the active lifestyle.
"waterproof, great looking design and appearance, and stay put when active."
"no worries about losing one of them while out mountain biking, and i’m able to answer phone calls while on the go without having to take my phone out of my pocket."
"for our and about activities, i prefer these over the individual earbuds because i don’t have to worry about losing one while i’m being crazy on the side of the mountain."
i've had these headphones for over 2 months now.
"for the most part, i use them to listen to music or podcasts while i'm running or working out."
sound qualityin terms of sound
", the quality is great."
the headphones are nicely balanced to where i can hear lyrics clearly while still enjoying some thumpin' bass.
"i generally listen to music on the lowest setting with these and, even then, the sound is loud enough to cancel out other noise."
"this aspect is a double-edged sword for me; on some occasions, drowning out other noise is preferred."
"however, for the most part, i don't like to blast my music all the time."
"if letscom could lower their lowest volume settings to increase the range of sound you can listen to, i'd likely wear them more than i do."
comfortthe headphones are comfortable to wear for ~2hrs or so.
"after that, the back of my ears get slightly irritated from the friction of the wrap-around portion of the headphones."
"the headphones come with different earbud sizes--for me, the standard ones that were already on fit me just fine."
"i haven't had an issue yet with sweat affecting the wear or fit, but that may change as i continue to use them."
"microphonethe microphone on the headphones is great, and the bluetooth connection is solid."
the connection is generally good for 20-25 ft before you start to lose some connection
"(this is without any physical obstructions to the connection).overall, these are a solid set of headphones and i would recommend them for those who want some affordable, sporty earbuds."
we have bought several different brands of earbuds over the years.
"my husband is a welder at a machine shop so finding something that last all day, has good sound quailty and noise cancellation for under $50 has been hard."
"these are, by far, my husband's favorite pair yet."
he has had them since january and they are still going strong and the battery still lasts all day.
several people he works with have noticed them and purchased a pair for themselves.
we highly recommend them!!
what's not to love about this?
"for just $20, you get a great quality headphones."
i have spent $150+ on similar products and just feels like a sucker in retrospect.  
i probably don't have to mention that brand but the letscom wireless sports headphones beats the more expensive ones.
it is easy to connect to your mobile device.
the controls are easy to remember.
the sound quality is impeccable.  
the fit takes a little trial and error
"but when you find the right earbuds, it becomes noise-cancelling to a certain point.  "
this product is a gem.
"recieved package september 3, 2019.i was loving my new letscom bluetooth headphones"
", the shipping was fast, the music quality was excellent especially for the price!"
than one day i left them on overnight until completely dead.
"no problem, the only thing i have to do is recharge them..."
right?
wrong!
the headset didn't recharge!!!
can you believe it?
"i really hate the fact they just ""stopped"" working for simply being left on all night."
"so, this is the reason for my 1-star--"
"otherwise, i would have given this product a much higher rating!"
"i'll come back for an update as i try to reach out to manufacture, hoping they can bring a quick resolution to my apparent frustration!!!****11-22-19 update"
: a company's success depends on having great customer service!i am truly a satisfied customer with customer service of the company letscom!
"a very nice gentleman by the name of robert read my review and saw how i was so disappointed with this product, which i loved until it finally stopped working!"
"thus, on behalf of letscom, robert immediately went into resolution mode and opted to send a replacement or refund my money!"
"now that's the type of immediate action a ""disgruntled"" customer can appreciate!therefore, due to how the team at letscom (upon learning about my grievance) expeditiously resolved this matter with absolutely no hassle--"
i had no problem submitting this update and changing my 1-star rating to 5-stars!
the product was a 5-star and a very excellent product prior to it going out on me.
"so, i thought it is only right to reestablish it well-deserved rating!!!thanks again robert & the entire letscom team for great customer service!"
i bought these to work out with
so i took them to the gym and did my usual work out.
i'm the lazy dude at the gym who sweats but isn't drenched head-to-toe from some military style routine.
"nevertheless, these earbuds must have gotten a little wet and stopped working in the right earpiece."
i used them once and they were ruined from a simple work out.
i have purchased cheap headphones on amazon before and they worked much longer than these - at least two months.
i think i've learned that spending a bit more on headphones is a good idea.
"these have better bass than other earbuds, but the trade-off seems to be that the highs are a bit muddled, almost as if a rubber cover had been put over the speaker."
"not sure why the description lists noise cancellation, as there is no active noise cancelling within the product."
"the default review asks for rating on ""moisture wicking"" as well, but as far as i can tell, there is no fabric that would do this."
"i haven't tested the ipx7 rating, but the earbuds seem to hold up fine to sweat during a workout."
these are a good quality headphones that do just as the description states.
they're comfortable on the head and although my ears did feel a little warm with them on it was only because i was wearing them nonstop for about 2 hours.
the switch on it is really easy to use.
turn it to right
", power on and you can start to use."
the first time when i use it i have to link it with the bluetooth.
"but after you only need to simply turn on the switch, it will link up automatically."
they are a battery indicate picture on the phone to show you how much baterry left to use.
and the battery life is superb.
you charge it once it last for days.
recommended to buy.
"as an avid hiker and jogger, i recently purchased these lightweight sports earbuds to use during hikes or jogging, and after two weeks of use the battery still has not needed to be recharged!"
"i am very impressed with the earbuds, and for the price they have decent sound quality."
"they seem durable enough to last maybe 1-3 years, we shall see how the battery lasts!i'll update my review if i encounter any issues."
"four stars because they have absolutely no bass whatsoever, and"
"i have older earbuds that had a little bit better sound quality, but otherwise fantastic earbuds!"
summary:
these can't be beat for the price.
"i used to be a nonbeliever in bluetooth earphones either because of battery life, sound quality, or fit."
this product eased all those concerns for me.
pros:-great range:
i can be over 50 feet away from my phone before they start to cut out.-solid battery life: i'd estimate it at about 10 hours of listening.-quick charge: i can connect them to my 2.1a phone charger (most high speed phone chargers operate at this amperage or higher) and i can get 5+ hours of use in about 30 minutes of charge time.-waterproof
", corrosion-resistant design: the usb port cover has a tight seal that helps keep out moisture; i sweat a lot in the gym"
"and i haven't noticed any damage over two months of hard, consistent use.-convenient compact carrying case:"
"the earbuds zip up neatly with no hassle.-quick, easy pairing: never had an issue with my phone (samsung galaxy s7) forgetting the device or generating any error messages"
when connecting.-sound quality:
"for headphones this cheap (and especially over bluetooth), they preserve the frequency range remarkably well."
"they seem to overcompensate on the bass just a bit, but not enough for it to be too bothersome."
"they're $20 or less, so don't expect audiophile quality, but they're as good or better than any other $20 set of wired headphones that i've used in the past.-fit"
": they come with three different sized ear tips, and the behind-the-ear hooks are soft enough that they can accommodate a range of ear sizes without digging in or being too loose."
"cons:-battery meter: depending on the device you're connecting these earphones to, they might they might surprise you with a sudden low battery signal, after which they'll only last for another 20-30 minutes."
"my phone will sometimes indicate the headset is at 70% battery when i first connect it, and then i'll hear the low battery indicator within a few minutes."
"this usually only happens if i haven't charged them after close to 10 hours of use, so"
"that's equally on me, i guess..."
just remember to charge them every 8-10 hours of use and you'll be fine.-volume button layout:
"it was a bit counterintuitive to press the button farther back to increase the volume, but i got used to it after a while."
"i purchased these headphones after buying a pair before that i wasn't happy with, in the same price range."
i was quite pleasantly surprised when i purchased these.
"i have some weird shaped ears, and although the headphones did have some extra silicon pieces to help get a good fit, none really fit my ears."
"again, not the fault of the manufacturer."
"the bass driver is quite good, and you get some good thumping going depending on what you are listening to."
"i use these headphones to work out, and they are most definitely sweatproof."
i have been using them 3-5 days a week easily during workouts and not a problem whatsoever.
"speaking of those 3-5 days a week, i use the headphones for an hour and a half to two hours a day, and only have had to charge them maybe once a week, so the battery life is actually quite excellent."
"if you are looking for a good pair of headphones that won't break the bank, look no further."
these headphones are priced excellently and come in all variety of colors to help coordinate with what you wear while using them.
amazing for the price!
"when we first purchased these letscom headphones it was simply supposed to be for headphones for listening while on the go, upon getting the product we first noticed the boxing and packaging was super professional with a case for storing them and a quality charger.  "
"certainly, way more than we expected for the price."
hooking these up was a breeze to bluetooth
"and it was immediately recognized, but"
what blew me away being a sound engineer and producer in a studio was the sound quality for the price and the great frequency response.
it covers everything from low bass to crisp high treble which is great.
what's best is mobility.
the battery last and
"you can move with these so much that when i'm going over songs at the beginning of sessions, i find myself reaching for these to start off."
again i'm an audio engineer
"so i'm hard to please,"
these past
"my testmichael ""major keyz"" walker"
this is not an airpod which costs north of $200.00.  
this was a replacement for a iphone usage.  
my daughter's headphones broke and we bought it for her.  
"the calling was crystal clear and she could hear us over everything, the only reason i gave 4 starts for the noise cancellation part was because it was picking up ambient noises from the back-ground where she was.  "
"for a 20$ headset, it is unbeatable."
"these headphones are fine for the gym, with decent sound quality."
"like other comments/raters making phone calls was problematic as i was frequent told that i was difficult to hear or that it sounded like i was ""talking in a can."""
decent battery life as well.
"my biggest issue is (in my experience), these headphones are terrible for running because they fall out of your ears!"
i am a runner
"so this is a hugeeee issue for me, as the primary reason i purchased these headphones was for running."
"i have normal shaped ears, the ear buds just do not mold/fit in ears."
"i've tried literally everything to try to have the headphones stay in and on my ears, nothing has been successful."
the over ear-portion of the headphones does not adjust-and unless you have larger ears-there is no way they will fit.
i've grown to be so frustrated while running and
the constant (literally every 5 seconds) readjustments and pushing the headpiece in my ear that i am purchasing new headphones because currently my runs end in me having to complete my runs with my headphones shoved in my sports bra.
moral of the story - fine for gym
but if you are a runner beware!
and purchase other headphones :)
just got these headphones at a great price.
"have had some in past, these are very good quality so far."
"i have used then a few days so far and they sound great, seem to do ok despite the moisture from perspiration, and i am a very big sweater unfortunately, and the bluetooth distance seems to hold up well cuz"
i keep them in ears with my phone in my gym bag
and they sound great as i walk all over the gym.
"so far work great, look nice , and can’t beat the price!"
i purchased these headphones because i was tired of using wired headphones while mowing the yard or exercising.
i always found the cord just too short or that it would tangle up as i moved my head.
there is nothing worse than having your noise canceling headphones yank out of your ear while in the middle of mowing or trimming your yard.
"i found with old headsets, this would happen all the time; sometimes necessitating me shutting down whatever equipment i was using, pulling off my gloves, and reseating the headphones, hoping it would not happen again."
these headphones were exactly what i was looking for.
they fit well in my ear and cancel the noise pretty effectively.
effectively enough that i can hear my podcasts over the lawnmower without cranking the volume up to uncomfortable levels.
the sound quality is acceptable and pretty good for headphones in this price range.
they were easy to charge up and sync to my phone.
i had no issues there.
i have been using them for about a month mowing once a week in the florida summer and they are showing no signs of quitting on me so far.
for this price if they last me a couple mowing seasons i will be satisfied.
"the carrying case is not something i would use, but it holds everything well and would be easy to put the headphones and all the charging equipment in just a couple seconds."
overall i would recommend these to anyone looking for a solid set of bluetooth headphones that will cancel out the background noise.
my only real complaint about this product is the time it takes to pause.  
just a gentle brush or tap of the master control button right on the side of the right earpiece sends it into pause mode.  
given how easy it is to tap that button just re-seating the headset in your ear makes this inconvenient.  
"i wish it was a full second, or that the headset came back from pause a little more quickly."
"other than that, a great find, great sports earpiece and excellent value."

these buds are really great sound.
i wear them 6-7 times per week for workouts.
i work up a great sweat during my cardio sessions.
the buds are great until
the sweat is pouring down the sides of my face.
"then, the buds slip out of my ears every minute- which is annoying."
"however, the buds have not shorted out at all"
( every other pair of buds i've owed have had one ear short out after a sweaty session)i
pull my sweatband over the buds over my ears to hold them in an
we're golden.
sound quality:
initially while ordering i did expect an average or above average sound quality.
but i got surprised after started using it
and i continuously used for more than 10 hours.
"because of sound quality and noise cancellation, able to spend a lot of time enjoying music."
paring:
pairing is as easy as you switch on the light.
"once i connected to my mobile, whenever earbuds took out from power box"
it's automatically getting connected within no time.
charging:
wireless charging is one great thing and charging backup box is an addition to that.
this is helping while going on a log hours journey.
"overall, it's too good for the price of its offering."
"i’ve had these headphones for about a week now, and i’m very pleased with them so far."
"the sound quality, material, battery life, and comfort/fit are all consistent with many of the other reviews."
"there are two pieces of information i would like to add that do not affect my opinion of the headphones, but might be useful to consider."
"i have found them to be quite loud, and having my phone set to the lowest possible volume makes the headphones just quiet enough for listening in environments without much background noise."
"additionally, there is a front facing light on the right earpiece that flashes intermittently when the headphones are on, which is sometimes noticeable when watching a screen, or when in a darker room."
"overall, the headphones are very satisfactory, especially considering the price."
this is my second pair of headphones in this style.
the first set the battery died after about 30 days and wouldn't recharge.
"amazon was great to work with and they provided me a credit, not the company."
with the credit i tried them again since i don't want to spend a lot of money for headphones to work out in.
the second set i have not had a problem with and they work great through workouts.
"the sound quality isn't the best, but for me, i am more focused on the workout so that doesn't matter to me as much, but to others, it might be the breaking point."
if you are looking for an inexpensive headphone that will keep you going this is it.
i typically don't have to charge them every day since the battery lasts through several workouts no problem.
"just know that if you get one of the ""bad"" sets you may have to return them for the battery suddenly stopping to hold a charge."
my husbands xmas gift.
they were supposed to be for the gym
but they disconnected constantly and the sound gets choppy when he runs.
good for kids or at home activities but not for gym use.
update!!!after getting a couple other bluetooth headphones a try
my husband decided these work better than other brands out there and have a better sound.
he returned the other 3 and kept this pair.
thanks for reaching out to me to resolve the issue as well to the seller.
they really work hard for positive reviews and care about their customers feedback!
this is the 3rd set of different bluetooth headphones that i have ordered in the past year.
"i use these daily for everything from working out at the gym to taking conference calls and listening to music at work, and so far they have worked out well."
sound quality is good and no one is complaining about my audio cutting out during a call.
"that said, i have only had these a week and time will tell how they stand up in the long run."
based on my experience a headset like this will generally last me anywhere between 6 months and a year based on my somewhat heavy usage.
"in the end, my only real complaint(s) are they are not magnetic so the actual earbuds will not stick together when wrapped around your neck (which isn't necessarily a bad thing just a nice feature) and that the design of the ""over ear"" mechanism meant to hold the earbuds is an acquired taste as all my other headsets have had the ""in ear"" design (i.e. the little curled pieces that hold the earbuds in your ear)."
"however, these are more just extra features that i have become accustomed to rather than a knock against the product."
although the controls on the earbuds are simple to use and understand and the battery life seems really good so far...
i got a lot in this package.
"i guess i didn't really read what was included, there are so many choices"
and it's very time consuming.
so i was surprised
be how many things came with these headphones.
"i got an airplane adapter,extra earpieces, and a connector which i use to connect my ipod to an external battery."
"i'm sure it's for something else, but i dont know what."
"also, the earbuds magnetically click together."
this probably is for storage or anti tangling
but i just think it's cool.
"there was also a little silk bag to put the extras in, so i consider this whole set good ""gift quality"" if you're christmas shopping."
it works very well.
"i have brought over-ear noise cancelling,  but always end up with sweat ears."
so trying to get in-ear one.
this is cheap and works.
the sound quality is very clear and clean (does not have a lot of bass)they are comfortable and has support lay rest on inner ears.
the noise cancelling is working great.
i tested it while in my cars on highway.
i think it reduces at leat 50% road noise.
"i do recommend to change to form type ear tips, so it can isolate more noises."
it has talk mode where you press the button
and it's mic
will pickup the conversation and transmit to earbuds.
so don't need to turn off the noise cancelling or take off the earbuds if some one wants to speak with you.
"it last pretty long, 10+ at least."
"also, you still can listen music when noise cancelling is off."
and there is no on sound quality between on and off.
"so, if it is out of battery, you still can use it."
"it also comes with a small storage bag, which is nice to storage it."
"so far i like it, and probably will get another one for my son so he can watch movie on airplane."
i got this noise canceling earphones to help me sleep at night.
i am a light sleeper and the littlest noise will wake me up.
then i have trouble falling back asleep and spend the next day being tired.
"since wearing this headset overnight, my sleep quality has improved."
my husband is a night owl and comes to bed late.
this headphone helps blocks out all the sounds he makes when coming to bed.
it does not block out sound completely but is greatly reduced.
i also don't get woken up by the sound of him snoring.
the ear piece is also very comfortable and sound quality is good.
this is a must have if you are sensitive to noise.
what i did after buying this amazing noise
cancelling earphone was replace the ear tip with a new one.
it's because the basic ear tip didn't fit my ears well.
and this made noise-cancelling performance and sound quality better.
i didn't trust this earphone before purchase because i couldn't find information on the internet.
"but, now, this is totally great."
i didn't expect this good performance at this price.
"i can't compare it to earphones that are much more expensive than this, but i can say that this has better noise cancelling than the cowin e7 headphone i have."
"there are some hiss noise when noise canceling is turned on, but it is small enough to be ignored."
you can hear noise if you use noise cancelling in a quiet place. :)
this.
sounds.
amazing.
"honestly, when purchasing this i was a little skeptical because the price i was paying seemed like i would get something not as good, but once i tried them, i was amazed."
the sound quality is absolutely superb and the noise cancelation is perfect!
i can't hear a thing outside of my music and i absolutely love it for studying when i don't want any distractions.
"i would most certainly reccomend this as the sound quality is amazing, noise cancelation is perfect, and the price is really great for what you're getting."
this headphone is very cheap。 for this price
i think this is very convenient for daily life
。
thsi thing clear noise is good to。
ilike it
。
"this time i got the black version, the outer packaging is relatively simple, or continue the style of this headset, simple and environmentally friendly, not too much fancy."
"when the headset is connected for the first time, it is quite convenient."
"just plug in the phone and click it, you can connect successfully."
"the whole connection process is fast and simple, and you can switch noise reduction at will."
"i love these ear buds, they might even be my new favorite buds."
"the sound quality is great, highs and lows, the only earbuds that have ever given my bose ie2s a challenge."
"i have never used any other noise cancelling headphones before so i can't compare them to another brand, but it does work better"
"then i expected, it reduced talking levels by about half."
"build quality seems very good, and comes with 12 month warranty."
overall i am very happy with theses.
"when looking for budget active noise cancelling headphones, you can't really find anything that rivals the silence produced by bose."
"however these get close, for a tenth of the price!"
"they do produce a slight hiss, but it's not noticeable when you're actually listening to something."
"they work well enough for most people, and with a battery life of 15 hours, you can take these on the plane to free yourself of the constant disturbing background noise."
"the hooks work very well in keeping them in your ears, and you can choose from three different sizes of hook and bud."
"as for sound quality, these obviously can't rival more expensive sets for shear clarity, but they're not so bad that you'll actually notice it."
"for casual listening when on the go, these are my pick every time."
"lightweight, comfortable, and anc that you can actually appreciate."
i was shocked at how good these headphones sounded for the price.
huge jump in quality from what i usually use!super comfortable in the ears and the noise cancelation seemed to work good.
also i was very pleased to find out they worked even without using the noise cancelation!carrying case
was a nice bonus too
i am very happy with this earbuds
they are very comfortable to wear
they don't hurt my ears.  
i use them mostly when i excercise so its important for the earbuds to fit snug without discomfort.  
these earbuds product a very clear souds without any distortion.  
they are very reasonable priced for the quality.
i work in a warehouse and there are a lot of moving noise.
this help block out some of the noise.
i don't have to completely block out all the noises because i still need to be aware of what is happening around me due to dangerous scenario inside the warehouse.
for me it is does a good job if you are looking to cancel out some of the noise but
not completely the the more expensive anc headphone
sometimes  you need to be wired in.
i own a couple of pairs of bluetooth earbuds and they are great unless they are falling out all the time or don't have enough volume.
so i picked these up because they have good high volume quality sound
and they fit perfectly in the ears.
"i didnt have high hopes for these earphones, they were relitively cheap in comparison to other noise cancelling earphones i was looking at so didn't expect much."
i'm glad i was so wrong!!
i use them to listen to my audio books whilst working the night shift at a busy manufacturing firm and they work a treat!
"i would highly recommend if you are looking for budget, but still good, noise cancelling earphones"
my kids need good noise cancelation earphones phones for their music practice.
"so far they had bought very expensive ones, but we are lucky to have found this bowink noise cancelation earphones.  "
in the video you see the rectangle piece/noise control switch close to the cellphone.
"with just a click of the switch you block the noise, or you allow yourself to hear everything."
they are the perfect noise control earplugs at a very convenient price.
i do recommend these earphones.
honestly.
this is the best earbuds i've ever purchased.
i ordered them for my samsung galaxy 8 and honestly it works better than originals...
sound is very clear with good bass.
good quality.
"comes with the cases, extra earbuds cover and bag."
oh and also with cable and adapter.
the earphones have good sound quality.
they noise canceling works good too but only to a certain extent.
this is good for a noisy commute on public transportation or studying in a cafe.
"the earphones are one of the cheapest ive seen with noise cancelling, so i had to give it a try."
did not disappoint!
great sounds.
sleek design.
"in the package: headphones, adapter for the two socket plug, bag for all accessories, usb charger, instruction and additional silicone covers."
the headphones cord is fabric which is nice.  
will need an adapter for a newer iphone plugins.
can’t believe this earbuds can cancel the noise very well!
very comfortable!
it has great sound quality with powerful base.
i like to enjoy listening to my music while cleaning the house.
i’d like to do more house work with it.
no complaints any more.
these buds are solidly built and they have pretty good bass and good sound.
"i love these headphones for work and listening to songs on my phone, or sometimes audio books."
the build quility is good and i like the color accent on these thing
these are very comfortable and work great.  
i use them for my daughter with autism and they help to eliminate the sounds that over stimulate her.  
i have also used them and they are work great.
"5/5 in sound quality, 5/5 in noise cancellation, and 5/5 in comfort."
"the best part of these imo is the magnetic clamp that sticks the two ear buds together, so it won't get tangled."
these comfortable earbuds came just as promised.
"they look nice, play music nicely and have several functions that make it easy to skip to the next song, turn up and down music and a microphone for when i want to talk on the phone with them in."
sometimes you do need a pair of wired ear earphone with noise cancelling function.
this pair works well and it’s comfortable to wear as well.
hope it can be used for couple of years.
"bought it for my dad, and he loves it."
he said consider the price this earphone is the best in noise canceling.
now he uses this headphone all the time when he works in his garage.
hope this pair of earphone can last long.
these a really nice .. useful for listening to audible books ...driving 8 hours a day i need comfortable
ear buds ...
these are plenty long enough to use while driving !!!
the headphones fit me perfectly.
the product is small and exquisite.
the sound quality is clear and the volume is appropriate.
i'm not worried about them falling out.
i use it every time i go to the gym
these headphones are awesome for travel.
great quality and noise cancelling is super helpful for car trips and airplane trips.
nice
as higher end pairs
i have tried.
"my daughter likes these, the controls to the noise cancelling is kinda big and bulky"
but the quality is decent for the price of the headphones.
i don’t like the extra part on the earbud part
but you can take it off.
"when they first arrived, i was very pleased with the quality of their sounds, the comfort of their ears and their ability to block out external noise."
i use headphones to do my homework or watch movies on the computer.
"i wasn't rude to them at all, i kept them carefully, and they've worked just fine so far."
it's very cool headphones!
big plus is that when listening does not hurt my head.
(i suffer from migraines and for me it is very important).the sound is clear.
the shape of the headphones is very comfortable: they do not fall out of my ears;)
"the bass is very clear, the tunes are bright."
the headphones have convenient song switches and a pause button.
there is also a microphone.
it works well.
thanks!
i am very satisfied!
love them!
i workout and
i like really getting into my workout
so cancelling noise around me helps me focus alot more.
just perfect.

highly recommended!
these are my favorite running headphones by far.
the sound quality is very clear.
the ear pieces provide a very secure fit.
i've been using this product for several days.
it's one of the most affordable plug products ever.
"i used it at work, i use it almost every day, and the noise reduction helps you hear better!"
satisfactory performance at this price.
"did not expect much from this product, all are as seller advertised especially the noise"
cancelling feature works very well.
the music surrounding your ears is quite amazing with this and
the magnetic feature is very easier for me to take along.
i bought these headphones and i think not in vain.
"after a week of active use, i found no flaws."
"the sound is very clear, all the noises are depressed, listen to the music in them is a pleasure."
"the headphones are comfortably fixed in my ears, i do not feel any discomfort in them."
"i am happy with the purchase, plan to buy another pair in stock."

the only controversy is that active noise makes subtle sounds.
but i like them.
they look durable.
i was pleasently surprised by the quality of the headphones.
comes in a great packaging and looks far superior quality for the price.
the sound quality is great compared to my generic ones i had in the past.
the noise cancelling functionality works well.
these are great set of headphones for travelling on the underground.
really pleased with the purchase!
i am surprised at how much i love these headphones!
they don't bother my ears the way others have in the past (not too bulky for in-ear headphones).
and the noise cancellation function is really helpful.
i love that you can push a button to almost mute the sound to hear what's going on around you.
very cool!
i'm always using it when i'm jogging without my wife.
the stereo is the most amazing part that i gotta tell !
the songs are like cushioning my ears and barely heard the surrounding noise in the park!
just like the awesome noice cancelling feature!

"light-weighted, easy to use."

i bought it for the portability and the price was so good
", i bought two."
i usually purchase cheap earphones from big lots and seldom spend more than $10 as i go thru earphones like candy.
thought maybe purchasing a better quality earphone set might be worth trying.
well these are great.
first of all i really appreciate the quality of sound when they are charged and turned on.
the quality is great.
they also work fine without being powered on which is good if i am unable to charge them.
second and even more important is the magnetic earbuds.
left and right attach to each other eliminating the tangled mess i usually encounter.  
i listen to audiobooks while working approximately 5 or more hours a day
so this is priceless to me.
i got a lot in this package.
"i guess i didn't really read what was included, there are so many choices."
so i was surprised
be how many things came with these headphones.
"i got an airplane adapter, extra earpieces, and a connector which i use to connect my ipod to an external battery."
"i'm sure it's for something else, but i don't know what."
"also, the earbuds magnetically click together."
this probably is for storage or anti tangling
but i just think it's cool.
"there was also a little silk bag to put the extras in, so i consider this whole set good ""gift quality"" if you're christmas shopping."
this.
sounds.
amazing.
"honestly, when purchasing this i was a little skeptical because the price i was paying seemed like i would get something not as good, but once i tried them, i was amazed."
the sound quality is absolutely superb and the noise cancelation is perfect!
i can't hear a thing outside of my music and i absolutely love it for studying when i don't want any distractions.
"i would most certainly recommend this as the sound quality is amazing, noise cancelation is perfect, and the price is really great for what you're getting."
i am surprised with how good the sound of this pair of mini headphone produced.
"the music is very pure and it did blocked the outside sound very well, especially i have some noisy colleagues who talked very loud, although i can still hear them (like shouting), but i can enjoy my music now with this headphone blocking most of the noise."
"also, the line and earpiece feel very high quality, and i am very satisfied with this purchased."
i ordered this headphones for my mom to wear while she is mowing.  
my parents have 10 acres and they mow about 4 acres.  
she spends a lot of time in the spring and summer on her mower
so i thought these would be a great gift for her.  
i love that they are noise cancelling especially since she will have a lot of background noise with the mower.  
"since they were for my mom, i tried them on and they were super comfortable."
"sound quality is very good headphones, bass is very strong, high transparent, fully worth the price, connected to the phone can play, has been testing bluetooth connected phone after listening to music and playing games, very good, very satisfied with this special fashion style, the design of the headset is very good, this is undoubtedly a great price."
"sports wear, especially convenient."
"the acoustics are good, too."
the sound quality is excellent in this earbuds.
with the use of rubber ear hooks they comfortably stay in ears and don't fall off.
they reduce the outside noise at a great level and i wasn't able to hear the other people talking near me.
i liked the braided wire and it seems that the wire isn't going to break in near future.
definitely worth the price!
"i work online from home, while my children are home, so comfortable, noise cancelling headphones with a microphone are very important."
these are perfect!

rubber parts are included to fit any sized ear.  
the active noise cancellation is charged via a supplied usb cord.  
i used them on an airplane recently and could not hear the jet engines.

i kept loos them.
so i decided to get a cheap one.
i’m surprise it works so well.

if you are looking for affordable and durable earplug suggestions.
i have owned a few of these type of headphones and these are my favorites.
"the controls are by far the most logical,"
it’s a great quality sound
"these earbuds provide excellent, clear sound with reasonably good noise cancellation"
noise reduction is definitely a joke.
"noise reduction does not work properly, with louder and louder sounds."
i fully charged it
", it didn't help, and it didn't eliminate noise."
i got a lot in this package.
"i guess i didn't really read what was included, there are so many choices"
and it's very time consuming.
so i was surprised
be how many things came with these headphones.

"there was also a little silk bag to put the extras in, so i consider this whole set good ""gift quality"" if you're christmas shopping."
"these were small, but versatile and they provided my kids with tons of fun over easter!  "
i've purchased sticky hand types of toys on amazon that were 1-2 star products.
"i had to return them because they stained walls, were weirdly greasy and didn't stick.  "
this set is just the opposite!  
i love it.  
you get 80
(i counted and the shipment was accurate...
no missing toys here!)
different sticky toys that vary-  
"sticky hands, geckos, little barbed morning-stars, monkeys, and climbing men.  "
the climbing men were fun-
you just throw them on glass and watch them slowly make their way down.  
the monkeys were usually stretched and launched.  
"the sticky hands and geckos make cute little ""grabbers"" that my kids would use as extensions of their arms.  "
the morning-stars were their weapons of choice in a sticky toy war lol.  
"both boys and girls had tons of fun and these were a huge hit at our easter egg hunt, as well as easter basket and goody bag fillers.  "
i'll definitely be buying it again next year.
super fun party favorwe bought this for my son's coming birthday party next week and the trick or treat event this weekend.
i'm sure this will be a hit!
they come in a huge pack.
the numbers are correct to the description.
"there're five kinds of sticky toys in red, green, blue and yellow colors."
the sizes are larger than the dollar store ones.
very satisfied.
"good price, we used for carnival prizes at a birthday."
package came quick.
some pieces were very thin and they broke after a little playtime
but we're good enough for the party and prizes.
package did not however come with 80 pieces it was more like 70 but that still fot our needs fine.
just didn't receive the exact number of items product description had listed.  
you get what you pay for
but they were a hit at the party.
the kids love them!
great price...
"one of their favorite toys, yet one of the cheaper ones..."
a win for me!
"they seem to be holding up well, better than i thought... very sticky, which the kids love, but getting them of the ceiling is getting old!"
lol...
highly recommend!
a great value!
we used this for my daughter's 7th birthday party.
she wanted super hero girls
and i didn't want to pay the high prices for tableware
so we went this this pack and it worked beautifully.
we used the stickers on plain tablecloths to tie them in with the theme.
the cupcake wrappers and toppers were excellent and there were tons left over.
some of the flingers broke but there were so many that it wasn't a problem.
the masks worked with stickers i had but the girls couldn't decorate them with markers due to the glossy surface.
the bracelets were given as a thank you and were well received.
love these masks!!
"made of a thicker, good quality felt and my son’s love them."
"there are some masks that i’m not sure what superhero they belong to, but it’s not a biggie, my son’s don’t know the difference."
"we’ll be using them for a birthday party, can’t"
wait!*update*
everyone at the party loved them and asked where i got them.
the kids had a blast picking out their mask and wearing them.
"it was the perfect party favor, and again, the quality was decent and definitely worth the price."
"great product!gerbs gourmet raw hemp seed kernels is an excellent topper on yogurt, in salads instead of croutons, in protein drinks, etc ..."
endless opportunities with these little yummy kernels.
😃
they are like chomping on sunflower seeds only healthier for you
(there's no salt) and they are way easier to digest.
my order arrived quickly and perfectly.
gerbs is a great company to support to keep small business afloat and to enjoy our healthy lifestyles.
keep enjoying yummy gerbs raw hemp seed kernels.
😊
hempseed kernals are increasingly a part of healthy diets.
i eat them almost daily.
this supplier has consistently produced a high-quality product at the lowest price i have encountered.
i especially appreciate the packaging in 4 lb.
bags at considerably lower cost per oz.
and prime shipping.
other suppliers are requiring a week or more for shipping.
this timely shipping was very important.
these are ok for fun.
pretty good price.
"however, i ordered this pack because it shows a my little pony and tmnt mask in the picture."
we didn't receive those and we got some duplicates.
"also, the logos were sloppily put on with hot glue that was stuck all over the masks."
very well made.
bought these to for my kindergartener son to give out for valentine’s day.
his class has 30 kids so it worked out perfectly.
we didn’t give out the santa or
pumpkin mask
we just kept them.
my son said everyone loved the mask.
he was very happy.

awesome bundle for the price.  
"we needed last minute goodie bags for my son's birthday that he decided was ""the flash"" themed, and co-ed with ages from infant to adult.  "
everyone had fun with the masks and tattoos and flying super heroes.  
"the tattoos are short-lived, but that means we can apply 20 of them without fear of how we'll look at church ina  few days.  "
"the bracelets are true to color, but kid sized wrists only.  "
also - you get many many many tattoos and stickers.  
so much fun.
the first bag of these i got were missing 5.
so i ordered another bag and returned the first.
the second bag was missing some too.
"this was exactly what i was hoping for, good quality and a nice surged edge"
so it doesn't unravel.  
i used it to hang some pictures and they turned out great.  
"(the pictures aren't actually hanging from the burlap ribbon, but they appear to be)"
for how many you get the value is good.
these were party favors and the kids loved them!
they did get a little hot when running around
and we did have a couple break after only once use.
we had these for my sons birthday party for his friends.
they loved them and the quality is amazing.
i was surprised and it was a great time hung to have for the kids to playa nd
have fun at the party
these are great quality and all the kids (ages 18 months to 11 years) loved them at our twins' birthday party.
cheaper than hobby lobby and better quality than i could have whipped up.
we used these for valentines at school.
we received a pretty good mix of each shape.
"for the low price, the quality was decent."
"my kids have played with the ones they kept multiple times and they are still working (except for the man, he broke easily)."
i would purchase again.
"quite yummy, actually."
"it's a little small (individual seeds) to eat as a seed (as opposed to sunflower seeds), but i've been using them in brownies, banana bread, etc., and not only does it add flavor, it also aids pain relief, according to my husband, who had spinal fusion surgery."
"loved these, huge hit at halloween."
super thick hat quality felt and well made.
these things are tough!
"absolutely thrilled with this purchase, couldn't have made them better if i had made them myself."
"elastics sewn on with good thread and triple sewn, toddler friendly"
big hit for the kids for their treat bag after the birthday party just be careful some of them leaves makes on walls.
not the sellers fault but just a warning....
bought for a super girl/super hero birthday party my daughter loved them
amazing quality for the price!
my hopes were not very high because they were so cheap
but i needed a “boy” party favor.
these far exceeded my expectations!!
used this for a rustic woodland theme diaper cake.
it was the perfect size.
it was nice that the lace is already on the burlap and saves an extra step.
these are great.
they seem cheap and flimsy but they work better than more expensive versions we have gotten that stopped sticking after the first day maybe two.
"cheap and fun, all the kids loved the masks!"
this was perfect!
"i feel like party favors are a waste of money for the fact that every time i have purchased thme, i end up finding little toys everywhere after the party is over, and half the kids never take theirs home anyway lol"
"this pack has a great variety, and i'm so glad i found it!"
"we use them as sticker reward chart prizes, and it's perfect."
i'll probably order packs for halloween from now on too.
great value and great product.
"the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that the fabric is somewhat scratchy especially if worn for any extended period of play time."
"otherwise, they seem good quality and the elastic is very sturdy."
they made great favors for our superhero birthday party!
these are pretty awful but what should i have expected for the price.  
not comfortable.
itchy.  
looks nothing like the pictures.  
poor superhero designs.  
can see the glue through felt.  
bad odor upon opening.  
i wouldn't recommend.
i used to play with this type of toy 30+ years ago
the masks are great quality for the price.
bonus that they came with invitation cards and superhero printables!
these are a big hit today at the family reunion!
the kids love them!
they are beautiful.
update:
it’s been 2months since purchase & still going great.
"battery life is around 2days, that’s a good one to me."
will update at 6months how this is holding up.
originalthis wireless earphone right here is the truth!i needed to let go of my bulky headphone hence the need for this.  
i’m impress with the packaging
", well built doesn’t look cheap even for the price then my best about it is the fact that it came with different sizes of ear plugs."
i’ve not been a fan of this type of earphone due to the fact that most earplug are too big for my ears and they fall out
so i decided to try this based on the different sizes of earplug in it
& i'm so glad because this sits comfortably in my ears with no issues.
great noise cancellation effect and the sound quality is good.
battery life is also relatively good
so i’m really gonnna be recommending this to all.
will keep updating how well this earphone is holding  up monthly.
"if this review helped you make a decision or beneficial, don’t forget to mark it as helpful."
thank you.
"great earbuds, i love that they hook over the ear because it gives me more security in knowing they won’t simply fall out of my ear while running or being active."
i like the cable that holds them together for the same reason
", i have more comfort knowing"
i won’t just drop one.
"the sound quality is excellent, and they hold a charge for a good amount of time before needing to be recharged."
"i did find it strange that i ordered the grey ones, but they came in a box picturing a black and red set, but that doesn’t affect the quality of the product either."
just got these today after ordering last night!
love amazon shipping!  
charged the letscom bluetooth headphones up and put them on and threw on some pearl jam..
wow!
the sound was crystal clear!
amazing sound!
super comfortable too.  
very lightweight
and you barely know they're there except for the great sound they're putting out.
they get nice and loud too!
well made slick case is a big bonus.
the title says it.  
"before i say anything else, like any headphones, you have to find the right fit for your ear with these.  "
"i initially was less than impressed, because i couldn't get the sound i expected.  "
"but, after finding the right earpiece size and adjusting the angle of the headphones...boom!  "
really good balanced sound.  
"once adjusted, they will not fall off or out thanks to the hooks.  "
the control buttons are easy to use and responsive.  
battery life...
"i tried to test that...paired them with my laptop at work, playing in the background...."
but after about 12 hours...over a 2 day time period....and they were still going strong....
i threw in the towel.  
will do the 15 hours like they say?  
"probably, but even if they only got 12 consistently..."
i'd be perfectly happy and amazed.
i chose the gray/black color to be different...
and i really like it.  
not the same old black and red like most of the others of this style.  
the included case is also surprisingly nice...very protective and has an inner pouch to store the eartips in.
"as i said, very impressed...especially for the money!"
"this pair of wireless sports headphones is well packaged and in my opinion, well priced."
"comes with a usb cable, and extra cover for ear plug, 1 year extended warranty card."
charge it in for a few hours
and it's ready to go.
"as far as performance goes, 10/10."
best deal so far.
"first, the sound is fantastic."
it's crystal clear from the highs to the lows without any distortion.
"second, it’s well built and are fully noise cancelling."
"third, battery life, 15 hours is letscom’s estimate"
i believe i’ve been getting very close to that as i go on walks and listen to music while studying overall super happy about it!appearance
:honestly it’s look fantastic.
great quality product.
shipping:
i received within 3 days.
customer service:
well responsivei’d recommend these to anyone who is looking to get a good quality wireless sports headphones that is versatile with great sound cancelling and new technology.
"i have wireless bluetooth ear pods, but few times due to sweat those are being dropped while jogging."
so was looking for bluetooth headset which are lightweight and can hold the ears while jogging.
sound quality is great and holding the body while taking jogging laps.
also i charged it on the day i got it and went for jogging for 4 days and its still up and alive.
i am loving this.
thank you to the seller.
"okay, these are awesome."
my boyfriend has profound hearing loss and his hearing aides make it hard to talk on the phone.
he popped these in and was able to hear the music and phone calls clearly (so they get loud).
he was even able to get connection when the phone was inside
and he was on the other side of our acre property.
very nice.
the letscom wireless sports headphones are great quality.  
"they arrive in this very nice, neat box that has the product very well protected.  "
"after charging the headphones, i had the privilege of testing them out.  "
"take it from someone who wears headphones all day for work, they are very comfortable.  "
several times i forgot i had them on.  
they are noise cancelling which works exceptionally well.  
"when using the headphones on a phone call, the other party cannot tell you have headphones on.  "
there is no static.  
listening to the caller is extremely clear as well.  
the headphones are great for just listening to music as well.  
it is like being at the concert in person.  
"you hear all the tones such as the base, string and wind instruments.  "
i would highly recommend these headphones.
i got these headphones to replace a pair that was similar but from a different company.
"these are arguably better than the previous pair, though that is most likely because they are a newer model and haven't been in use for the past three years."
"the sound is nice and crisp, and the base is deliciously deep."
"i was able to use these for a call too, and in that case again the sound was clear and the person on the other end could hear me very clearly."
overall this was a great buy!i will say when i first got these they had some trouble connecting to my phone and the sound wasn't balanced between the two headphones.
at first i thought it was an issue with the hardware
but when i got in touch with the company they gave me a few tips and helped me re-pair my headset to my phone which fixed the issue completely.
letscom customer service was very helpful and please when you do buy these as a gift or for yourself sign up the product for the free one year warranty.
"even if its only for a year, their customer service and help is very useful and you only need the order number from amazon and an account on letscom to sign up."
"if anything changes i will edit the review but so far, i would definitely say that these are worth the buy considering the price point."
i keep buying these buds and giving them to friends and family.
"great battery life,  flawless connectivity,very comfortable.  "
"i tend to lose headphones, but i like these so much that i keep a watchful eye over them."
"far more inexpensive than beats, more durable, better battery, and better sound.  "
boom.
get these!!!
i bought this for my four-year-old
i bought the 12 and a half..
and she wears a size  
12
i just wanted to make sure they weren't going to be too small and
their too big
i should have got the 12
so these are true to size she'll grow into them over the summer time ..
very bright very pretty came with instructions which is a first because i bought these type of shoes before not from this seller but from other places on the web and they have never came with instructions so that was very appreciated
comes with a charging cord but not the charging adapter
you can  use your phone charging adapter to charge them do not use your charging cord for your phone for the shoes use the cord that comes with it ...
they seem to be very well made my daughter loves them highly recommend ...
just a little note if your child walks funny and where's down a portion of the  shoe in one particular spot as my child does you have to watch before it
where's down  and hits the wires .. and repair it
"my daughter loves, loves, loves these shoes!  "
she has worn them everyday since she got them.  
so far we haven't had any issues with them charging but they do seem to need to be off for a while periodically.  
we thought the battery was just dead after 5ish hours but after leaving them off for a while they were able to be turned back on.  
my only complaints are that the tongue doesn't' fit well in the shoe
so it takes some poking and prodding to get it tall tucked in and
"the velcro straps are a bit short, but it doesn't seem to bother my daughter so still 5 stars!"
purchased as an extra for my copper chef casserole pan.
it's construction & materials are
*
far
* superior to the original basket that came with the copper chef pan
and it fits exactly the samr as the original basket.
the only negative thing i would have to say is that it's missing a hook bracket that allows it to catch the side of a pan for draining.
it does have some type u shaped handle (hoop) on the side
but it's flat and would only be useful for some type of pan that had a bar sticking up on the side to catch the hoop.
these monitors are great so far.
"unfortunately, one of the eris e5 monitors of the pair was doa, but the seller worked with me to return the single defective monitor (as opposed to all 3 speakers) and replaced it with another one.  "
"have these hooked up to an audio switcher to switch between my computer, recording audio interface and v-drum kit."
everything sounds great running through these monitors.
"also i love that the sub comes with a ""stompbox"" that will bypass the sub and run the e5 monitors at full range."
needed a new mousepad for my office and wanted something with a bit of a cuteness to it.
"and what, may i ask, is cuter than a kitten playing dress up?"
nothing.
that's what.
"the wrist support it's nice and firm, though still cushiony- just like a kitten's tummy."
only with this you don't run the rush of multiple scratches and bites because mousepad-kitty doesn't mind if you touch her tummy.
"anyway, it's great."
good size.
does what it needs to do.
and it's adorable.
"the flavor is excellent, no chalky taste and the results are subtle but worthwhile."
it took me a while to come around because i have been using other endurance and recovery products.
i like the fact that there is protein too.
i feel like this is the best bang for the buck right now.
meeting doc perry in person at a recent event was the key to trying and sticking with this product.
i might not have ever noticed it.
for more info check out doc perry's site.
great product fits perfect
i bought this toothpaste for my periodontal disease.
i haven't used it long enough to know for sure it is helping.
want to finish the tube first.
as of now i like it.
it's a dry taste but really not bad at all.
"at this point i may consider buying 2 tubes next time, one for myself and 1 for my son."
love this electric blanket blanket.
it is the softest blanket ever.
been dying to have a travel size of this face soap for years!  
i finally decided to check amazon
and i am so happy they carry it.  
"i travel a lot, and to have to squeeze the face soap from the larger tube into a container has been less than ideal.  "
product is authentic and will definitely buy again when this runs out!  
perfect travel size.
i like the fact that this is not flimsy nor feels like it will break in your hand.  
the length is so handy.
i can move around my cubicle while holding my phone.
"beautifully made, and does exactly what is meant to do."
created an amazing transformation in my playing.
never owned capo before
"and i'm very happy with the quality, and value of jigmo capo."
i would recommend it to anyone.
woolite pet stain and odor
remover spray is an amazing product.  
it is so good at removing pet stains that it is hard to believe.  
when i spray it on a carpet stain at times it will actually disappear before my eyes.  
i have tried everything on the market and none can compare to this product.
i needed this to cover a sump pump in our basement family room.  
it is tall enough to be over the pipes and with a tablecloth
the corner is totally covered without having to worry if we ever do get water in the basement.  
good quality and easy to put together
i wanted this issue to start my diet to lose weight.
dr. ordered.
it is exactly what i needed.
meals were prepared ahead of time and stored for the week.
thank you good recipes too.
the hair arrived better than i expected.
i was a little hesitant of the color as my hair isn't just one solid color.
but the hair extensions blended in just fine because the hair has multiple colors within it
so matching was not an issue whatsoever.
(in my opinion this hair could match a couple shades of light brown hair).
i bought both the light and dark hair and there is no difference in quality or smoothness for the lighter shade.
"very impressed with the texture and feel of the hair, glad i went with this product as it did not disappoint."
"i love the look of this item, haven't used it yet, but i know it will get many compliments when i do!"
this dress is gorgeous!  
my daughter used it for homecoming and loved it.
fabric is nice and has a shine to it.
well made too.
i would expect to pay about $60 in a store for this one.
burgundy color was accurate from the photo.
works like a charm perfect replacement for my permanent make up machine
these are good protective glass sheets for the face of the phone.
there are 2 in the pack which is more than you need unless you lose one somehow.
this is my third bottle of duo fusion.
i t has helped me with stomach problems over other products.
i would recommend it to a friend.
the bag has a lot of room and works perfectly holding the laptop
"well made, looks good, adjusts to any size easily."
"arrived on time, bonus cleaning pads for fitbit face included."
great price.
i couldn't be happier with these clip ins!
right when i opened the box i knew i was going to love them.
the hair is silky smooth and each piece is just as dense and great as the others.
it blends perfectly with my natural hair and the clips are nice and sturdy.
i also straighten my hair 99% of the time and these extensions just work so well with my daily look.
all in all i'm really happy with them!
this table is exactly as described and what i needed.  
the packaging was sufficient and it arrived intact.
the instructions were adequate.
fits perfectly and goes well with the artsy cup i already had.
my daughter loves this mouse pad.
effective and comfortable.
very cute and a good price.
works perfectly!  
my dog barks the whole time he is in the car if he is in his crate -
this allows him to be on the seat (with a seat cover) and still be safe and not in my lap!
"this is a terrific, sturdy table for outside entertaining.  "
it's stable with no wobbles and has nice heavy glass.  
love it!
"this is the best capo i ever had , well manufactured and perfect fit for my acoustic and electric guitars , the silver color matched beautifully with my resonator ."
free picks with holder and a nice pouch included !
"i purchased these for my 4'10"" mother."
she raves about the back support they give her.
this is a great egg crate mattress pad!
the 1.5 density of the foam makes a big difference.
my husband loves it.
it was well worth the little bit higher price.
absolutely love the fabrics in this jelly roll.
i paired with a purple fabric for border and backing and made a jelly roll race quilt.
fit right in with our patio furniture.
"good looking, fine quality, super price and fast service.  "
thank you
"great fit, nice material, looks nice on my husband who is 6’2 and wears xl."
"♡love the case design, good quality & fits my galaxy mega phone :)"
great bundle for charging my phone.
they are well made and i have no complaints.
better quality that expected.
so far i am really liking this band.  
fits comfortably and works well.
"very happy with these, the pump would take some time to blow these up"
but i used my air compressor as i don't intend to deflate them and re-inflate them often
these cables are heavy yet flexible with a good solid feel to the plug.
we shall see how long they last but so far so good!
they are good quality pants.
fits me a little small  then my other reebok sweat pants tho.
looks better than a clear top.  
get so many complimments
i get this for i give this five stars because it's a good product
but ..........avg needs to work on their customer service
these are heavy duty and work great and fast when charging.
i am glad  we made this purchase.
no complaints here.
works just fine for my hpenvy 360.
no other issues.
"i want a backup unit, so this searves the purpose."
wonderful colors and designs.
they feel the need in a variety of projects.
best pet stain cleaner i have found!
"it is quick, no soaking or waiting needed."
eves
exactly what i ordered.
fits great and havent had any problems with it.
"i really like the size of the clips because even though they aren't that big, they hold the extensions in lace really well."
"regardless of how thin your hair is, the extensions look really natural and go unnoticeable."
"bag looks like photo, is sturdy, has strong strap, thanks, i love it!"
quick shipping.
well made.
"instead of opening on its side, it may be easier to use if it flip-open at the bottom."
"as it is now, it is difficult to hold it since it is bulky."
awesome and cute!
very good
works great
works extremely well.  
pleasant odor.
😉
👍

the quality is great
so i never have issues with either straightening or curling it.
"in fact, i'm not afraid to do anything to it because it never gets damaged!"

👍

aló ok
i needed to return this.  
sorry.
i ordered these for my husband who is a huge gamer.  
"even though hes in his forties, he's still a child at heart, but still knows quality when he sees and hears it.  "
he had amazing things to say about these headphones.  
"first of all, they worked wonderfully well for his xbox live features where he games with others over the internet and needs to communicate.  "
he's used them on skype to talk to his parents who live across the country and the sound is amazing.  
he even uses them to listen to music and states with these headphones he can hear distinctions in some of his favorite music that he's never heard before.  
the flexible mic is one of his favorite options because he can place it just right
so its not annoying to him to use.  
he also loves the big stout foam cushion at the top of the headphones because he constantly likes to trim his hair short - military style - and other brands has rubbed.
"he's stated, over and over again, that these are the best pair of headphones hes used in a long long time.  "
i'm happy with them because hes thrilled with them.  
i received them at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  
these are definitely husband approved
so i'm going to recommend them to anyone looking for great headphones!
//
why i ordered this
product?just another case to my arsenal.
i am looking for a case that has multiple card slots since i ripped my last
one.//pros:this case seems to be on par with wallet style cases as far as quality goes.
i will update in the future if that were to change.  
the open magnet catch works
"well, you can open it and it will catch when folded onto itself."
great idea.//cons:
"this case doesn’t have a strap, if it has too many cards or cash stuffed inside, it will not close all the way."
"but, that is obviously using it not the way it’s intended."
"i also don’t care for the clear plastic material that holds the phone, especially at night using the flash as it illuminates the rest of the plastic."
the last point i like to make is the look of the phone.
a couple of guys at work made a comment that it wasn’t too manly of a case.
soooooo.
that is a bummer.
i thought it was cool.
but looking at it- it could be confused as a tiny clutch.//would i buy again?i
"think the manly, or lack of manly looks has ruled this one out for me."
"but, it still is a very good case.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------about me: 36 year old us navy veteran, father of 4 (16-2yrs old)."
"likes: ps4, colder weather, trendy lumberjack/beach style, mac versus pc, value not low-cost, graphic design and videography."
"i am always taking my dog with me in the car, he rides well in the car and stays on the back  seat."
"however, i am concerned about his saftey in the event of an accident."
in the past  i have tied leashes to headrests and have used carabiner clips to attach short leads.
he either end up tangled in the excess leads or are still not 100% safe.
this product allows my dog to safely ride in the car without getting tangled up in extra leash.
this saftey lead is adjustable
so it is long enough for my german shepherd and short enough for my miniature pinscher.
i no longer have to worry about broken legs or them escaping if there is an accident.
this product is also excellent for dogs that will not stay in the back while riding in cars.
"this seatbelt leash is made of strong webbing, the snap hook and the tongue that buckles into the car are both metal."
it is perfect for dogs of all sizes.
for saftey reasons never attach this product to the dogs collar ( like shown in the last picture.)
in the unfortunate event of an accident the force may snap the dogs neck.
i recommend always using a body harness.

"for this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality."
one must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer.
i think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and i believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyers.
"with regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, i believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style."
that is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship/finish nor is it something that i would rate as outstanding.
the quality of the piece is such that i feel it is a good value for the money.
"finally, as with many products of this type, the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation."
"when i ordered this product my expectations were moderate, especially because of the price."
"in an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead."
"i did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good, if not just a tad bit better than good."
"for that reason, and those set out above, i'd make a recommendation to buy this product."
note:
i received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for the promise to file an honest and unbiased review.
"to meet that obligation, i typically use the product for an extended period, no less than two weeks, and under the typical conditions that one might use for a product of this type."
i am so thrilled to find this product on amazon!!!
i play competitive tennis outdoors in the heat and have found ultra26 to be the best endurance enhancer ever!
"it come with very clear instructions on when to take it for the best results, and has extensive research information as well."
this is the real deal for anyone who wants to get more out of their game.
thank you ultra26!karen
a whiteley
i really liked this basket...not flimsy at all.
it was just too big for the pan i was using...
didn't want to purchase another pan.
this was a gift for my nephew.
according his mom it was a big hit.
she even ordered more the next day!
we ordered a king and a queen.
"no tracking on the queen,(i think its being shipped from china)"
but the king came promptly.
the packaging is very nice.
"the english has been translated from chinese, so a little funny!"
the king is perfect on our king size mattress.
light and lofty and warm.
"says organic cotton, but i wonder how it can be organic and bleached white...."
there is a little tag at the bottom that says 50% wgd
....
what does that mean?
(white goose down?)
the other 50% is feather?
"you can feel feathers, but not bad."
we are looking for organic covers now.
"the cotton fabric is very smooth and soft, and there is no bad smell."
never owned down comforters before and am satisfied with this purchase.
"great 1/4"" replacement for old, shorted stereo jacks.  "
i used one of thes to replace the stereo jack on an expensive pair of headphones that had a defect in the jack.  
this jack was easy to solder and saved me from about a $40.00 repair bill.
"capo works great, i use it as a back up to my other that i prefer."
love that little pick holder.
"the picks are so-so, but fine for back ups."
terrific cup!
"our boss bought our office a frappe machine and so we bought a variety of tall cups to enjoy our afternoon treats in, this cup was perfect!"
thank you.
i received the package.
i received a notification by mail
and i picked up the parcel today.
thank you good goods.
"fits perfectly, looks and feels like real leather."
however opening/closing the case does not turn my moto g4 on/off.
works with my guitar
thank you
happy
happy
great product
this is the cutest and she can
very nice color.
soft and stay's on good.
at very good price
nice
color is exactly like in the photo and fits my fitbit alta perfectly.
fits and works great
love this capo.  
it's very easy to use angus just as easy to keep on the head out of the way.  
- all one handed!  
"no buzzing or dead strings, just clean sound ity appears that it will last as long as my guitar."
very well made!
so i'm obsessed with phone cases.
i buy a lot.
and i'm not kidded or embellishing when i say this is so far the best phone case i have bought.
you can detached the phone in the case from the wallet.
the case is actually rubber instead of the hard plastic that a lot of other cases have.
it also comes with a screen protective cover to cover the screen which i would definitely recommend if you have an iphone since their screens break easily and you will drop your phone at least once.
this one also has a longer clasp that is also magnetic.
the longer clasp is so much better because if you are like me you have a lot of cards and insurance cards and ect.
that you need to carry so
i appreciate that.
it also has more card slots than the other wallet cases which i also appreciate.
i love this case and will probably buy another one in a different color to switch it up.
the quality of the wallet case seems really durable
so i do not see it breaking from regular wear and tear anytime soon.
i would recommend this product to anyone who likes wallet cases or is looking for a good quality one that is not that expensive.
(i received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review)
amazing
pretty much title.
they're awesome earbuds
"and i hope they last, as i've only had them for 5 days at this point."
the sound quality and volume control are awesome.
everything comes through clear.
and i love how the volume control actually has distinct buttons.
"a downside with my previous headphones was that they also had volume and track control, but it was all one large, dynamic button which could lead to inadvertently pausing or even skipping a song when you just want to make it louder or quieter."
not the case at all here.
"speaking of cases, i do enjoy the fact that they came in a tin and"
inside that tin was a pouch with them inside.
"it's a very neat way to carry them around and much better, in my opinion, than just throwing them in my pocket."
"i don't think that helped with my poor, old headphones that got all tangled up."
these also seem to be slightly longer than the other headphones i had (which were akg brand and the ones that came with my smartphone).now
the only issue i've had thus far and which has mostly gone away is comfort.
"they didn't fit well in my ears at first, although that may have just been me adjusting to them"
i will admit.
if that's the case then i really don't see any flaws with these.
but otherwise...
yeah.
"they were difficult to wear for the first day or so with my ears actually hurting when i had them in, yet ever since then it's been perfectly fine."
again it might just be me
but i felt it was worth mentioning regardless.
what a great product.
"the cable looks good, is easy to untangle, and the packaging was very good, even including a small drawstring bag to keep them in."
"the memory foam ear tips were super comfortable, and also other sizes of"
silicone ear tips were included and they were easy to change.
"the sound quality is excellent for listening to music, podcasts, and my meditation recordings."
i like the ludos brand always because there send email to you to talking about their company history
", it's a nice personal touch showing that they value their customers."
"for the price, i would definitely recommend this product."
"i have only had these for a few weeks, but so far they were a fantastic purchase."
the sound is great.
"i didn't mean to get earphones that cancel the noise so well, but i can still hear the outside world if i keep the sound on low."
it is nice to be able to music with a low volume on the bus or airplane and be able to hear the entire song.
they were perfect for the plane since they cut out all of the noise
and i was able to sleep.
"i was happy that they came with such little packaging, there was really minimal plastic packaging, but everything was neatly packed."
the memory foam buds are really nice and don't fall out of my ears.
i haven't tried the other ones because i'm happy with the foam ones.
the cord seems thick enough to withstand some accidents and it is really long so it is good for threading under a jacket.
i really hope they last because they are very nice.
love these earphones.
they sit comfortably without sticking out like some earphones out there.
the sounds quality is excellent with deep bass and very clear mid and high tones.
even at high volumes the sound quality does not distort or change.
the quality almost matches more expensive earphones like sennheiser.
build quality is very good with anti-tangle cables and a solid 3.5mm jack.
definitely recommend trying this out.
i think it is the best you can get for the price.
for $30 these are about twice as good as you would expect to pay.
"for little earbuds they provide great sound, the cord is braided"
"so it bends easy and is durable, and the controls/microphone are as good or better than anything i have tried.  "
these would be solid earphones for $50 but for $30 they are phenomenal.  
after having gone through probably 20 sets over the past 8 years these are the best ones i have tried yet.  
you won't be disappointed.
the first thing is that these sounded great - much better than i expected for the price.
nice crisp highs and solid bass.
i am musician so not easy to please in this department.
the comfort and fit of the ear bud - memory foam - very nice - comfortable and don't fall out of your ears when moving around or eating.
the cables on ear buds often are flimsy and usually the first thing to go bad -
but this cord is nice and think yet flexible.
finally the volume control actually is
functional - must admit got more than i expected.
these earbuds are brilliant!
"very loud, clear and have a great base."
use them about 4-5 times a week at the gym.
"prefer to use these than the apple-supplied headphones with a cane my iphone 8.now using with the apple supplied connector, but working just as well."
"bought a pair of sony earbuds at the same time, ended up giving the sony earbuds ones away to my kid brother!pure sound, great for listening to music."
a+
i love earbuds that come with foam tips instead of traditional tips.
these in particular provide a lot of sound isolation and give you the choice between a few different sizes to make sure they fit your ears properly (i have funky ears and use two different sizes).the controls are very nice
", they feel good when you click them."
"they are also the normal commands that you find in other earbuds, so they are easy to use."
the wire has a textured finish to it that give it a premium look.
they come with a really nice pouch that both protects yours earbuds and prevents them from getting all tangled up.
overall good product for the price.
"i listen to a lot of music, usually joe bonamassa and beth hart, andi typically spend a couple of hours a day listening to and studying aforeign language."
"a few years back i spent between $150 - $200 to get a pair of over theear phones, from a top brand manufacturer."
i had noticed that the female speakers were a lot harder to hear andunderstand than the male speakers.
i was always having to turn upthe volume for the female speakers.  
"and even then, i sometimes foundit still difficult to understand what they were saying.  "
and until veryrecently i had just assumed that it was something to do with the website.
i was totally surprised when i started using my new ludos clamorearbuds.
"now, i could completely distinguish what the female speakerswere saying—and best of all, i didn’t have to keep turning up the volumewhen the female speakers came on!these"
ludos clamor earbuds are absolutely fantastic!  
"and at about1/10 the price of my over the ear phones, they are a real joy."
i have even compared listening to joe and beth with my over the ear phonesand these ludos clamor earbuds.
"after running a few quick tests with both,ludos is giving me crystal clear music with deeply rich tones of music!i am planning on enjoying these ludos clamor earbuds for a very longtime; they are a real joy!"
these headphones are actually nicer than some of the other headphones i have bought for this price and even surpass those of a high price (and name brand)
"the sound is excellent and they're made of a decent and sturdy material, the wire is textured but doesn't seem to add any strength to it."
the command bar (the small plastic housing with the buttons) feels thick and robust.
although the memory foam part that goes into your ear feels feels as if it may wear out with long term use
but i've seen no damage to mine so far.
"initially when you received the headphones they come in a small rectangular tin with the name of the company and the product name on the front and the specification such as cable length, max input power, sound pressure, frequency response and thd on the back."
"upon opening the tin you are greeted with a decent quality mesh bag that contains the headphones themselves and a pair of traditional plastic ear inserts (three pair, 6 in total.)"
of varying size.(overall
i say it's worth it
", it's not likely you're going to find a pair of $20 headphones of this quality anywhere else, and if you do."
let me know.)p.s
"i've actually ordered a second pair, these things are great and the cords don't tangle and twist."
"at this pricepoint i honestly wasn't expecting much, most value earbuds sound really bad after all."
i was really surprised that these have
"great clarity, treble and fantastic bass granted that you get proper isolation."
"i did have some issues getting them to seal right in my ears, and they don't come with additional sized foam tips; for this, i dock a star."
i would say the sound is very comparable to apple's earpods.
"for an inexpensive pair of earbuds, the sound is actually quite good."
the claim is that the drivers in the earbuds produce balanced and clear sound and given my time with it
i definitely agree!this is helped by the in-ear design that helps keep sound in and external noise out.
it's not noise canceling though
but that's for the best as it's a lot safer to use outside.
now while the sound is a big part of any earbuds comfort matters just as much so and with the lightweight and nice balance they feel very natural and secure in my ears.
the other features are about as expected.
the remote attached to the earbuds allow you basic functions such as pausing and resuming songs or picking up calls.
"the cord itself feels sturdy and is of decent length, it's not as comforting as kevlar cables but it doesn't worry me about potentially tearing someday."
even if it does there's a lifetime warranty backing these very nice earbuds!
"the rubber earpieces that took over the plastic years ago (although iphone hasn't caught on) was a tremendous improvement, but these foam earpieces are that much more comfortable and secure again.  "
who knew it:
foam: the next generation.  
"i got just what i was hoping for better comfort, better fit, and therefore better sound.  "
"and then to think how little they cost me, good job folks."
i had lost the earpiece of my $12 earbuds.
while searching amazon i saw these.
i like the way they presented the company origin and ethos and was attracted to the new style foam ear piece since the noise isolation function is important to me.
this was a big step up to $20 but they came the next day
and i couldn't believe it.
they are great.
superior quality.
i feel like i could tow a car with the cord.
the foam earbuds fit perfectly and keep external noise out.
"i am not a sound expert, but i hear a full range, high, mid and the base."
the sound is great and makes me realize what i've been missing.
i am hearing new words to songs that i have listened to for years.
"i have not used them yet during a hard workout where i'm sweating, but they feel quite secure in my ear."
"btw, they come with 3 sets of standard rubber earbuds in addition to the foam ones."
well worth the money
and i'll be giving these as holiday gifts to loved ones this year.
these are about what you would expect for the price point in headphones.
they come in a nice mesh bag enclosed in a tin case (min was smashed and bent in shipping) .
"overall quality of the headphone construction are good, and the sound is acceptable."
"tested on different output sources, the headphones produce a bland sound range with the best being in treble and mids."
"i was expecting a bit more umph in the base department after reading reviews and comments but it isnt quite as much as to be expected or much at all.the cord is not a braided cord, it is just a typical rubber with imprint texture, something that is deceiving in the pictures."
cord likes to keep its bent shape unlike nicer braided cords which will unwind flat.
the split from single cord to each headphone is a bit lengthy.
"the foam earbuds could be better, there is only one size which is on the small side."
you will have to adjust them in your ear tword your ear canal or they will block the music coming out of them.  
i am happy that they do come with 3 sizes of regular rubber style ear pads to change out too!remote works as it should and with the foam
"ear pads you get a ""little bit"" more outside sound reduction, but not much more than other traditional rubber ear style headphones.all in all, these are good enough quality for the price, but i expected a bit more from them and have had better sounding, cheaper priced headphones in the past."
foam less comfortable than using the included rubber inserts.  
sound quality typical for the price point.
"not bad, interesting earbuds that have a bit of style to it."
pros:-
"earbud tips are foam like, not like plastic, so there is a bit discomfort at first, but adapts to your ear over a few minutes of time.-"
the wire is coated like a rubber texture.
it's sturdy and flexible.
it's feel's...
whats the word i'm looking for....
"premium quality!- will work between/through any case that protects your phone.- mic is superb, volume control is great, but the control is a bit too far towards the ears and round, not flat, to the feel.- worth the price."
"con's:- has a bit of a bulk on the volume control and end of the plug, nothing to bad.- noise cancellation feels like 20%, not 80%.- a bit of discomfort for a while, but your ears will adapt over time."
"honestly would give this 4/5 star rating, but the foam like earbuds gives it 5/5 star rating, feels way better once your ears get used to it."
worth the price and texture.
give it a shot!
i feel the need to start off that i am one of the pickiest and hardest to please when it comes to my earbuds.
"however, these have been exceptional, even with my tiny ear holes as my kids say."
i’ve been through so many headphones that were torture due to fit and sound quality.
"to fit, i’d use kids ones and for sound quality i’d have to give up my comfort."
"not with these, the foam tips are amazing feeling, the sound is exceptional, and add in they are super durable ( child and pet tested and they survived with no damage)."
"i was so happy with them when my boyfriend’s headphones died, instead of subjecting to my back up pair {they suck)"
i let him use these ones.
he has much larger ears and they work perfectly for him as well.
he is currently sleeping with them in as i am typing this.
"as he was happily dozing he said he wanted a pair, so i ordered him his own in another color."
i’m positive they’ll last a lot longer than the month i’ve had them and longer than the pair my boyfriend killed at work this past week.
i am so glad i chose these ones to try because my searching and buying of earbuds is over.
no more trying out a million different types and brands and such for me anymore.
if mine die (doubtful any time soon)
i will be purchasing myself another pair of these.
"there are bluetooth headphones on the same price range than this headphones, with better sound quality and punshier bass."
"the pair that i got, had the highs and mids clear enough but the mids where somewhat boxy sounding, the bass is almost none existent"
(the description said it had an amazing bass
but it didnt)
and the memory foam ear tips came all destroyed
", they never returned to the form they had to."
"only good things where the litle bag it comes with, and the plastic cable is stronger  than some others with a braided texture and has good length."
"at least customer support where kind enough to do me a full refund, that shows that they care about the product an wich to get better and listen to the customers."
"maybe i got a bad pair, who knows,"
"likes:-sound quality is solid and for the fairly limited amount of time i've used these, seem to be pretty well representative of the audio source output.-inline controls (8"" from earbud) are basic (volume up/"
"down, pause/play or call answer/hangup) and fully functional-inline mic apparently works; a couple of phone calls worked fine, both for the other end to hear me and me to hear the other end caller-braided cabling is coated for entire combined length (3') with a braided, slightly less-textured rubberized breakout to each earbud (18"")-packaged in small, tin box-comes with small, padded-mesh carrying bag"
"-includes 4-pair tips; 1-foam pair on the earbuds and 3-silicon pair (sm/med/lg), bagged separately-under $20!dislikes:-the"
"only that comes to mind would be if these had the increasingly common in-bud magnets that allow the buds to ""stick"" together."
"super useful for the times when one needs to pull the buds from ears and have them secured around the wearer's neck, vs having to find somewhere/way to manage the buds until returning to ears or removing them"
"entirely-----------------------------fwiw: in respect to noise-cancellation, these are not equipped with any active nc, nor engineered for any passive nc other than characteristics borne of the mating between the earbud tip and the user's ear opening."
"get a ""good seal"", play some audio and you're naturally going to almost certainly hear less ""outside noise"" than if your ears were open and exposed."
"this obviously would be true for virtually any substance that blocks the ear's passageway, be that these earbuds, another set of earbuds, wadded up facial tissue, your fingers, etc."
"appears to me there are some real misconceptions out there regarding what is and what is not, noise cancellation."
these wired earbuds are outstanding.  
they are an exceptional value for the money.  
"the sound quality is equal to, if not better than, the boise earphones that i had bought for about $150.  "
"the reason that i bought them, however, was the reinforced wires.  "
"all of my previous earphones, including the boise ones, have gone the way of the trashcan because they have developed shorts or broken wires where the one cable splits into two for the two ear pieces.  "
these earbuds are nicely reinforced along all of the wires.
"soon after buying them, i took them on a trip to portugal.  "
they were comfortable for the 8 hour flight and worked well in the airplane's entertainment system (rather than the earphones supplied by the airline).  
i most frequently is them with my ipod and find the stereo separation to be excellent.  
i highly recommend these earbuds and will be buying another pair for myself.
pros- cost- controller is compatible with galaxy s8.-
"includes carry case,  a nice felt bag, and extra ear"
cushions.- feels well
built-
very comfortablecons-
the right memory foam cushion was slightly damaged.
no harm
no foul..
i already have a couple of sets of memory foam cushions i previously purchased on amazon.
"search for ""comply"
"17-50101-11 isolation noise cancelling memory foam earphone tips for""  if you need a replacement.-"
the extra cushions are not memory foam cushions.
they are round rubber cushions.
not a show stopper but nice to know.- does not include and instruction manual.
these come packaged so sweet!
they come with a little mesh bag and a little metal box to keep them in.
"now, the best thing i love is the memory foam earbuds."
they custom fit to the inside if your ear and are so comfortable it's insane.
"they also work as some outside noise reduction,  too and they never come loose or fall out."
never.
the cord is a braided type plastic that feels super premium.
these earbuds also sound great.  
these buds are worth more than $20.
you won't be sorry for picking these up.
great pair of earbuds for everyday use under $20.  
sound great and comfortable!  
you will not be disappointed with these earbuds.
the sound is even and well balanced.  
good bass without overpowering the vocals.  
highs and mids sound great too.  
great overall sound played at low and high sound volumes.  
"foam earbuds fit snug in my ears without any indication of falling out, even during gym workouts.  "
i tried shaking my head side to side as hard as i could and still they did not budge.  
sound isolation is good but not completely isolating at low sound volumes.
i could hear some noises around me.  
just turn up the volume and problem fixed.  
don't push the earbuds too far into your ears or your ears will start to ache after a while.  
i think this is true with any foam earbuds.  
they come with 3 pairs of silicone earphones if you don't like the foam.
comes in a nice metal box with a mesh carrying bag which is great for storage and keeping them safe.  
very strong cable and jack.  
the microphone is plastic but easy to use and works just fine.
great earbuds for everyday use!!!!
"i was looking for some really good quality ear buds for travel purposes, and i’ve used these a couple times now"
and i love them.
"great sound quality , natural base to music."
"came in tin can carrying case which was cool too, so when i’m not using them i put them back in it"
"this is far better performance than any earbuds i've ever used before, considering i used them for hours every day and wasn't overly careful with the wire (often quickly jamming them into a jean pocket or bag).the flat wire makes them nice and sturdy"
and they really don't tangle
", i was very impressed."
"the sound quality is very good, again better than any others i've bought before in the same price bracket."
the addition of multiple sized rubber covers for the earbuds is great as you can figure out which one fits you best and provides the best noise-canceling seal.
"for the price, these are great little earbuds"
and i would definitely recommend them.
main issue i have with this is that the mic is not working well.
"some sound is registered, but not much."
which is annoying as my main purpose for these earphones is for use in skype/zoom meetings at work.
the cheap earphones that i had planned to replace with this set works way better in that regard.
but the sound coming out is good.
and i really like the storage box they provided (and the bag).
everything packaged really well.
so i may keep them just for home use only.
"edit oct 26, 2019: have to update my star rating - customer support was very impressive given that they are such a small company!"
"they sent me a replacement set free of charge, and although that didn't work out for me, they refunded me without asking my to return either of my sets."
"so, ok i can't use the mic as i hoped for work conferences, but at least i have some nice earphones for other activities (and the mic does work with my phone, just not with my work laptop)."
very impressive support.
at first i was a little bit skeptical about headphones with memory foam earpieces
but they are actually super comfortable.
they fit in my ears great and the sound is very good!
i love the braided nylon cords and they feel very sturdy.
i would definitely buy them again!
"for the money, these are great headphones."
firstly they come with loads of spare buds and a quality bag to keep everything in.
the cables being laces instead of cables are good at staying untangled and don’t knot.
the phones are comfortable to wear and have great sound.
the sound is deep so if you like base sounds you’ll be even more pleased.
but i like the most because the rubber buds cut out a lot of outside noise so i can enjoy the music in quiet on the train commuting.
excellent sound quality for a $20 set of in ears.
"clear and balanced, slightly bass heavy (and boomy)"
", so i set my iphone eq to “off” and it’s balanced."
which is actually impressive to have in ears that are built with a balanced eq.
"the foam ear buds provide great noise canceling, are comfortable, and they don’t fall out of our ears!"
hallelujah.
also the volume control and track pause
/skip is nice to have.
well done ludos!
(the only reason i didn’t give them five stars is because they’re slightly boomy).
i purchased these headphones and was very impressed with their quality from the start.
the packaging for the headphones is a small metal box with a cushioned cloth bag containing the headphones inside.
very professional and a good first impression.
sound quality is the best i've seen in the $20 range once i tuned the equalizer on my s9
+
(which i've had to do with every headphone and speaker i've owned.)
these beat every headphones in the $20 range i have used and it easily rivals higher priced headphones i have purchased in the past.
the foam earpieces are very comfortable and it comes with three sets of rubber earpieces.
"i'm excited to see how long these last, especially since most of my earbuds stop working after a few months."
the build quality gives me hope since they seem to be well built.
crisp highs and solid bass.
snug fit
so they block out a lot of background noise too.
great for mowing the lawn or while working in a loud environment as i do.
very comfortable while wearing 6+ hours per day!
is also really nice to be able to control the volume or pause from the small control on the right earphone wire.
can't go wrong for the price.
things i like:
quality cable casingselection of different size
earbudsthe case and mesh bagthe ability to control from the volume on the cord that everyone has nowadays.
things i don’t like:
that i have to adjust the eq every time i switch bands.
"i’m a metal head, listen to bands like:"
"thy art is murder, fit for an autopsy, whitechapel"
", blah blah blah..."
just switching between those three bands makes me go into my eq settings on spotify and fix how these sound.
"too much bass,"
"way too much mid, no highs, and switch them all around for the next band."
"i constantly notice too much mid, no highs, monotone bass."
i don’t venture outside of this genre of music often which is why i’m leaving four stars.
maybe they’re awesome for what your taste is in music.
"however, to the metal heads of the world, look elsewhere."
all i can say is these are a surprize♡♡♡♡the sound so amazing that i have to check to see if i am actually wearing the ear buds.#1.
"i can not feel them, and maybe because of te memory foam that just fits.. also no outside noises to interfere.  "
to me crystal
"clear, from all tones high to low, as if the room is full of surround sound.., love them!!!"
"they did come with regular replacement ear pads, but i hope i never lose these,"
wow...
after my initial review the company promptly replied to me and sent me a replacement.
looks like i got a faulty pair.
i'm very happy with the sound and how comfortable these are.
"i wouldn't hesitate to buy them again, especially knowing their customer service is on point.--------i loved these earphones while they lasted."
i have been using them for less than a month and the left side is completely dead :(
just received these earbuds and love them.
they fit so well and comfortable.
the sound quality is excellent.
i am not looking for bose sound in my life so these tiny titans fit the bill.
they came in a nice mesh pouch which is enclosed in a metal box.
"for the money, these are an excellent buy."
they are also sturdy with volume and pause controls right on the earbud wires.
"i was specifically looking for earbuds that would stay in my ears when working out, as sweat tends to make them wiggle out of my ear canal."
"the foam material these are made out of keeps them snugly in my ears, and the material also provides very good noise cancellation -"
a friend had to tap my shoulder because i couldn't hear him calling me with them in.
"the actual sound quality is good for the price, the bass is especially noticeable."
"overall, i recommend these over similarly priced offerings."
finally i found earphones that fit in my ears.  
also the quality of these headphones is amazing.
they're loud and you can control them
however you want.
they come in a small box and pouch.
can't say enough.
finally i found earphones that fit in my ears.

can't say enough.
i must say that the sound quality is very good and these earphones are very comfortable because of the memory foam.
the cable is very well made and the wire remains stright when i pull the earphones out of my pocket.
i love them
a friend encouraged me to buy a high quality pair of earphones after i kept complaining about how bad my dollar store cheapies sounded.
i did a little research and chose these.
best decision ever!
the sound is amazing and clear as a bell.
the volume is easily adjusted on the cord.
"love this product, will definitely recommend to my friends!"
really surprised of the quality of these earbuds.  
the fitment in the ear is very secure.  
had no issues of them coming out while exercising.  
the sound quality is very good for the price.  
nice highs and decent base.  
i bought a few of these in different colors because of the price.  
the colors are very vibrant.
really hoped to like these.
good reviews.
bright color
so i wouldn't lose them.
"however, they were noisy."
"i get that these are supposed to suit gamers, but any friction on the cords translated into static.  "
"since i bought them to listen to podcasts while i worked, anytime the cords touched anything, including themselves, it was noisy and annoying.  "
thinking
"i just got a bad pair, i emailed the company."
nada.
crickets.  
"i waited too long for a reply that never came, so missed the return deadline.  "
don't waste your money.
from my husband: i lost my headphones while on a trip and needed a quick ship for some new ones that were the right price.
"and dang, did i find a good deal!"
these wired buds have a very crisp sound and do well with voice calls as well.
i really liked the braided style rubber around the cording too.
"especially for the price, i would highly recommend these headphones for on the go good tunes."
these headphones are great!
they don't slip out of my ears and are super cushy.
i also love the tin they arrived in.
i love the sound and the volume control on the cord.
wow these earphones are the best.
they look expensive and actually function better than my other apple earphones.
they are comfortable to use and the sound quality is very clear.
i love that you can control the volume which is a plus.
and pick up calls at the same time.
overrall i love these earphones.
they are a must buy!
i bought these mainly because they had a slim enough plug to fit inside my phone case's narrow aux port.
"i typically use bluetooth but there are scenarios in which i can't use bluetooth (like when i'm in the gym, sadly), so i needed a wired headphone with a slim port"
but that wasn't flimsy.
these are that.
sound good.
i like the foamy earbuds
", they're weird and different but nice."
"unfortunately, the right ear doesn't always work."
"i've only used them maybe a dozen times and within the first few uses, the right ear would go out a little."
"not entirely, but a noticeable decrease in just that one."
probably just a faulty pair
so i still rated this product highly enough
the first thing i noticed was the nifty little metal case.
the earphones are nice and protected.
it also helps to keep them from getting tangled up in your pocket.
they seem to have a good durable build to them.
"they fit nicely in my ear, which is something i always seem to have trouble with."
the sound quality is great!
"these are well with the price, and more."
i bought this for my dad to use on his phone and samsung tablet.
he spends a lot of time watching/
listening to online content.
he is extremely pleased with the sound quality and how sturdy the earphone is.
he enjoys watching netflix and youtube even with grand kids playing around him.
highly recommend for the quality and sturdiness.
my one complaint about these earbuds is how they used memory foam instead of regular plastic; i prefer the rubber—that’s just me.
"they produce great music quality for the price asked, and the wiring is stronger (cords are sturdy) than most earbud brands."
good bang for your buck.
"i really love the memory foam earplugs, they are more comfortable than most and they gave me 2 addition pair.  "
i also like the cord.
"instead of the cheap vinyl cords that most are made out of, this one is sturdy and doesn't tangle as easy.  "
well worth the money.
i gave these headphones a full month trial before reviewing them.
"these headphones shock my ears repeatedly (mainly the left earphone, but the right side does shock me occasionally as well) and will turn the sound down until they are fully muted at random times."
what stinks is that this didn't start occurring until i had been using them for about two weeks.
i have no idea if i just was sent a bad pair or that these are just poorly made.
i would definitely not recommend them to anyone nor would i ever be interested in purchasing any other product from this company if this is the quality that their products are.
i really like the strength of the cord.
i tripped (to my shame) on them once and they work just fine.
the sound quality is grand and the earphones fit my ears perfectly.
"they don't even tangle much, which is cool, since i keep them in my pocket all the time."
getting it as a christmas gift.
the earphone comes with two replacement buds and a bag in a metal box.
tried to listen from it some spotify songs and the sound quality is pretty good.
volume control works well.
better than my iphone earphone.
i am using these earphones everyday.
the sound is clear and there is also a good bass for the price.
the microphone is very good even if i am having a conversation in a middle of a crowd.
very comfortable for my ears!
never used memory foam earphones before and i am very surprised for the good quality.
the sound is super and i like very much the design.
i was looking for a new set of earphones for my switch.
when i was looking on this site i went through all different kinds of earphones
i probably went through 20 different kinds.
i landed on these because it was a reasonable offer it gave.
for only $19.90 i didn't really expect a differ in quality from a normal $10 pair but when i started listening to music and play games i noticed how those with a cheaper or close to same price didn't have as good soundproof buds that these had.
i even tried them while it was windy outside
and i could barely even hear the wind rustling the trees near me.
great pair of headphones.
i was surprised at how comfortable they are to wear.
great sound quality.
worth every penny.
they quit working a few days after the window of return closed.
they had poor sound quality and didn't stay in the ears no matter what size earplugs i used.
i just wish i would have returned them when i first bought them.
great for lower cost headphones.
only downside is they don’t work with the new iphones
great earbud for the price!  
"better sound, better comfort and the cord doesn't tangle up as easily as my iphone cord earbuds do.  "
"the packaging was a big surprise with the earbuds in a pouch, and then it a small metal box.  "
i highly recommend these if you are like me and like wired earbuds.  
i will be buying other pairs more pairs in different colors - because i can!
i returned these headphones because the control buttons did not work with my pixel xl.
neither the volume nor the stop/resume buttons did what they were supposed to do.
instead they caused my phone to go into a weird state
"and i couldn't close the amazon music app, forcing me to restart the phone."
i purchased headphones from another company with a usb-c connector and they behave as expected.
"i rate at 4.5 stars overall - great sound, super value, and good volume/pause control using my moto 7 phone.  "
my only recommendation for improvement is that the memory phone ear tips should be more substantial.  
"the current ones are too small for my ears to get a good seal, but ludos does provide an assortment of typical rubber tips as well"
great quality earphones.
the sound quality is awesome.
i wanted them to run outside and they are perfect they don’t slip they just fit right.
these headphones are so soft you can’t even feel them.
sound quality is great and they work gret with all my devices.
great headphones.
i recently lost my favorite pair of headphones and needed to replace them.
these headphones are just as good as my old pair.
"love the cord, it doesn't tangle and has a nice feel to it!"
"the headphones came in a tin case and a small, padded mesh bag."
the sound quality is really good.
i am impressed with the overall quality of these.
worth every penny.
udos clamor earphones in-ear headphones with audio
", new generation are very good choice, they came with a box and  mini bag where you can hold them"
and you can hang them on the bag.
the headphones are compatible with every phone computer or notebook.
"these headphones are great, they are super comfortable."
when i originally bought them
i thought the memory foam wouldn’t make a difference.
"well let me tell you it does, i love these headphones!"
very nice product .  
i like memory form  
constable
and i recommended
amazing sound quality and super loud.
shipped super fast.
crisp and clear.
nice set of headphones!
"cant belive the sound i get out of these things, very suprised!"
love them
and i highly recomand them.
very good quality.
the sound is great.
and it fits perfect
these headphones are a wonderful option for their price point.  
they offer good sound quality.  
there was actually good bass for songs that need it.  
i used them when cleaning the house the other day and they were comfortable for more than than the hour that i was working.  
the come with the memory foam as well as the traditional rubbery kinds for your ears
so you can choose which is better for you.
these were great for the first three weeks!
"the audio quality ain't bad, and they're decent at cancelling noise."
"unfortunately, within a month of buying them, they started shocking the inside of my ears whenever i moved, /especially/ when i stood up."
"i keep them nice and untangled on my desk, and only use them for light office work, so i'm mystified as to how this could've happened.  "
save yourself some nasty shocks and look elsewhere.
"these little babies rock, for the following  reasons:  "
-solidly  build metal enclosures  
-the tangle-free  cable  that  actually  does  not  tangle  
-good  bass  
"range, comparable  to  dre  "

-multipe

"loud,even on  lower-end  phone ,such  as  amps  "
(tested  on  a  nexus  6p)
these are very nicely made headphones with a very nice length to the cord.
customer service is excellent.  
great communication and dedication to making their customer happy.
work great.
fit nicely and dont hurt my ears.
the sound is great too.
the sound is great.
i like how they fit in my ears
", i also like that they came with a case already, which is not low quality."
highly recommended.
these are my new favorite headphones!
"they fit comfortably in my ears, and they are very loud and give out great clear sound."
i use these to work out in and they stay in my ears while i run!
i would recommend to anyone!
worth the money!
so far i really like these buds.
"they sound great, have real nice bass and clear highs."
"i do wish the pair of foam tips were a little bigger, or had more sizes, i think that would help block more sound."
i cut fire wood and love to jam while running the saw.
the cord seems like it should hold up to the work and they are definitely loud enough to drown out the sound of the screaming saw.
"so far i am really enjoying these, will see how it goes after a few jobs."
the sound quality is great.
i’ve had some not so good ones.
these are definitely worth the cost.
"plus, if comes with it’s on lil carrying case."
nice touch.
sad i purchased this ... there so many problems with it 1)
"mic ,"
"when i use on playing game , my friends complaining about echo, 2) there is no bass at all, original earphone from apple 3x better"
then this ....
it is so funny so many positive comments....
wonderful pair of ear plugs!!
it fits nicely and has great sound.
the cord seems strong and reliable.
"ludos product is well made, attractive for small wired buds, has slightly above average overall sound, decent bass with bass boost, vocals are super clear, and midrange instruments stand out.  "
i like the memory foam
inserts-
they stay in during work.  
"my only criticism is why did the package come with 3 sizes of silicone inserts, instead of a replacement memory foam set."
the earbuds are working well so far.
i like the way the way they are designed.
i would like the cord to be about 6 inches longer
but they are still a great set of earbuds.
dang these are great for the money.
fabric so they don't tangle so much.
little bag for storage.
ear cushions don't fall off.
these things are great.
solid head phones for the price they are listed as.
worth a buy if you like this type of ear phones.
they don’t hurt your ears if they are in for a long period of time buds are very soft.
after a history of pretty crappy earphones from amazon i found these and they were great!
the memory foam does take a little getting used to but after a while it feels really natural in your ear
"(they include normal earphone tips if you don't like them, though.)"
"the sound quality is great, almost as good as an expensive headset i have."
all around solid headphones with a nice cable and a nice little bag to carry them around in.
good buy!
they have a very comfortable fit and sound great.
i’ve recommended these to some co-workers and they love them too.
i’m very satisfied with this purchase.
"they feel extremely comfortable, easy to put in, not to mention they came a few days early!"
was in the market for a new pair of headphones
and i'm happy i went with these.
definitely worth trying
amazing quality.
amazing quality.
"the sound of earphone is very clear, it is very comfortable to listen to music,"
"listening to music every day to fall asleep is very good,sound quality moves feeling to have administrative levels, even if wear for a long time also does not matter, the material of line feels very firm。my personal feeling is very satisfied."
"its very softly in my  ears and very comfortable, the sound is amazin"
clear bass.
memory foam pieces are comfortable; i have a hard time finding earbuds that fit my small ears
and they stay in just fine!
comes in a little metal box that includes a mesh holding baggie and rubber pieces in case you don't like the memory foam.
i love these earbuds!  
great bass.
really good headphones.
i mostly use to go to the gym and have a good workout.
my teenager got these
and when she’s wearing them it completely blocks my voice from her hearing.
she probably sees this as a good thing.
for me i have to either enter her room or text her to get her attention.
these are the best earbuds i have ever had!
they are very durable: metal components and a rigid braided wire.
the buds are constructed with ear plug-like foam that block out most external noise and are comfortable.
"in addition, they do not fall out while running."
the sound is very clear and the bass is powerful.
i would definitely buy these again.
"i cannot get the memory foam to form to, or stay, in my ears."
the other black foam replacements are not comfortable and i expected the different  sizes to be from the same memory foam material.
"otherwise they perform well, but i'm not sure i would recommend these to anyone under the circumstances."
i bought these are earbuds based on the reviews and figured
i would take a chance.
and i am so glad that i did.
they are very good quality and sound great.
you looking for an inexpensive set of earbuds that really sound good look no further.
probably the best earbuds i have ever used.
"good construction, excellent sound, at a reasonable price"
"i was surprised about the quality of these earbuds, these hands down sound better than skullcandy earbuds, i also like how the cables are reinforced"
and i never thought i needed earbuds like this.
i will definitely buy other ones once the time comes and will buy some for my brothers.
great pair of headphones.
"they have worked perfectly, bass drivers in the earphones are very impressive for the price and the whole design from the 3.5mm jack to the earphones themselves"
feels very sturdy and long-lasting.
time will tell of this obviously
but so far so good and for a very good price.
light and comfortable in my ears.
clear sound and already came with a holder.
amazing product.. very comfortable for the ears.
my ears usually hurt when i wear earphones for long but this one is jus
"what i needed, i dont even realize that am wearing it..."
these come with beautiful bright colors and that's definitely a plus.
these are really nice ear buds for the money.  
sound quality is excellent.
these are really nice ear buds for the money.  
sound quality is excellent.
"great product took it out of the metal container and have not given a second thought, works great.  "
would buy again
these are the best earbuds i've ever had.
"they're perfect, do what they say, and very comfortable."
these are the only brand of earbuds
i'll ever need.
i brought the headphones for my wife
and i haven't heard any complaints from her
plus she even letter our son use em he like
the sound is awesome.
they are very comfortable and don't hurt the ears like some do
they're phenominal.
"i've always been really cheap with my earbuds, but these have spoiled me."
"for this price, these earbuds are easily one of, if not the best pair on the market."
the sound is incredible and the foam covers are much more comfy in the ear.
"if your looking for some great budget headphones, these are a great choice."
rcvd them 9/11/19 and they stopped working 11/1/19.
so i expected them to work a bit longer.
";(  lol, guess i stick with the cheaper ones"
cause the last longer.
i got these to try for the first time — just to try something new.
"for the price, they’re quite good!"
"very clear music, and not at all cheap sounding."
"i think the bass could use some improvement, but this is more of a nitpick, as it’s still passable."
"again, very good earbuds, especially for those of us on a budget."
would recommend to others.
great product.
the quality of the sound is great!
super comfortable.
love them!
comfortable and durable.
good quality sound.
like them so far and have no complaints for the price.  
sound quality is decent and fits my ears comfortably.
the sound is great but the earbuds fall out no matter which size i use.
ok for watching but will fall out when moving around
"good sound quality, nice packaging and definitely worth the money."
i have had to return two pairs because the volume automatically goes down on my device when i run with them on.  
it is like the volume control is too close to my face and gets triggered by that touch or my sweat.  
"super disappointed because i love the feel of them, etc."
no bass.
scratchy sound quality.
default ear peice cover looks like it was melted.
you get what you pay for.
they're comfortable and the sound is great.
excellent price and product
best headphones ever.
for this price i couldn’t find better.
they sound great.
high quality and the wire is fantastic.
love em
it's a great product for the price.
"good sound, esp when playing on soft/medium volume."
"blasting the music at a high volume does cause sound to decrease in quality a little, but for this price, it's a worthwhile buy."
"good make/quality too, like the notangle wire and quality of the foam itself is good/noise isolating,"
"tens all around for comfort, sound quality and easy on the wallet."
we love the texture of the cord.
the sound quality is very good.
these headphones are amazing.
lightweight and great quality.
highly recommend.
i am very pleased with these earbuds after a week of use.  
the cable seems very strong.  
i expect it to last a long time.
these earbuds were for a gift and the person told me that they were very good quality and didn't have many issues for them.
the only issue being that the plastic that goes in your ear is a little too long.
other than that these earbuds were good.
excellent wired earbuds for the price.
durable wire should hold up well over time.
comes with memory foam ear tips installed and several silicone tips if you would rather use them.  
ludos does a nice job of packaging by providing a soft case and a hard metal tin package to keep everything together.
nice sound good product
good sound quality and nice packaging.
i love the sound and the volume control on the cord.
"the memory foam ear tips were super comfortable, and also other sizes of"
silicone ear tips were included and they were easy to change.
i’m very satisfied with this purchase.
highly recommend!
"the packaging and materials for these earbuds feel and look excellent, and they have a nice sound quality."
"i was replacing a cheap pair which quickly broke, but so far these earbuds feel more durable."
"the price was pretty good for these, and i haven't run into any issues so far."
happy with my purchase!
mic is terrible.
peaople couldn't hear me.

it is very convenient to use and the packaging is very elegant.
it is a good product
i really like these ear phones.  
only problem is aa you can see one of the ear thingies is smashed so it doesn't fit right.  
had to use the replacement thingies.  
can i get a substitute thingy?
good quality sound
"i like these earphones because of the comfortable way they feel in my ears, the way the sound produced from them are so clean and good ."
crisp highs and mid-range but absolutely no bass.
they were good until they broke.
only used them to occasionally listen to music.
then recently the right earbud has gone extremely quiet and is stuck like that.
disappointed
"great headphones, really convenient at the gym!"
i really like the sound quality
excellent sound quality.
inline volume control and pause/play/skip controls work well.
these are amazing!
sound better and more comfortable than my bose earbuds.
the cable is tangle free and has a quality feel.

"so far, these earbuds have lived up to my high standards."
"they are great for the price and if they are as durable as i hope, i will continue to use ludos."
great product
one side stopped working (no sound at all) after 1 month of very light use
bought these for my wife.
she has talked very highly of them since she first put them on.
outstanding product.
i would recommend these to anyone.
i work in landscaping and use these with most equipment effectively damping the outside noise.
amazing product; great sound and super-fast shipping.
"excellent quality head phones, yellow pair perfectly match the nintendo switch lite."
"amazing customer service, fast response."
"they're great, nice sound.  "
very impressed.  
using them when i'm listening to music on my iphone.
best earbuds i've owned.
gel surround is different than all the others and fits way better!
highly recommend!
great earphones to listen to my music on my phone.
son elegantes
sound quality seems very good.  
very comfortable with the memory foam tips.  
so far i like them a lot.
i used to have a similar headphone like this
but i lost it
"and this is similar to my previous one, definatly recommend to others"
good packaging.
the wires are made of a nice durable material.
lightweight and works well with my smartphone.
the sound on these was great
but i’ve only had them for 3 weeks and the right earbud completely stopped working randomly.
most earplugs irritate my ears.  
these are the most comfortable earplugs i have ever owned.
i love these and how they sound big step up from my last in ear headphones
love it
excellent quality for the price.
delivered quickly.
great sound and comfort.
best buds ever !!!!!!!
very nice and clear.
nice sound for the price
great airphones better price
very good quality
very good .
"if you're looking for great headphones at an incredible price, these are what you need.  "
the sound that these guys produce is pretty rich with out being muddy.  
"the fit in my ears are great and unlike other headphones i've used, they stay in well when i put them even when running with these.  "
one thing i specifically liked was the cord has a texture to it which gives it a different more rugged feel that i really like.  
"overall, with all that is offered at the price point i would definitely buy these again."
i just received these today.
have them plugged into my asus fx505du laptop and volume control buttons don't seem to be working.
they sound great and are very comfortable.
just wish i could control the volume.
am i doing something wrong?update:
after determining that these aren't compatible with my laptop (running windows 10 build 1909 with realtek hda audio drivers)
i contacted ludos tech via facebook.
they were very fast to respond and a pleasure to work with.
i was immediately given a full refund!
now that's what i call excellent customer service!!
i highly recommend these earphones.
they are awesome!
sound great and very comfortable!
thanks
ludos tech and
i will definitely keep you in mind for other products i consider purchasing in the future!

i used to have an over-the-ear headset.
"while, i started travelling almost every day, i found it little difficult to carry those in my backpacks every day."
that is when i decided to go for an in-ear headset with microphone.
found this ludos in-ear headset.
bought this based on the ratings and feedback from amazon customers.
i have been using this for the past 1 week
and i have found zero issues so far.
i primarily use this for attending virtual meetings using webex through windows 10 laptop.
"apart from this, i use this in my cell phone to take calls and listening to music."
"on an average, i use this for 5-6 hours a day."
this comes with a small pouch and a metal case.
"so, carrying this in your backpack will not damage the earphones."
the entire cable is around 4 ft. in length.
the entire cable is braided.
"so, it will not break easily (when compared against a cable made of rubber).in"
"the cable, we have three buttons, one for increasing volume, second one for decreasing volume, and the third button to pause/play."
the third button is little trickier to use.
"if you hear music, the third button can be used to pause the music and replay the music."
"but, the same button if you try it in a phone call, the call will get disconnected."
"so, beware of this functionality."
i was hoping to mute the microphone during the call through this third button.
"instead, it will disconnect the call."
"in other words, there is no mute button in this earphone."
you will have use the mute button in your phone app or in your webex app.
would be great if ludos could add a mute button to this.
"if you travel a lot, this would be very handy to you."
"great and clear sound on laptop, only room for improvement is that when making a call on gmail the listener says it sounds a little far away."
"i guess i should try on  pc too, will probably work better."
"very high quality, with software installed automatically."
should have bought 2 while was on sale.
i hope they will go on sale again.
"compact, no need for bulky headphones."
compared these earbuds directly with sopownic.  
all family member (5) listened to their mobile phone via the different  earbuds.  
we listened in different parts of the house and did not share results.
we wrote our opinions down on paper secretly.
"the unanimous winner for tone, comfort and quality of music and spoken word was the ludos."
i just got these and let me tell you i have bought so many earbuds and
these beats all i have bought the sound the bass its amazing
", i honestly loved them it is a very high quality trust"
me
you can't go wrong in buying them
you will like them as much as i do.
got the first pair for my daughter
and i was very impressed with the packaging.  
since it came in multiple colors i ordered a different color for each if my 4 children and myself.  
i love the foam on the earbuds
", they dont hurt my ear after a period of use.  "
these are very well made earphones.  
"hopefully, they don't die quickly like most other earphones (it's been less than a week or so of getting them.  "
kids love them and i love them.
"best headphones i ever had,great sound , good quality ,i really like the quality of the sound ,,good device & very reasonable price ."
"the clarity sounds excellent with memory foam tips, i was amazed when just plugging in on my samsung galaxy s10 plus and listen with spotify, specially with graphic equalizer and dolby atmos enabled."
great product!
i just received these an i am pleasantly surprised how well they sound.
i ordered these earbuds on a whim as i have several others.
i have to say the sound and comfort of these earbuds far exceeds the others!!
would definitely recommend!
the headphones are surprisingly nice for their size and price!
clear sound and fantastic packaging!also
the wires seem to last longer than regular ones due to the special covering.
checking out other products by this company!
these are great earphones.
high quality and very good sound.
i love them.
i have been using them since i bought them
and they are awesome.
i recieved the ear buds within two days.
"i was amazed at the quailty of the them, the sound, noise cancellation, was great.  "
on the second day only one was working.
i still use them even with the one side working.
"earphone received, fine design, fidelity sound, no noise, sound quality is very good, the effect is excellent."
these ear buds are fantastic.
clear sound great acoustically good bass and very comfortable.
plus all the different sized memory foam fits well and are comfortable.
volume control and skip buttons too make these a mist have.
get 2 pair.
sound is very clear and loud.
these earbuds work great and were bought very affordable e and appear to be made of good quality
ear phone is well made.  
sounds good.  
it came in a very well package.  
the cord looks durable and less likely to tangle.  
i think it will last for a while.
"overall it is a great product with very decent sound quality, and comforable to wear, and surprisingly well packaged, definitely a great pair!"
it has a good quality of sounds.
really satisfied with these earbuds
"the ear buds are very light weight, when i used i felt as if there is nothing in my ear."
"the sound quality is very clear, music is very good."
"the bass, noise cancellation is very good in these ear buds."
it comes with a bag which can be put in your pockets while travelling.
i even used it for samsung galaxy s10 for talking.
the voice call is also very good.
"because of the previous purchase, i gave this product a good rating."
this pair is a christmas present.
it fits into a box the size of a sock.
"this product has good sound quality, durable and comfortable to wear."
will buy again!
great earphones!
i love them.
for this price i couldn’t buy better than these.
sound is great.
perfect fit for my ears.
thank you!
"comfortable, the right color i was looking for."
"love the color, the sound is good, and quality is great!"
the earphone looks very fashionable.
wearing the earphone is very comfortable and not easy to drop off.
the sound quality is very good
there are two main reasons i'm posting such a low review.
"because these two things may not seem like much, but there is still no excuse, and they're they never tell you if they do it or not until you test it out for yourself, because no one seems to think these are a big deal."
"one is, they disconnect when you charge them."
there's no reason you shouldn't be able to charge and use them at the same time.
zero reason.
"for things with such high battery life, i guess it's not as big of a deal on these, but still important to mention."
second.
the volume controls its own internal volume instead of your phone volume.
i have no idea why anyone thinks that's a good idea.
"it means if your phone volume is low, then your highest volume when only controlling with the headphones is pretty low as well."
so you can't fully control the volume using only the headphones like you should be able to.
"no one thinks this is a big enough deal to point out whether or not they do it, but there is absolutely no excuse for having such a function."
i can't give them a higher review out of principle.
"this review is for the 2019 version: ""soundcore spirit x 2019 version""."
"i've used the original spirit x and curve, and the 2019 updated versions of both as well."
these 2019 spirit x are a nice upgrade and absolutely worth trying if you're in the market for long battery life bluetooth earbuds.
pros:>23 hours of continuous playback battery life at ~40% volume~1:40 hours to complete a charge time
"0-100%5:00 minutes of charge time gets 1:32 hours of playback.-they fit very snug, they are hard to fall out/remove."
"they are very comfortable- equal to, or more comfortable than the original spirit x/curve."
the ear hooks are very snug and well designed- more comfortable than the 2019 curve for me.
"the fit feels like a pair of stretchy gloves- snug, but not uncomfortable.-finger controls are still easy to feel and use."
little has changed between the 4 models (
curve/spirit x/2019 versions)-the grills over the drivers have been upgraded to a sturdier metal style over typical mesh.-they
seem to be the most sound isolating out of the 4 styles that i've used (curve/spirit x/both 2019 versions).
this could be a pro or con depending on what you want.
"personally i like to hear outside noises in public, but you can pull them out a little or swap tips."
it might be related to the snug fit
"too.-initial sound quality was very impressive, maybe helped by the isolation."
i don't judge bluetooth earbuds on sound quality-
"they all sound more than adequate for portable wireless earbuds, and if i want high quality sound i'll use better wired iems."
cons:-i wish the cable on all of these was
shorter- 16 inches is fine for me.
the extra length is just bulky.-from
"my experience, with my phone"
", the bluetooth range is lessened on the 2019 spirit x + curve, compared to their older counterparts."
maybe 10-30% less distance before i start getting cut-outs.
"this is usually indoors with walls/windows between the phone & earbuds, and other interference from wifi etc."
a lot of the range depends on whether your head/neck is blocking the control piece.
just a tip if you need max range to look for the older models.
those models get ~12 hours of continuous playback
i believe.-the charging port cover still feels fragile (it has a weak feeling rubber hinge like many other devices do).
i'm not sure how this could be changed.-micro usb rather than usb c-
the cable feels a little stiff compared to the 2019 curve.
not too significant.-i can't get the eq presets to change.
"i tried pressing the middle + volume up buttons for 3 seconds, but it doesn't seem to do anything."
maybe i'm doing it wrong
", maybe it's changing &"
"i'm not noticing, maybe it's not changing at all."
"other:-the turn on sounds have changed; from a single beep, to a short chime followed by a voice stating the battery charge."
the voice is very clear.
"sometimes this is nice, sometimes i would prefer to just have them turn on as quickly as possible."
"i can also check battery level through my phone, but some devices don't offer this.-the low battery warning comes on with 40 minutes remaining."
the voice states “battery low” and repeats every 10 minutes until turn off.
this is nicer & less intrusive than the older warnings that repeated every ~4 minutes.-the volume controls work fine with my android phone.
pressing the physical controls on the earbuds changes the volume of the phone.
"i only write this because another review stated the opposite,"
so maybe it varies by device.-the volume
controls work fine with windows 10.
pressing the physical controls on the earbuds changes the volume of windows.-they work with google assistant.
"regarding the surprising battery life:i connected these to a phone & left them playing music on a desk, so maybe they'll get worse battery when there's connection interference, such as in your pocket, when the device is blocked by your neck/head, etc."
"the phone has bluetooth 4.2, and the settings show avrcp 1.4, and aac audio codec at 44.1khzthey were playing at ~38-44% volume, which was a level i found comfortable for indoor listening."
i believe the battery life would decrease at louder volumes.
"i checked at 23:08 and they were still playing, at 23:33 they had shut off."
overall i would recommend buying these.
"they are more comfortable than the 2019 curve, and seem to be the newest model currently available."
"the older models have held up very well to use and abuse, and i believe these will as well."
"here is what an anker support worker told me:""[spirit x vs"
spirit x 2019]- battery life has been upgraded to 18 hours at 80% volume from 12 hours at 60% volume.-
waterproof protection has been upgraded to ip68 dustproof and waterproof from ipx7
waterproof.- added multi-point bluetooth connection.- bass has been boosted and the volume has been increased.
"regarding the difference between th upgrade curve and the new spirit xcurve: 18h battery, ipx7 waterproof bluetooth headphones,"
bluetooth 5.0new spirit
"x: bluetooth headphones with ip68 waterproof protection, sweatguard, thumping bass, 18h playtimethe bass on new spirit"
"x will be heavy than the curve one, this means the upgrade spirit x is better if you use in the gym or work out on the go."
"""*edit-"
the physical controls stopped controlling my android phone's internal volume the other day.
i think it was because i had just disconnected them from the windows 10 computer & connected them to my phone.
"i turned the earbuds off, turned the phone's bluetooth off, re-paired them, and then they began to function again as normal"
(physical buttons controlled the internal volume).
the physical buttons also control the internal windows 10 volume.
just a troubleshooting tip.
10.16.2019 update - apple's latest software update allows the headphones to sync with iphone 11.
excellent sound and great comfort.
i really like this style ear pieces as they are both comfortable and fit securely on your ears.
"anker has another excellent product (albeit with earlier, now resolved, connectivity issues."
anker also contacted me after my earlier review offering to fix my problem (and gave me several options.)
such outstanding customer service!
i opted for patience knowing that apple would resolve its software issue promptly -
i am so glad that i waited.
sound is perfect for 40$. nothing much more i could've asked for.
"bluetooth 5 is so fast, i haven't used bluetooth since like 3/4 years ago."
"connects instantly, and lasts forever."
my only complaint is this stupid cable clips.
thank god they are removable.
"they tend to snag on my long hair, and they are super, super infuriating to mess with to get some wrangling of the cable, which is perfect without them."
"no management really needed, not long enough to get caught on anything."
they are light and not clunky
so they just hangout on your ears
"and you can jump around and dance, shake and shimmy, and"
"all the things!if there were more colors that'd be cool, but to be honest these"
are my favorite bluetooth earbuds.
"the completely wireless ones are just so annoying to me, too small and easy to lose / crush."
[updated]the new updated version of the earbuds work with the iphone 11.i love the configuration options with different sized ear wings and pads.
i had no trouble with the earbuds falling out when running on the treadmill
(i had trouble with most other earbuds
i have tried).having the controls on the wire instead of on the earbud itself
was a little awkward for me.
i had to search for the right buttons to push while running.
the sound is okay.
i got a call and the caller said i sounded clear.
just got these going from a very expensive pair of jbls.
"i did a lot of research on different earbuds, battery life and a high ip rating"
were my big deciding factors.
"i'm at the gym every day and run a lot, so i needed something that would last through a multi hour session and not fall out."
i couldn't find anything with a battery anywhere close to these.
plus the ip rating is as high as you can get.
"they just arrived today, and i'm really pleased."
they work much better for calls and have a better mic than my $100 jbls and the battery has been going all day since i got them.
"i started using them at noon out of the box, and ten hours later, they still say they're at 100%."
"i couldn't get more than three hours if i was lucky out of my old ones, so i'm very happy."
"one added bonus is that they also let you use voice assistants, so as a google assistant user, that's a pretty awesome feature."
i wasn't expecting it.
very happy with this product.
"also, i do recommend trying out different combinations of the ear pieces, because that include a lot of different sizes, and while they fit fine at first, swapping out some parts make them now fit perfectly."
great product.
i had the original spirit x
and i can attest that these are a worthy upgrade with even greater convenience.
these are great when my galaxy buds die (which they die way too fast.
spirit x has spoiled me on the battery front lol).
i keep the carrying case attached to the key chain holder on my back pack.
these have gotten me through a lot of commutes so far.
long live the spirit x!!
just want to add a review that says it works with iphone 11 pro.
"after trying out the spirit slims a few years ago, i knew that cheaper bluetooth headphones were now on par with jaybirds and others costing way more, and even more glad to know they were coming from anker, a brand that's been so awesome reputation-wise with the other products i get from them.  "
was frustrated when i got the new iphone 11 pro
"and they would not connect, but tried them again after a recent update and they finally pair."
"knowing that, i finally bought these headphones and they pair flawlessly and sound even better than the slims."
don't know why anker got blame for
the headphones not pairing when it was obviously an apple issue.
"either way, won't be disappointed"
i bought these after reading a review from a tech site.
"for the price, these are fantastic."
they fit my ear wonderfully and the sound is very high quality.
i was looking for good wireless headphones that didn’t cost an arm and a leg (looking at you apple and beats)
that would allow me to lift at the gym without the wire getting tangled.
"after my first gym session with them, i am beyond satisfied."
"they didn’t fall out of my ear, stayed snug but comfortable."
the sweat wasn’t an issue.
"and after 2 hours, the battery indicator on my phone shows it barely dropped in charge.10/10 would recommend."
i was ready for another mediocre pair of headphones that would decay quickly in bluetooth quality and battery life.  
i'm only a couple weeks in
but i can already tell soundcore put some actual effort into this product.  
the case it comes in has every possible accessory you might need.  
the battery seems to be unlimited out of the box
"(i've never even had to go below ""full"" in a day's usage).  "
putting the battery in two pods up by the ears prevents it from swinging around at your neck and causing the earbuds to pull out which reduces wear on the cord and makes them much more functional.  
"the ear loop is simple, comfortable, and effective.  "
i have to wear them all day before i feel even a small amount of discomfort.  
the bluetooth seems to connect instantaneously compared to the last brand i had.  
every single thing about this product seems to be head and shoulders above any other headphone for a similar price.
"this review is for the 2019 version: ""soundcore spirit x 2019 version""."
"i've used the original spirit x and curve, and the 2019 updated versions of both as well."
these 2019 spirit x are a nice upgrade and absolutely worth trying if you're in the market for long battery life bluetooth earbuds.
pros:>23 hours of continuous playback battery life at ~40% volume~1:40 hours to complete a charge time
"0-100%5:00 minutes of charge time gets 1:32 hours of playback.-they fit very snug, they are hard to fall out/remove."
"they are very comfortable- equal to, or more comfortable than the original spirit x/curve."
the ear hooks are very snug and well designed- more comfortable than the 2019 curve for me.
"the fit feels like a pair of stretchy gloves- snug, but not uncomfortable.-finger controls are still easy to feel and use."
little has changed between the 4 models (
curve/spirit x/2019 versions)-the grills over the drivers have been upgraded to a sturdier metal style over typical mesh.-they
seem to be the most sound isolating out of the 4 styles that i've used (curve/spirit x/both 2019 versions).
this could be a pro or con depending on what you want.
"personally i like to hear outside noises in public, but you can pull them out a little or swap tips."
it might be related to the snug fit
"too.-initial sound quality was very impressive, maybe helped by the isolation."
i don't judge bluetooth earbuds on sound quality-
"they all sound more than adequate for portable wireless earbuds, and if i want high quality sound i'll use better wired iems."
cons:-i wish the cable on all of these was
shorter- 16 inches is fine for me.
the extra length is just bulky.-from
"my experience, with my phone"
", the bluetooth range is lessened on the 2019 spirit x + curve, compared to their older counterparts."
maybe 10-30% less distance before i start getting cut-outs.
"this is usually indoors with walls/windows between the phone & earbuds, and other interference from wifi etc."
a lot of the range depends on whether your head/neck is blocking the control piece.
just a tip if you need max range to look for the older models.
those models get ~12 hours of continuous playback
i believe.-the charging port cover still feels fragile (it has a weak feeling rubber hinge like many other devices do).
i'm not sure how this could be changed.-micro usb rather than usb c-
the cable feels a little stiff compared to the 2019 curve.
not too significant.-i can't get the eq presets to change.
"i tried pressing the middle + volume up buttons for 3 seconds, but it doesn't seem to do anything."
maybe i'm doing it wrong
", maybe it's changing &"
"i'm not noticing, maybe it's not changing at all."
"other:-the turn on sounds have changed; from a single beep, to a short chime followed by a voice stating the battery charge."
the voice is very clear.
"sometimes this is nice, sometimes i would prefer to just have them turn on as quickly as possible."
"i can also check battery level through my phone, but some devices don't offer this.-the low battery warning comes on with 40 minutes remaining."
the voice states “battery low” and repeats every 10 minutes until turn off.
this is nicer & less intrusive than the older warnings that repeated every ~4 minutes.-the volume controls work fine with my android phone.
pressing the physical controls on the earbuds changes the volume of the phone.
"i only write this because another review stated the opposite,"
so maybe it varies by device.-the volume
controls work fine with windows 10.
pressing the physical controls on the earbuds changes the volume of windows.-they work with google assistant.
"regarding the surprising battery life:i connected these to a phone & left them playing music on a desk, so maybe they'll get worse battery when there's connection interference, such as in your pocket, when the device is blocked by your neck/head, etc."
"the phone has bluetooth 4.2, and the settings show avrcp 1.4, and aac audio codec at 44.1khzthey were playing at ~38-44% volume, which was a level i found comfortable for indoor listening."
i believe the battery life would decrease at louder volumes.
"i checked at 23:08 and they were still playing, at 23:33 they had shut off."
overall i would recommend buying these.
"they are more comfortable than the 2019 curve, and seem to be the newest model currently available."
"the older models have held up very well to use and abuse, and i believe these will as well."
"here is what an anker support worker told me:""[spirit x vs"
spirit x 2019]- battery life has been upgraded to 18 hours at 80% volume from 12 hours at 60% volume.-
waterproof protection has been upgraded to ip68 dustproof and waterproof from ipx7
waterproof.- added multi-point bluetooth connection.- bass has been boosted and the volume has been increased.
"regarding the difference between th upgrade curve and the new spirit xcurve: 18h battery, ipx7 waterproof bluetooth headphones,"
bluetooth 5.0new spirit
"x: bluetooth headphones with ip68 waterproof protection, sweatguard, thumping bass, 18h playtimethe bass on new spirit"
"x will be heavy than the curve one, this means the upgrade spirit x is better if you use in the gym or work out on the go."
"""*edit-"
the physical controls stopped controlling my android phone's internal volume the other day.
i think it was because i had just disconnected them from the windows 10 computer & connected them to my phone.
"i turned the earbuds off, turned the phone's bluetooth off, re-paired them, and then they began to function again as normal"
(physical buttons controlled the internal volume).
the physical buttons also control the internal windows 10 volume.
just a troubleshooting tip.
i really like these headphones.  
they pair up easily to bluetooth.  
good price point.
functions well for the price
"well worth the money, great headphones"
very good fitgood noise isolation
decent sound quality.
comfortable.
great product
for the most part i really love these earbuds.
here are the positives and negatives:
pro:
* good sound quality.
*
"adequately sized, adjustable band."
*
affordable (currently priced $37.99).
*
strong connection.
i have other bluetooth earbuds that don't extend nearly so far or offer as stable a connection.
*
long battery life.
the manufacturers claims you can get up to 18 hours.
"i rarely go a day without charging mine, but i've never come close to running out of juice while using them."
* come to a full charge very quickly.
*
stable and secure while you're wearing them.
"they don't bounce around or fall out of your ears as you're moving, making them a fantastic option for athletic use."
con:
*
the positioning of the control piece is a bit odd.
"because it's on the cord, which is typically wrapped around the back of your neck whenever in use, you have to reach around and try to maneuver it blindly if you want to adjust the volume, change track, etc."
*
"i do find them a bit uncomfortable after extended use, say 90 minutes or longer."
"that said, i do seem to have sensitive ears"
(i can't wear over-the-ear headphones for longer than about 30 mins.
before my ears start getting very sore).
"if this isn't a problem for you, it shouldn't be much of an issue."
"on the whole, i'm very pleased and i would definitely recommended these."
"yes, i'm surprised too."
i really dislike earbuds because i find that anything that requires being shoved into my ear canals are extremely uncomfortable and they always work themselves slowly out.
there are a hand full of earbuds on the market which don't rely on the insertion pressure against one's ear canal for retention and if these were designed that way-
they'd get 5 stars easily.
"aside from requiring the uncomfortable ""cram it down the canal"" installation on your ear, what really surprised my cynical side was the sound."
i'm an audio snob to an extent and that is also a bit of the reason earbuds just have no appeal to me.
these really don't sound like earbuds at all...
"well, with the provision that you have them firmly jammed down your ear canal."
"for me, that's truly uncomfortable-"
but if that style doesn't bother you then this very well might be the perfect earbuds for you!sound quality
"is quite good, with the ability to reproduce low bass that i've honestly never heard come out of ear buds before."
"it's smooth and controlled and not artificially enhanced to the point where it sounds as bad as some of the headphones and buds aimed at the ""gotta have ridiculous bass"" crowd."
"these appear to only deliver what is supposed to be there, but they do claim a special ""bass up"" processing-"
but it is not overbearing.
"it really just makes up for the fact that these are tiny and as such, will naturally have less bass if not addressed properly."
the midrange clarity is excellent and the highs are present without harshness.
"a source which suffers quality issues will stand out, as these tend to accentuate any excess midrange harshness if present in the source music."
"battery life seems great so far and it depends on volume level, so if you are looking for something that delivers on those long battery life claims- consider your volume settings."
pros:
"battery life, sound quality is ridiculously good for this price range, build quality, waterproof."
cons:
require pressure-fit inside ear canal- painful for some people- instead of using the antitragus etc.
"i think that's the only con!conclusion: if you can take in-canal type buds, these sound great, work great and easily compete with ones three or four times the price."
i've tested several soundcore devices and they all rate higher than the price suggests is possible.
i've just got to take one star off for the painful fit because of their choice of design.
i have a hard time finding in ear headphones that actually stay in my ears.
this has so many different sizes that there is no way it won't fit.
the sound is amazing!
the bass and treble are all well supported.
this also has the bonus of noise cancelling basically anything going on around you.
the bluetooth has impressive range.
"i was able to leave my phone on the counter and walk outside, shut the sliding door, and walk into the backyard without losing the connection."
so this is great for me if i want to clean around the house and not have to carry my phone in my pocket.
overall i highly recommend for anyone who wants a pair of cordless headphones!
i have a lot of ear buds in this style.
they are my favorite because they stay in your ear during exercise.
the over ear hoop on these are very soft and don’t irritate my ears.
the inner ear portion came with several different tips to accommodate different sized and shaped ears.
the sound quality is very good.
the battery life seems on par with other brands of the same category.
the cable has a little organizer to adjust how much slack there is between the two buds.
"all in all, they are a very solid set of headphones."
these are built like a tank.
they should last a long time.
they pair easily and work well.
the strap is adjustable but i prefer the one length straps that form to your neck because sometimes i only want one side in.
with this strap if you let one side hang it pulls on the other bud in your ear instead of the strap around your neck.
this also has the clips that go over your ear.
i prefer the buds that just stay in your ear without the extra clip.
these earphones are very secure and sound pretty great.  
the hooks aren't uncomfortable.  
the sound quality (both in terms of listening and the mic) is way above average.  
"while truly wireless are all the rage now, i actually like having a wire, especially for working out because it makes it easy to just have one ear in or leave them hanging around your neck if you need to take them out while doing something.  "
"these are super secure so they wouldn't pop out of your ear, but if they did, you wouldn't lose the one that fell out since it's connected to a wire and to your other ear."
my wife is very pleased with these wireless headphones!
"they come with a convenient storage case, extra pieces, and a charger."
i can’t believe how comfortable these are!
so easy to use too!
"just connect to bluetooth, turn on, and you’re ready to go!"
they also have volume control.
"the only downfall is there is not a lot of bass, but they still sound great."
for the price you can’t go wrong!
these earbuds are pretty awesome if i must so say myself.  
the clarity is good and i don't have to turn them up loud in order to her the beat in the music.  
it was easy to setup.  
ease of using while working out and not have to worry about them getting wet if have pretty intense workout and start to sweat like crazy.  
when i go for a run they are not as cumbersome as my over the ear head phones
they feel very light
and i'm able to keep my attention to were
it needs to be which is on my run and my surroundings.
i walk everyday and these soundcore wireless earphones are perfect when i walk.  
they do not slip out of the ear and they are so comfortable that it seems like you don't have anything in your ear at all.  
easy to set up and use which is always a plus in my book as i am electronic challenged.  
the sound quality if really nice too.  
"the set comes with a lot of accessories consisting of extra ear tip buds, carabiner and travel pouch.  "
the charge lasts a long time too!!
excellent quality and sound.
more bass than the sharper image one i'd been using.
slides on and off easily.
pairs fine with phone and other devices.
"i like that it stays on even when running, working out, etc."
i love these for running
finally a well made product.
customer service was top notch handling my prior purchase.
"i've had these a few weeks now, and they are perfect for my workout use.  "
"i tried a pair of true wireless buds i bought from a crowdfunding campaign, and while they were good in most respects, and i loved the complete lack of wires, they simply could not keep a stable connection between them with all the interference in the gym.  "
"obviously that's not an issue with these, since they connect the the phone wirelessly, but are wired together.  "
"by using the cord tethers, i keep the wire off my shirt to keep it from snagging, and while i obviously notice it, it is much preferable to a wire all the way to the phone."
"the range on these is excellent, to the point that i have walked away from the elliptical multiple times without my phone and gone to do other exercises without even realizing it - at least 60 to 70 feet away in a room with tons of interference, and never lost the connection."
battery life is more than sufficient for my needs.  
"i've used them for an entire week, an hour every morning, and they still register 90-100% battery.  "
i can easily charge weekly
"- i could even charge daily if i had to, but it's nice not to have to bother."
"with the ear hooks, they are obviously very stable, and they're as comfortable as they can be, being pretty flexible.  "
"there's simply no way these will fall out on their own, as the true wireless ones did a few times.  "
"i haven't tried the different earpiece sizes yet, but i need to go a bit larger on one side -"
it is nice
it offers so many sizes.
"i can't speak to sound quality, because i listen to audiobooks and podcasts, and these are plenty clear for that, as are most headphones.  "
"while they don't have active noise cancellation, they seal out external sound"
"well, so i can get plenty of volume without having to turn things all the way up."
i'll start out by saying that i bought these specifically for running.  
i know how difficult it can be to find good wireless running headphones
so i wanted to leave a review for those who are looking for that purpose.  
i'm very impressed with these headphones.  
i was looking at all of the expensive brands and the more reviews i read
", i kept finding reasons not to buy them.  "
the sound quality on these soundcores is surprisingly good for a $40 pair.
decent bass and reasonable highs and lows.  
"don't get me wrong, it's not the best sound i've heard, but i'm just looking for enough to keep me going through my run.  "
"if you're looking for headphones to stream movies with, etc, these type of headphones aren't for you, in my opinion.  "
buy a good pair of cans.  
the fit is comfortable.  
"very lightweight and hardly notice they're there, at times.  "
"battery life is great, as well.  "
i've now worn them for at least 5 hours and
the battery meter just now came down to 90%.  
"all of that being said, i do have a problem with earpieces not sitting in my ear canals properly.  "
"i think that i must have the longest ears with the largest ear canals, because they just slip out a bit"
and i've gotta push them back in every once in a while.
i've tried all three sizes of the rubber tips that they sent and none seem to hold them in place better for me.  
i'm going to next try some foam tips that i got with a previous set of headphones.  
"i wouldn't let this deter you from trying these, from what i've read, they seem to fit well for most others.  "
i hope you've found this review helpful.  
i'll add updates on my findings after some more time.
"pros:- extremely comfortable, i even sleep with these on and they stay on my ears."
sometimes i feel like i'm not eveen wearing anything.
"i think the reason why it's so comfortable is because of the flexible rubbery thing that goes over your ears.- very long battery life, i use these pretty much all day and don't even have to recharge it."
"i can't even remember it ever getting low, and i usually charge it once every 1-2 days-"
"very durable, i feel like it's kind of indestructible the way it's built -"
"i keep it in my pockets all day and throw it around and it doesn't get damaged,"
"again i think because of the rubber thing, which is a genius design"
"imo.- stylish, much more than i'd expected-"
"versatile because of design (much better than truly wireless earphones, which i've tried before)."
you can wear it only on one side comfortably if you want.-
"great sound quality, although i'm not an audiophile."
it sort of sounds like you're listening to live music.
"i've only owned a few headphones in my life, though, and the max i've ever spent was like $45 on a pair.- awesome, discreet charging port-"
a lot of options so that they fit your ears better
"; personally, i had to swap the sizes and found it way more comfortable after."
cons:-
"very minor, but sometimes i find the buttons are a little annoying to use."
"they are a bit stiff, occasionally takes long to respond, somewhat unintuitive?"
"not really something i care about, because the earphones are amazing overall, but if i had to list a con, this would be it."
i really love these headphones.
"i'm shocked by how good they are overall, especially in terms of comfort."
"it's a genius design imo, and compared to a lot of other more popular brands (airpods), it is definitely worth purchasing."
"i would love to comment more in-detail about the sound, but i don't want to mislead real audiophiles out there."
all i can say is that i am completely content with the sound.
i highly recommend these headphones to anyone considering them.
"i initially purchased the older model, but it took too long to arrive, so"
i decided to buy this one
and i'm soo happy i did.
"i've been looking for an all-purpose bluetooth earbuds for a while (for exercising, phone calls, entertainment, etc.)."
"seriously considered samsung galaxy buds, but i saw good amount of mixed reviews as were the exact same cases for all other true bluetooth earbuds."
"true bluetooth earbuds are more expensive, but overall quality is still not there."
i think we're about 1~2 years away from seeing really good products with reasonable prices.
so i decided to buy this.
"i've used about 2 days, and so far it's been working great."
"very comfortable and secure on my ears, which is very important when exercising."
"call quality was pretty decent, however, if you're a music lover, you wouldn't enjoy using this that much."
"if your main purpose is to listen to music of your choice with the convenience of bluetooth, you'd need to spend well over $200 for a sennheiser or a bose."
this product is for someone looking for a good bang for the buck.
"especially if you're planning to wear in your exercise, this would be a pretty strong option."
this is my second pair.
the first which i liked a lot were great.
they had pretty good sound and battery life.
what i liked was they allowed for pairing of two devices
so i could use with either my phone or laptop with out any problem.
"the ""updated/upgraded"" version would not pair with my laptop."
i am running windows 7
"(i know, i know)"
but i researched this further trying to get them to pair and found that this a known issue with windows 7 and others have had the same problem i think they are a good product just not for win 7.
so i had to return them.
"great sound signature and presentation, light weight, perfect sound quality, really balanced and"
very nice bass.
i love it and recommend to every one!
great headphones!
these are built to last and have great sound.
i have been buying anker products for years and they never disappoint!
passive cancellation works well and when you do that properly they sound shockingly good for the price.
"for the price, these are fantastic!  "
they stay put and are not bulky or heavy.
i lost the  original ones that came with my samsung note 9
hed phone
i need them
i also order me a scenes  
replacement kit also 4
my samsung  note 9
i got a freinds  who her new man welll do this four me for free
arrived a day ahead of time and well packaged.
came with everything like the pic.
brand new no leaks and the rehydrotest
"is till 3-2020 ,except that the little bottle on the right is gold cup lubricant suppose to be the best oil and grease for your paintball gun, would buy again"
just right.  
just as described.
good
"when you buy the empire 20oz co2 tank -black knigh ,does it comes with or without the gas?"
nice product
came with everything like the pic.
brand new no leaks and the rehydrotest
"is till 3-2020 ,except that the little bottle on the right is gold cup lubricant suppose to be the best oil and grease for your paintball gun, would buy again"
"if you consider yourself an audiophile, then you'll need to spend more $ on your earbuds.  "
"but if you are looking for a really inexpensive pair of headphones with decent quality, these will do the trick."
these are ok for the money.
but very poorly made.  
the metal on the earbud feels like there is current going through it.
idk how to explain it other than a tingling where it touches my ear like...
maybe loose wiring idk.
update:
the sound is horrible don't waste your money.
great at noise cancellation.
"they fit my ears perfectly, i use the headphones to answer my phone calls , so i don’t have to take my phone out from my pocket, just one touch of a button."
very convenient.
love the cute and unique packaging.
and color is frerfecf for the holiday.
not bad for the price..
horrible noise quality.
randomly started making crackling and the wires started acting funky.
these are defective and a waste of money
buen sonido están
bien para su precio
"used about two whole times before they developed a short,  now only one side works at a time."
they work so well my son took them from me.
i need to order more lol
the sound quality is very good the microphone is fantastic great deal for the money
worked for 2 weeks then the ear bud fell off (not the rubber but the speaker assembly)
complete garbage dont buy was a waist of money.
great at noise cancellation.

great experience and speedy delivery
the sound and quality of these wireless ear buds is outstanding.
they have super clear and loud sound.
the bass on the ear buds is great.
it’s very high and good quality
wireless ear buds for an affordable price.
only one ear pod would work.
we are returning the pods.
could just be a bad pair.
beside that my daughter said she would use them if they both worked.
sounds good but has charging issues.
"very inferior quality sound, microphone is too low"
great product. 
these bluetooth headphones are a perfect mix of things that i want. 
waterproof and truly wireless.
they easily connect to my iphone.
"they effortlessly connect to each other for really good stereo sound,"
so far i am very much enjoying them and look forward to much more use!
the set comes inside a really nice. 
"it was already charged upon arrival, so i could immediately connect and give it a try. "
it took just seconds to set up the bluetooth connection with my iphone.
i love using these for listening to music at the gym.
great earbuds at a great price!!
great for everyday use.
made well.

*update

i am giving this product 5 stars now.
the customer service was tremendous.
i contacted them about the warping in the mousepad and they immediately sent me a new one.
"even better, then sent me an updated one with the mousepad being almost flush with the wood and no warping, which feels great on the wrists!"
it was also thinner
so it was easier to move around with the laptop and mouse on top.
this is definitely a quality product made by folks with quality customer service.
the ventilation works great with the gaming laptops that have a tendency to get hot.
"there is no better lap gaming desk that exists to my knowledge, and i have tried a few."
"very nice, perfect size and shape for a lap gaming desk."
i would give it 5 out of 5 except there are a few things about the desk that i would not even mention if not for the price.
it would be nice if there was a coating over the wood to make it smoother and take out any small rough sanded areas.
you can definitely feel them if you rub your hand over the corners.
i first felt it when it snagged my shirt.
the mouse pad area for the one i purchase also has a small bump/warping in the center it making the surface not completely smooth (photo attached).
it's not really noticeable unless you are moving over that particular area.
"the raised border around the area where the mousepad sits is nice, it keeps your mouse from sliding off the desk, however i wish the area where your wrist sits was a little more comfortable."
it makes your writs sore after a good bit of time gaming.
i would suggest maybe keeping it raised and rounding the edges there
so they are not sharp.
this is an awesome camera.
i've had canon cameras prior to this purchase and always enjoy them.
they are easy to use and take excellent pictures.
"i've only used this camera once, so far, and it was amazing on how the 40x zoom operates.  "
it is best to use a tripod when zooming to the max because it is hard to hold your hands still and get a clear picture.
the accessories that came with this camera are very nice too.
i liked getting the extra battery and 2 tripods.
the carrying case is nice as well.
i thought the case would be cheap
but it is actually very nice.
plus getting the memory card and the cleaning kit were all bonuses.
"i would highly recommend this camera and kit, worth every penny.  "
the red color is great too because it is different than the usual black camera everyone else has.
my family was impressed with this camera as my first pictures were of a graduation and they all commented on how nice this camera was.
i could zoom in to see all the graduates just as if i had binoculars.
this was a joke gift for my brother for christmas.  
he's a bit...
gaseous...
"so we figured he'd enjoy it, which he definitely did.  "
"this is a nice, sturdy, big mug.  "
"if you like a big mug of coffee in the morning, this will give it to you.  "
i find that 11 oz or whatever the standard size is is just not enough to get me going.  
"so, i am always on the lookout for big mugs, for myself and for family members.  "
"this fits the bill, and goes into the dishwasher and the microwave.  "
if your family enjoys toilet humor you will probably enjoy this too.
amazing stand for tablet/laptop with unique features.  
the clippers for holding a tablet is an amazing feature and very easy to use/adjust.  
i mainly use it as a stand to hang my tablet upside down when i am in bed.  
the leg joints all have knobs that lock/
"unlock leg movement, and"
they all have marked angles on the knobs
so it's easy to set both legs to the same configuration.  
the construction is solid and none of the pieces feels flimsy at all.  
"also, i tend to fall asleep when i watch stuff late at night, so i like to hang this stand over the headboard of my bed"
so i have complete free movement
and i don't have to worry about anything if i fall asleep while watching (too many times i've dropped the tablet while falling asleep and have it fall onto my face...
"trust me, not the best feeling when you're about to enter dreamland).  "
oh... and be careful not to get up too fast in the morning and sit up into the tablet/stand.  
xdhighly recommend to anyone who likes using tablets to watch stuff in bed!
i use this speaker along with the track mount on my fishing kayaks frequently.
while i usually keep the volume low to avoid disturbing others the sound is decent at all volume levels.
it's not amazing but has proven to be acceptable after a little tweaking from the equalizer on my phone.
battery life is great and charging is fairly quick.
it uses a 3.5 mm jack/plug with a usb type a type connecter for the power source.
i assume they utilized this over the micro usb for waterproofing properties.
so far the unit has proven to be waterproof.
"while it has not been fully submerged, my paddle drips water on it frequently yet it continues to function properly with no issues."
i do rinse it off well after use in saltwater.
there are a couple of features and flaws that are somewhat anoying.
when using the track mount you must unscrew the speaker from the track mount to remove it.
it is not possible to remove the track mount with the speaker attached.
this only takes a second but you must be careful of cross threading.
over time i'm sure the threads in the base will wear out.
i'll ultimately end up using some type of ram mount that will solve those issues.
another thing to be aware of is the length of the mounting bolt that threads into the base.
there is nothing for the bolt to bottom out on
so it is possible to insert the bolt to the point that it actually comes into contact with the bottom of the internal speaker.
it's not an issue with the supplied track mount when it is installed in a track but is possible when you remove the mount from the boat and thread it back into the speaker for storage due to the extra thread length
gained that was previously taken up by the track.
one feature that i personally find annoying is the voice prompt feature and the inability to turn it off.
"it announces loudly when powered on, off, and when the connection is established via bluetooth."
i would be fine with a simple beep or nothing at all.
it's just my personal preference though.
overall this has proven to be a great speaker.
it is  well constructed with quality materials and seems to be very durable.
it's a great product that provides you with a little bit of company and entertainment during those long solo paddles or when you're using those slow fishing techniques.
this was a great buy.
first class leather and manufacturing.
comfortable and well distributed compartments.
great quality zippers and hardware.
using it every day and loving it.
will definitely buy from this manufacturer again.
attention to detail in manufacturing is obvious in this briefcase.
the handles feel really nice.
i thought that i wasn't going to be a fan of the little piece that snaps the two handles together
but it hasn't bothered me at all.
"i love that i can take off the large strap, though you can just slip it between the two handles if you don't need it."
"i currently use it to haul around: a small laptop, power brick, mouse, full-size notepad, a handful of cables, and some cell phone accessories."
overall this is a high quality leather bag.
this bag should be your baseline when looking for a leather briefcase.
take note that all the zippers are solid metal.
none of those little leather pieces which will tear off over.
i love love love this computer briefcase bag!  
it is exactly what i thought i was getting!  
the advertisement states metal zipper
but as you can see in the advertisements photo it is a plastic zipper with metal hardware
so i already knew it wasn't metal before i purchased.
the color is true to the picture and i am very pleased!
i bought this as part of my husband's father's day gift and i haven't given it to him yet
so i can't comment on how well it works on the phone.
i will say however that when i opened up the package i was extremely pleased!
"we were shopping for a similar item in telluride, co"
and they were $60 plus.
this case is just as nice at a fraction of the cost.
it is real wood and even has a real wood smell which i love.
"i can't wait for my husband to open it, he will be pleased too.*edit*husband loves it!"
fits great on his phone.
looks like the expensive ones we looked at.
he gets a lot of compliments on it.
still extremely pleased.
"i bought this for my hp pavillion 11” laptop, and it fits very well with about a half inch of room on the sides which is enough to allow me to fit the charging cord and mouse in the case with the laptop."
"the pocket is a little tight and not really usable, but i just put the accessories in the main compartment."
i love this color too.
"i’m planning to take my laptop on my next trip, and if there are any issues with the sleeve while traveling, i’ll update this review."
i decided to experiment with coolermaster paste on my e6400 because it's so easy to change if things go wrong
(love these old machines).
"it's got a p9700 cpu, so i knew it wouldn't get too hot..."
it got a bit too hot (87c with a 15min full load).saw that i had this stuff and decided to give it a go...
10 minutes later i had the machine back together
and it won't go over 77c...
fan don't even kick on 'till it's in the 70's.  
the fan actually shut off once during the burn-in.
wow.will buy again if i need it.
good quality product.
on time and as promised.
"this computer case is absolutely beautiful, soft and durable."
i was looking for a very decorative and eye-catching case with a shoulder strap
and i didn't want to spend a ton of money and this case definitely fits all of those criteria.
i would recommend this case to anyone.
i was a little hesitant to buy it at first because it's white
and i was afraid of it getting dirty
but i'm very glad i ended up buying it afterall.

this was worth buying.
i love it.
we purchased this for my wife to replace/augment the marc
"by marc jacobs core pretty elizababy shoulder bag,black,one size diaper bag that we have that she has always loved."
"our two toddlers are growing up, and a full diaper bag is not needed as frequently."
"this smaller backpack does the job now and is much easier to manage on a day to day basis, but still has the look and feel of the diaper bag that she loved."
this is a great stylish bag for any on the go parent.
i ordered this bag for my first semester of college and its awesome.
"i was hesitant at first that the bag would be to small for class, but no."
my 2 in 1 tablet fits comfortably in the bag.
couple of textbooks and journals can also fit fine with the 2 in 1.
"the overall quality of the bag is great, the leather straps giving it that vintage feel and look."
"the material its made up hold pretty great, the zippers work so smoothly!  "
i ordered the slate gray bag & it matches the one in the picture.
i even started to put up pins all over my bag to give it a unique style to make it stand out.
overall i love this bag.
5/5
"excellent item, just as described."
will recommend seller and item
no questions asked
i needed to replace my old rack mount kvm.
i have nowhere to mount a kvm like this where the buttons and leds will be useful.
"but i was able to place the included remote right next to my keyboard, and it cycles through my machines perfectly."
it even works with my old rack mount ps/2 keyboard with trackball using a usb to ps/2 adapter (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b016be8bgi/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00__o00_s01?ie=utf8&psc=1).
we already have a fake tv that we routinely use when we are out of town
and we love that product.  
i wanted the door stop and window alerts for when i travel by myself.  
i had an incident where upon check-in my key card opened a hotel room that was occupied by someone else at the time...
yet assigned to me.  
i like the idea of having the added security of having a door alarm and/or a window alarm (when i am on the ground floor) to use when i check into the hotel at night.
items are small and easy to pack for travel.
these are great headphones for the price.  
they maintain bluetooth connection even when i leave the room.
i had a cover almost exactly like this when i first bought my ipad 4–after all these years it was finally falling apart
so i needed  a new one.  
"this one is just as nice, very sturdy, and  fits my ipad 4 perfectly."
i am extremely happy!
"i ordered this for my new lap top, it has done a great job of protecting and keeping dirt and dust out of the keyboard."
i take it off and wash it once in a while and its good as new.
the vinyl is good quality and has not worn or started peeling after 3 months of use.
this thing was even better than i thought.
4 notches below max volume will get you 12 hr work shift.
little guy has enough bass coming out to surprise you and mids to satisfy.
it's not a harman kardon or an alpine.
"but for the price, i can't see n e thing else beating it."
at least not in in it's price range.
"this tower may cost a little bit, but i think that it is worth it for its sturdiness while it swivels!!!  "
it was fairly easy instructions putting it together & i ended up with a nice sturdy cd/dvd holder:)  
"the only thing was that i ordered the oak color one, but i received the black color one instead...  "
i was debating on which one to get anyways
so i am just as happy with the black one:)  
i did talk with the company about it
and they were willing to exchange it
so that was fine that they offered that:)  
"it sounded like amazon had the ""codes"" reversed on here, but the problem should have been resolved after i spoke with them"
so i don't think that this will be a problem in the future:)
actually i did not end up using it to store my passport drive.
instead i'm using it to store my camera battery chargers.
they and their cables fit and are well protected.
even room for an additional camera battery and a 12 inch microfiber.
this case is awesome!
i use this inexpensive dvd player at my dj gigs several time a month and until i got this case was carrying it around in the original box from like 3 years ago (which was really getting beat up).
this hard-shell case is exactly what i needed.
"fits the player exactly, and has room for all the cables/plugs, plus a handful of dvds."
cant believe i waited this long to get this thing!
one of the best bluetooth waterproof speakers i've ever owned.
great sound.
comes with great mount for my kayak.  
i also use a clip and mount other things to the speaker.  
it's been rained on heavily several times and sound still great.
honestly surprised how wet it's gotten and
when dry sounds great.
i haven't played it in the rain though for some reason.  
battery has not gone dead on me
and i don't charge it every trip.  
only negative i have is that it doesn't have a universal charger.
only one particular charger cord charges it but still 5 star!.
fyi
this review is 2 1/2 months after i've purchased it and still great product!!
my thoughts about this product
: i have a few products from letscom
so far i am very pleased with every product including these over the ear headphones.
if your looking to get a high-end set of noise canceling headphones these are not them.
however you will pay over 10 times the cost.
"these offer a lot for the price, you get a lot of bang for the buck."
the two biggest things you really looking for is sound and comfort.
"sound is pretty good, there is a bass boost button on the headphones that really make a considerable difference."
i put them on and
about 2 hours later i found that i was really enjoying the sound.
as far as comfort goes well
i wore them for 2 hours and there was no discomfort.
the pads are soft over the ears and the head rest
feels good on the top of the head.
"the noise canceling features are pretty good, these tune out most of the sounds around you when turned up to 25% at 50% there pretty loud and you basically tune anything else out."
the mic is excellent
i have made quite a few phone calls and everyone says the sound is amazing.
"the blue tooth is really good, i was able to walk over 60 feet from the phone and the headphones never lost connection."
i was able to put my phone on the charger and walk around the house freely without loosing any sound.
i was able to use these quite a bit and the battery level seemed to be fine.
the company states that you will get about 100 hours of play time.
"something my high end headphones could never do!these also have pause/play, skip forward and back, phone answer, and volume controls."
oh yeah
the bass boost button.
"instructions, a charging cable and headphone jack for direct connection are included as well as a soft case to store and protect the headphones."
i will also state that these have a smaller footprint when folded than my more expensive set of headphones.
overall these are awesome for the price.______________________________________________________________pros:1.
comfort2.
nice sound (better than average)3.
bass boost4.
compact storage5.
they feel solid they are built well6.
"easy functionality, buttons are easy to use and function are learned quickly.7."
these look good!______________________________________________________________cons:1.
i would prefer a hard case to protect these however they are relatively inexpensive so if something was to happen
i would definitely just pick up another set.2.
"when selecting the volume button on the headset there is a clicking sound from the button (not a big deal, there is not much to complain about with these)time will tell on the durability of this product, if this product fails or if there are any issues during my use i will update the review in a follow up and adjust my rating accordingly.______________________________________________________________should you buy it?"
"yes this is very nice, to be honest i will buy more for my parents to take with them for when they travel."
if your looking for an in ear model i purchased their u8 model and those are amazing and have killer bass!______________________________________________________________followup:

install flash player all i have to say is...wow.
"for the price, the quality of these headphones is unexpected and 👌!"
the earmuffs are extremely comfortable and easily paired to my phone.
i’ve only received the product today
so i don’t know about the battery life
but it claims to have 100 hours of play time?!
half of my battle with headphones is making sure i’ve charged them
so they’re ready to use.
many times i’ve started listening to my book
and then i hear the voice telling me i have low battery 😭.
i won’t have to worry about that with these for days!
"for a pair of $25 bluetooth headphones, they're actually very impressive!the headphones have been functioning exactly as intended from the time i got them, charged them up, and proceeded to test them."
all the controls are easily found around the outside of the left ear piece.
"the buttons themself have a significant clicking sound, so you know that you press them when these are on your head."
"the ""bass"" button actually delivers what it is selling."
it does highlight the lower register of sound produced inside the headphones.
"i was a little concerned that these would have trouble fitting on my large head, but the adjustable sides made wearing them possible and, when tuned to the right adjustment, comfortable."
"overall, these are very comfortable headphones."
"i tried laying on my side in bed to see if that would be doable without causing discomfort, and indeed it was surprisingly comfortable."
"given the build quality, i would not expect these soft pads and the faux leather to hold up in the long run, but i'm sure you'll get plenty of use out of these before that's ever an issue."
i have been running these things for hours at a time for the past couple days since i fully charged them.
i don't think the battery is dying anytime soon.
i will need to update once i have a good idea of how many days the charge lasted me.
these headphones are amazing!
i originally bought a pair of $70 cowin headphones and returned them.
the old bluetooth 4.2 connection would go in and out in the cowin.
these letscom however have the newest bluetooth 5.0 and the connection is much more reliable.
"the cowin's would not get all that loud at all for $70 headphones, which i wasn't happy with either."
"these get louder than the cowin's,"
"the battery life with a 1,200 mah battery is far superior to cowin, the bluetooth connection is superior, they are just as comfortable with protein ear pads and protein band and the sound quality is every bit as good as well!"
i am in awe of the quality and value of these headphones!
"i won't be returning these, that's for sure!"
i have owned many many headphones.
these are by far my favorite!
i thought i'd have a hard time replacing the headphones i've used for 6 years but the option to go wireless and the affordable price enticed me to place the order.  
"after a week of using the bluetooth headphones for broadcasting (sound quality is awesome), phone conversations (built in mic), interviews, and everything in between, i definitely recommend them for anyone looking quality...and"
"the plus, they don't break the bank!!"
"battery life is great and in a pinch, you can go wired if needed."

install flash player there are many good features to highlight regarding this phone1)
the phone has a plastic body with a premium finish.
this makes the device extremely lightweight and easy to wear it for
"a long time.2) earpads are very soft, designed for longtime use.3)"
it comes with extremely long battery backup.4)
"upon unboxing, the also give a velvet carry case.5)"
"most importantly, they give a free warranty for 1 full year from the day of purchase upon registering the product."
overall this device meets my expectations and i recommend this product if you don't want to spend over 200$ for headphones.
surprisingly comfortable over a long period of time.
"i compared these to my bose qc ii's, which cost more than ten times as much."
while the bose are on another level (they better be)
this was still absolutely fantastic.
the size is nice for travel; pictured next to a backpack for comparison.
"for all looking for a good buy on a budget, this is your go-to."
"sound quality was really nice, and like i said it works great over a long time."
"like flights, long days at the office, etc etc."
i love these headphones.
i’ve had them now for about 2 months
and i’ve only charged them twice!
i use them every single day during work and on the bus.
i can’t believe how good the battery life is on these.
they are much more durable and sturdy than i expected.
they are very comfortable and they stay on my head well.
"the noise cancellation is good, obviously not studio quality sound"
but if you’re looking for a really good pair of headphones for a great price look no further.
i’m very happy with them
and i would recommend them to others!
i love the bass boosting feature too!
"alrighty, for starters i'd never heard of letscom prior to ordering these headphones, and i'll be honest"
i wasn't expecting too much
"but i my older sony over-ear headphones (which i loved) are falling apart, and i figured what do i have to lose other than $25 if i buy these, so i pulled the trigger and finally purchased them.  "
"the shipping was nice and quick, the packaging of the headphones wasn't anything fancy, but again it's just a box"
and i've been told its whats on the inside that counts anyway.
"once you open up the packaging, you'll find a little carrying bag for the headphones, a micro usb cable, an aux cable, and a users manual."
"again nothing fancy, but what else do you really need, they're headphones."
so now on to the nitty gritty.
"as for what you're paying for, the build quality of the headphones is really good and they also collapse which comes in handy for storage."
"for the price, the sound quality is actually very impressive, and believe it or not, the ""bass"" button isn't gimmicky, it actually bumps with the best of them."
"for the price, and for any price, i have to admit these letscom headphones probably have the longest battery life of any headphones i've personally come across, at this point i think its sorcery."
"the headphones arrived with a good amount of juice in the battery, but i decided to give it a full charge to get an idea of how long the battery would last."
"i used them fairly lightly the first couple days since i have my everyday earbuds that i wear, but i finally put them to use ("
and i'm currently wearing them as i'm writing this) and after 2 hours of straight use the battery is still at 100% somehow.
"to sum it all up, the letscom over-ear headphones are a fantastic buy at its price-point, and a much better overall value  than a lot of its competitors, so if you don't want to break the bank on an overpriced logo but"
"you really want/need a pair of over-ear headphones, do yourself a favor and grab the letscom's..."

"install flash player they are so cool and keep what it promise, volume is good and the bass is incredible as the noise reduction"
"right off the bat, i was a little skeptical of the headphones due to the packaging."
it's very minimal.
it's really just the box.
there's nothing inside to keep the headphones from shifting around inside during shipping.
"however, these proved to be a pretty decent pair of headphones at this price point."
first thing i noticed about the packaging is how small it is.
the headphones are pretty compact since they fold in on themselves and slide right into the storage pouch (sidenote:
mine smelled kind of fishy???).
you'll also find a micro usb cable for charging and a 3.5mm cable for wired use.
warranty info and instructions are found inside the storage pouch with the headphones.
"after pairing up the headphones (which was super easy), i noticed a little button labeled bass that i didn't expect to be there."
"without this bass boost effect on, the bass is nearly unnoticeable."
"with it on, it elevates it to a point where it's there"
but it's not booming.
not the worst i've had but definitely not the best.
these will not rattle your brain.
"in my experience, they never sounded tinny or like they were struggling with any of the music i played through them even at the highest volume."
wearing these was an okay experience.
the headband and earcups are padded leather but the cups aren't all that soft and they're not very deep.
"there isn't a lot of isolation with these but at full blast, you won't be hearing much around you anyway because they do get loud and, even though i haven't had anyone confirm, i'm sure there's a lot of sound bleed."
"overall, they're a good enough pair of headphones if you're looking for an inexpensive pair to commute with or a good looking pair of headphones for your kids to use."
i'm not blown away
but i'm satisfied with this purchase.
"better than i thought, these h10 headphones are awesome!"
simplified; 4 slightly raised hard button layout on the side with an unintrusive flashing blue led at the bottom of the left headset (
"with the bass booster button it's definitely noticeable bass,"
the mids and lows are good and that depends on how your device eq are set!
the battery life is pretty good i've been rocking the headphone since it came in friday
and it's now saturday night still killing my earhole  ).
and priced better than my mpow
but the h10 sounds a lot better!

i'm pleased with my purchase.
i was immediately impressed with the quality and comfort.
"even though these aren't noise cancelation, they do a pretty good job canceling out some background noise."
the bass boost button is a plus.
certain songs go well with it and some without.
great feature.
100 hours of playtime is extremely impressive.
they sink up easy and very user friendly.
they don't compare to the high end models but this is great for the price.
i think they are perfect for audio books and teachings.
that's what i'll be using them most for.
could use a little bit more treble
but overall i'm pleased with these headphones.
give them a try.
they won't hurt your wallet.
that's always a plus.
all i struggle is to find out the headphones with the highest battery life as i am very lazy in charging headphones/earbuds.
often i forget to turn off the power switch or forget my earbuds in my purse (out of the charging case).
this headset is my rescue set as in all these mishaps
i look up to these
and yes they are there working without even charging.
so much so that i have used it for 3-4 hours almost daily since i got these (a week)
"and i haven’t charged it as yet, and still battery shows almost full."
the best part is i don’t have to power off any switch or button.
"after pausing music, it turns off by itself, and i don’t have to bother at all."
"there is a power button which by far i have used to turn it on, and it connects to the bluetooth within seconds."
"another good part is a bass button which turns off and turns on bass for you, and any layman like me can differentiate."
the earbuds are very soft and have never bothered my ears.
just to update that it doesn’t have noise-canceling
"so if that is the reason to purchase, see another model."
but it does manage to keep outside noise less bothering with the bass.
this is best in terms of battery life.
"additionally, there is noise leakage if the volume is very high, so i generally keep it on the medium volume where it doesn’t leak."
overall i would give it 5/5 as it does offer all it mentions and helps me in my bad times when all other headphones/headsets are the low battery because of my lazy nature.
update (one month later):wowww!
its been
one month with over 80 hours of usage
and the battery is
at 40%.i am in shock...
"this hasn't needed a charge since i bought it, and i purposely did not charge it so that i could see how long the battery lasted."
"it's been a month, and although i didn't use them every day, it was well over 80 hours total."
i'm in shock.
buy thesei'd go for it!
i've been searching for a good pair of headphones and these are definitely the ones to go for.
i'm shocked.
i’m pretty much blown away by these $20 headphones.
i have a pair of sony xb950 headphones and these have just as much bass as those and their $150.
my son loves them.
"he has samsung’s akg headphones that you get with the promotion for ordering the note 9, he said these are much better than the akg."
the only issue i see is the headphones do not swivel or give any to conform to your head which leaves a big gap at the back of the ear allowing every bit of extra sound around you to filter in.
over they a solid set of headphones.
i bought these for my 13 year old daughter and she loves them.
she said they sound great.
the audio is very clear and loud.
she also loves the color.
nice pair of headphones for the price
super-duper...
really rocking...
super bass(u can feel vibrations..
when u play bass boosted songs :d )
super battery.
perfect fits.
ultralight weight.
passive noise cancellation good.
you might feel tight on ears...
but after 2-3 days.
it's perfect.
mic working good.  
cushions can be better..but can compromise at this price.
":pit comes in a little soft-touch cover, and the control buttons is a blessing."
cant complaint at this price point.
i am a frequent gym goer so quality tunes and long battery life are paramount to a good work out.
i typically wear ear buds as they have a smaller profile but often times you lose out on sound quality.
i decided to take a plunge and go with the headphones.
i couldn't be happier with the superior sound quality.
i could care less about buds being smaller now.
they even include an audio jack in case the battery runs out!
looking forward to seeing the integrity of the battery life after they are worn for a few months.
well worth the money.
"great sound, comfortable, long battery life."
everything you could ask for.
these headphones are awesome!
the comfort of the headphones are very nice especially when you have them on for a long time.
"like they say "" they fit like a glove."
""" these headphones don't hurt your ears when you have them on."
the sound quality is absolutely awesome.
the sound is not over powering is is well distributed when you listen to the music.
i love the bass because it sounds very good with deep bass.
these headphones are well made and should last for a long time.
the battery lasts 150 hours of listening time which is a plus!!
the microphone on the set is very good because you can listen to you
calls loud & clear.
i recommend them a+.

i was skeptical at first but these headphones are amazing!

i charged these headphones the day i got them
and they still do not require a charge 2 days later.  
i have used them for music and games on my phone for over 3 days!  
highly recommend!!!

great sounding over the ear headphones.  
good distance with not a lot of breakup.  
nice fitting even on my big head.
very good headphones!
"in the first place i would put the durability of the battery, the bluetooth 5 is a big advantage too, i can listen music all-around my house without interruption, in the third place for me"
"is the comfort, for 2-3 hours i don't feel discomfort."
the bass button is very handy if you're listening to a podcast.
i am blown away for how amazing the battery life and audio quality is.
they fit me as well as my friends very well and they are stylish.
would recommend
and yes i am a real person.
⭐
⭐⭐⭐⭐
"let's put it this way, if you blindfold me and have me wear and listen to it, i would have guessed that this is an expensive, branded headphone."
"boy, this headphone blew me away!"
i can't believe the price is only under $35.
the sound is really good and the bass is solid!
i love the bass boost button!
the cushion on the earmuffs and under the arch is soft and comfortable.
"for the battery life, i've charged it once on the day i received it and haven'tcharge for a week."
"the headphone comes only with a cloth bag, i just wish they had hard shell case."
"nonetheless, i love this headphone!"

my husband loves using these to mow the lawn!
they are awesome.
they fold down for compact storage and have surpassed my expectations.
excellent value for the money.
"i really like these headphones, they are compact, sound great, easy to pair, and have terrific base."
"they come with charging cable, wires to connect, a carrying pouch and a great warranty."
the quality of this product is amazing...from the slick design of the headphones to the sound quality.
"the size of the headphones just fits snugly, the pads are very soft & comfortable."
the sound quality is very high-grade.
the noise cancelling feature is just the icing on the cake.
the bluetooth links right away.
i definitely got more than my money’s worth!!!
"i was looking for an inexpensive wireless pair that i could use with my work laptop, mostly for online courses and such."
but based on near 5-star reviews on 100+
reviewers
i'll admit that i was excitedly expecting to have these do double-duty for enjoying some music as well.
well... that excitement was quickly tempered when i fired up some tunes.
"there's a little bass in there, sure, but that's all there really is."
"the sound is flat and muffled, no highs whatsoever.  "
"maybe most reviewers have never tried a high grade pair before or simply aren't as critical about sound quality?lastly, the fit type."
"unless you have infant-sized ears, these are on-ear, not over."
"important distinction that amazon or the maker simply glossed over and as such, the noise cancellation is so-so."
i am very surprised with these headphones.
especially for the price.
they are very soft around the ear and have excellent noise cancelation.
battery life is crazy as stated in the video review.
they took about an hour to charge from 80% which is fine considering how long they last.
you probably wont have to charge them but once a month.
they feel very sturdy as well.
highly reccomend.
these bluetooth headphones by letscom are fantastic.
the headphones are adjustable so they fit me as well as my young daughter.  
cushions on the ears are soft and comfortable.
the sound quality is terrific and the bass amplifier really works.  
gets me moving on my runs.
bluetooth connection was extremely easy to setup.
love that it came with a  pouch to store the headphones and accessories in order to keep from losing them in my gym bag.
i've been using for quiet a few days and the battery life is long lasting.
these headphones are great for anyone looking to buy quality headphones and not spend a fortune.
i used it right away when i got in the mail.
i got so excited to use it
and i couldn't wait to charge it before using it.
"it was a piece of cake to pair it with my note 8, and my other phone which is a galaxy s7."
"the packaging was great, it came with a pouch bag that fits perfectly."
my first impression was it's a light headphone considering it's size.
the ear cushions are large enough to cover my ears.
i like the way it folds to keep it in my bag.
the sound quality is great too!
"if you want a more powerful feel to the sound, you can turn on the bass."
i use it everyday for hours and it still feels comfortable.
sound is great...
it has a buttin for bass that adds fire to the sound..
noise cancellation is 100%...
this is my goto for intense work out
and i do not need any wire since it's all bluetooth..
i love it

very good sound.
very good noise cancelation.
so soft on the ears and head.
i think u could wear these all day.
"i use this headphone to watching movie, it is foldable so easy to store also good for inflight."
it is adjustable
i can make it fit my head.
"it is soft , so when i wear this headphone feel comfortable."
sounds quality good as well.
no complaints yet.
i bought these for my girlfriend and was very pleasantly surprised!
"they look and feel very professional, have very clean sound quality and feel naturally on the head."
came nicely packed in a bag.
i like price and quality harmony and these headphones are more then that!
i would definitely recommend them!
"sounded great on my phone, but when your computer is connected to other bluetooth devices ie my mouse and keyboard, all you hear is static interference."
i don't have an issue with this setup on my other bluetooth headphones.
when i rec'd these right out of the box they were loose on my head.
"i'm  5'8 42yo female, which i didn't like."
sound quality is very good.
battery life is very good.
i bought these to wear at the gym and mow the lawn
but if i bend over or turn my head too fast
they slip
so i have never done either.
i have used them mostly in bed at night to watch netflix before turning in (so as to not disturb my husband's rest).
today i pulled them out of my drawer and put them on to notice they were very loose.
they had developed a break in the very top.
i put them on anyway to do some dishes
and they broke again closer to the earpiece.
i am currently researching heavy duty/noise canceling/bluetooth headphones/snug fitting to replace these.
at least they were cheap.
update:
customer support reached out to me and has offered to rectify my experience.
never charged.  
never turned on.  
the charging cable is so short that you can't even use it with the headphones on.
the wired audio chord is so short you can't even use it with a phone or laptop
so it is useless.  
i used it once to test sound with the audio chord with my head basically in my laptop as the chord doesn't even reach your ears
and i wasn't impressed with the sound--my cheap phillips head set has better sound.  
waste of money
but it was only $20
so you get what you paid for.  
do not understand the short chords at all.
i like this wireless earbud  very much.  
i have a small ears
so a lot of wireless earbud on the market do not fit my ears and hurt too.
this one have 3 choice of ear tips.  
"the small one not only fit my ears, it also very comfortable.  "
the sound is very clear too.  
i love the wire between both buds
so i don't need to worry that i will drop or loss the earbuds when i am doing outdoor work.
absolutely astounding sound quality.
"simply the best i have ever heard at any price, wired or wireless, period."
they fit fine with the included inner-ear pieces (several sizes included).
pairing is smooth and seamless.
it comes with a premium case good to have.
have flexible material and is soft around the ears.
i love them!!!
"well if you want earbuds with a connecting between then, these things are lightweight, comfortable, easy to pair, and have better volume compared to most wireless earbuds i've tried."
there's a little adjuster with the charging port on the cord that's easy to use.
it doesn't weigh down in your ears and there's multiple sizes of ear pieces included to make the fit perfect.
"i decided to try them vs the wireless ones, and there are definitely positives, but i often like just putting one ear bud in to listen to things while still being able to hear what's going on and that doesn't work with these.  "
"so not ideal for my use, but they are good enough that i'll keep them as a back up pair and or if i ever get back into working out, they would likely be better than most wireless ones."
"good battery life, they fit nicely and connect with no problem."
perfect for workouts and mowing the yard 😂
i like this style because the other bluetooth headphone style where the earbuds are not connected
makes it harder to keep track of them.
amazing earbuds
so confortables
awesome ear buds.
i use them when running.
very comfortable and awesome sound.
"they fit very well, so no worries with having to constantly adjust my earbuds while running."
plus a built-in mic
in case i get a call while out on my runs.
great purchase.
would recommend to anyone.
good sound quality in these headphones.
it’s nice not having to plug into my phone.
comfortable to wear.
"i've noticed that testing some of the in-ear headphones from multiple brands, these are fairly well made, have a magnet to hold each bud together, and have great sound quality for the price."
"the in-ear silicon is a bit on the thinner side, coming from someone who uses their own thicker ones, but these seem alright for most people."
good bluetooth headphone..connects instantly and battery lasts long
the sound quality is great.
easy set up and connecting.
i use while working outside
and it does a good job of blocking a lot of the outside sound out.
great product.
highly recommend.
what's nice about these earbuds is that they are extremely comfortable.  
many workout headphones
"you see like this can often be loose or fall out easily, but not these!  "
the design of the ear clip help the headphones stay secure and safe.  
not to mention a short cable attaching the two earpods together.  
"some may take the chord as a con, however, it's not very long and can easily be thrown around the neck to ensure the safety and security of the earbuds when working out.  "
"now, apparently these are extremely waterproof, however i wouldn't recommend going swimming with them.  "
but the nice feature here is that you can workout in the rain if need be.
the sound quality is really what you probably want to hear about.  
"i currently own a set of airpods and a few other headsets, and in comparison to the nicer end of earbuds in relation to the price, these are not bad at all.  "
"the quality can always improve, however it is often times hard for me to tell the difference between these and my airpods especially when doing cardio.  "
"these are much more noise cancelling than my airpods, which make these nice for going to busy and loud places.  "
i usually wear these if i'm going to sweat a ton or be out in the rain as well
"(airpods don't exactly hold up well under these circumstances).overall, these are some pretty good earbuds for the price.  "
"while they are in the lower to middle price range, you don't sacrifice much quality."
these just arrived today and i am thrilled!
"haven't tested call quality yet, but the media sound is fantastic!"
the case they came in is very good quality and pocket-sized.
i've never seen a set of headphones come with their own carrying case that fit everything you could need along with them-
very cool.
"i have very sensitive ears and earbuds tend to be incredibly painful for me, but i wanted to try a pair with the little ""wings"" to see if they'd put less pressure."
"so far, using the smallest attachments and the wings, they are quite comfortable."
i'll have to update later to see how they hold up with extended use.
great item for a great price!

these are the best little earbuds i've ever had.
"the noise cancelling is excellent, surprisingly much better than when i had my beatsx."
and the sound quality is much better than i expected for the price point.
it takes a little time to try all the sizes for the ear buds and hooks
but it is well worth the effort.
"these are by far the most comfortable earphones i've had, and they also stay in my ears the best too."
they look exactly like the pictures and come in a nice box that could be gifted.
definitely recommend!
these headphone have amazing bass!
"they are very great quality, the case is really nice and you can actually make calls using just the headphones if u have the bluetooth connected to your phone!"
these are awesome
they stay in my ears easily while moving which is a big thing for me because i'm a housekeeper in a airplane refurbishment
and i'm constantly moving and bending and most just fall out of my ears.
also when i cant have them in due to talking to someone they easily hang around my neck and stay with the magnetic earbuds.
i've been using these earbuds for a couple of weeks now
and i'm really impressed.
the sound quality is good
(i'm no audiophile
"so i couldn't compare, but it's perfect for my needs)these earbuds stay in my ears perfectly even when running, and the bluetooth connectivity works great."
very happy about my purchase!
my husband is a runner and he likes the ear buds but was complaining that they always felt like they were falling out.
he likes these much better because he has the security of knowing they aren't going anywhere.  
the quality is great and they have been charged once and have lasted 4 uses.
this is an incredibly impressive set of bluetooth earbuds.
i was particularly impressed with the presentation if i bought this as a gift i think that it would have been wonderfully received.
these are very comfortable and the sound is excellent.
i really like the fit of these!
"most other earbuds i have had for active earbuds would hurt after a while because of teh oddly shaped rubber tip, but this one has a little loop that fits to the shape of my ear well!"
it holds in place while i jog/run
and i like that
i can hold it around my neck with the magnetic backs when im not using them.
i love these bluetooth earbuds.
i have tried several different kinds and these are by far the best out of any of them.
they are very comfortable to wear.
i will never buy any other than these.
the sound is also great.
they are awesome and well worth the price.

install flash player i have a smaller pair of earbuds that are usually work out with
but i have noticed that they fall out pretty often.
"when one falls out, it’s really hard to fine."
i got this pair to work out with so that if it falls out it would be easy to get because it’s connected to the other one.
"i have noticed, though, that they don’t fall out at all!"
besides staying in my ear really well they also have amazing sound quality and the noise cancellation is perfect!
these blue tooth earbuds are great.
they are so comfortable i can't take them off.
i mainly use them when going out for a strole or when working on my computer.
"clear, and have good sound."
they fit perfectly snug.
"i tried the 535's, and i must say these are definitely never crackle at high volume levels."
"i don't have a single regret, and at this price point, that fact speaks for itself."
and battery last quite a bit.
i will get a couple of days out of then since i use them a coiple of hours at a time.

～
"lacks more bass sound, i tested them a little more and i liked their stability as they are inexpensive headphones are not bad"
these are high quality earbuds.
i bought them for daughter
and she said they are extremely comfortable.
we go through a lot of earbuds
and these seem like they will last!
good
the quality of the earphone sound is good and the bluetooth connection is stable.
"this is an excellent pair of in-ear headphones, especially for its price range.  "
"since getting a pair, i've tested the audio quality, volume controls, and play / pause functions, and so far everything works quite well.  "
"these headphones have surprisingly strong bass, as mentioned in the description (""heavy deep bass"").  "
"most earbuds are particularly weak on bass, but these must have been engineered specifically to function well in the low-frequency range.  "
"i didn't attempt a technical analysis, but i found that the provided frequency response graph to be roughly accurate.  "
"other reviewers have compared these to skullcandy headphones, and i think that's definitely a fair comparison, even though these cost much less.  "
"these are stronger in the bass than the treble, and will be especially good if you tend to listen to bass-heavy music or prefer strong bass."
"there are a few extras provided: 5 pairs of alternate ear pieces, a small carrying bag, and a clip that can be attached to the headphones.  "
"the replacement / alternate ear pieces vary in size, so these should work with most ears out-of-the-box.  "
"to get the best sound quality and bass, you definitely need to use the earbuds that fit you the best."
"they have a standard 3.5mm jack (should work with basically all devices), with a relatively small profile.  "
"this means that even if you have a hard phone case without much room around the audio port, you should still be able to plug it in.  "
"the cable is approximately 35 inches from the plug to the neck, or about 52 in from the plug to the earbud.  "
"everything seems to be fairly high quality, and i expect it to last quite awhile.  "
"overall, a great value! :)"
these earbuds are affordable and get the job done.
"also, the cable doesn't tangle in my pockets."
"however, i am writing this review because, when the tip of my earphones broke, i sent an email to the manufacturer (marsno) and they promptly sent me a replacement."
"in the process, i also learned something interesting: the warranties on earphones vary widely."
"i got these marsno m2 to replace a fancier pair of sony mdrxb50ap, which cost twice as much and failed after 3 months."
"however, the marsno have a 1-year manufacturer warranty while sony's ""higher quality"" alternative has a warranty that lasts..."
just 3 months.
"i prefer to buy from companies that stand by their products, so i recommend the marsno m2 as an affordable and decent set of earbuds that gets the job done and is really backed by its manufacturer."
i reviewed the marsno m1
", i still have them, not even a scratch on them, in fact i compared the two myself, for a few hours."
"the m2's are obviously better though the sound is equal, though i find the bass on the m2 a little heavier for some odd reason."
"it has all the functions of the m1's except you can actually manage your volume on the controller, which is really good."
"they also added a curved design, which interesting."
"i think all earphones should be designed like this, because there is a bit of a curve on your ears, so they seal and sit nicely."
"a lot of people don't know this, but you don't jam the earbuds up into your ears, you gently seal the edge of your ears with the edge of the buds, doing this"
makes the sound come out nice and clear...
if you jam them into your ear and it feels like the sound is muffled even slightly
", you either have the wrong size earbuds on it, or they are too far into your ear canal..."
"there are multiple sizes to choose from though the size that comes on them was a little too big for me, i had to use the widest/smallest ones in the extra bag."
"just like the m1's or any other earphones, you can plug these into your xbox one one s, or pc, or phone to use the mic and utilize the great sound, the bass and clarity of sound is comparable to a cheap turtle beach headset, if not better, and i own multiple headsets as it is, and went through dozens of them..."
i know most people would just buy an expensive head set for the pc and consoles
but these earbuds have been working well for me.  
"also, most headsets eventually start to peel at the ear covers over time even the most expensive 60$-100$..."
that always seems to be my problem with headsets.....
"with these m2 ear buds, however, you don't have to worry about them peeling, or falling apart over time, becuase these are completely made of metal!"
"and if your earbuds breaks, you have extras."
i got these because i have been really into falling asleep to music but my boombox was keeping my son
awake(we cosleep).
i was desperate to keep him asleep but still have my music.
a lot of ear buds in the past were just uncomfortable but these come with several buds to fit your ears which i loved.
my ear canals are small and i dont like feeling like i have to jam them in.
these go in with ease and the sound is absolutely amazing!
i can turn them up as loud as i want and my son cant hear them.
they go from 10hz to 20khz so have a good range.
the jack just fits right into my phone
and i can play all my playlists.
they also came with a nice bag to keep them in when not in use and a clip if you want to clip the cord to yourself.
the cord is a nice length too
so you dont pull it out when you move around.
its 120cm total in length.
overall i am very impressed with these headphones!
"they are well made, are extremely comfortable and have excellent sound quality which is exactly what i needed!"
i spent a stupid amount of time searching for a new pair of earphones.
seriously i spent 2+ hours searching and comparing earphones.
tl/dr; buy these earphones.
"they are the best bang for your buck, the durable metal construction is something you might expect on headphones costing x4 as much.  "
the sound is great and their ability to keep out ambient sound is awesome.
volume and song control
a++my previous pair were the jvc hafx5v. these are great earphones and only $8.
"light, comfortable, good sound, fun colors."
the only problem was the durability and lack of controls.  
i stuff my earphones in my pockets a lot
"and i am rough with them, using them almost daily."
the thin cord inevitably gives way and you lose sound in one ear or the other
and you have to do the flippy dance with the cord hoping to regain connection.
this usually happens at about the one year mark.
i figured i would invest about double or even triple that if it meant i wouldn't have to keep re-buying earphones and for the increased upfront cost i was hoping to get an increase in sound quality.
my requirements were:1.
$30 or under2.
volume control3.
"song control, skip song and previous song selection4."
mic for talking on the phone5.
durable construction6.
not too heavy since i wear them 8+ hours a day that fatigues my earthere were
only a few earphones that fit the bill and marsno m2's were one of them.
they also offered a 1 year satisfaction guarantee.
"they are made of metal, they seem durable, and they have all the controls i wanted."
"they are marginally heavier, but not excessive."
"the sound is slightly crisper and cleaner than my jvc's and definitely some more bass, but these are earphones so don't expect anything crazy."
"the construction is clean, simple, and durable."
they fit deeper in your ear canal and block out surrounding noise x10 better than my previous jvc’s.
i don’t have to crank the volume up to drown noise out.
"i love that these are all metal, the cord is thicker and the controls are even housed in a metal casing that is black so that it doesn’t stand out."
"very simple, sleek, minimal look that i appreciate."
the controls alone sold me on them once i used them.
these controls only work on some players keep that in mind.
"previous song - 3 clicks of center buttonskip song - 2 clicks of center buttonboth controls work on the pulsar music playerspotify only recognized  the double clickpandora only pauses songs, no skip or previous song controls"
"recognizedi have yet to try the mic, and i'll see if i can program the controls for spotify or pandora somehow."
i was skeptical about paying $20 for wired headphones but these are worth it.
my family seems to always lose the buds
so we've gone through quite a few different headphones.
i love that these come with several extra buds (in different sizes)
so i shouldn't have to go shopping again.
the sound is awesome.
my daughter has since swiped these from me as she likes these better than her skullcandy headphones.
"i like to fall asleep listening to audiobooks, so i may be more rough on my earbuds than most people."
"these headphones have a weird shape to them, which makes them uncomfortable if you are laying on them, and they only lasted a few months before the right earbud stopped working."
"that said, pretty good for the price."
if not for the shape i would probably buy them again.

updated #2***marsno customer service contacted me after leaving this review and sent a free replacement which has worked perfectly so far.
the fact they resolved this issue quickly and professionally with a quality product earned their 5-star rating.
very happy!
🙂.
"thank you, marsno!-***updated***it's only two days"
"after the return window has closed, and the right earbud has started to fail."
sound is significantly decreased
just in the right side.
"big disappointment.-prosso much more comfortable than apple earbuds, which hurt the crap out of my (apparently tiny) ear canals."
fully compatible with my samsung galaxy s8!
sounds quality is great!
offering a variety of ear tips saved this from being anything less than 4 stars.
concould just be the shape of my ears
"(so might not be a problem for others), but they don't stay in very well."
had to switch a few tips out until i found ones that fit and stayed in (long double-tipped red ones).
the trade off of finding ear tips that worked is that the suction is
a little too much - actually deafens the sound sometimes
so i have to move the buds around until i can hear again.
"overall, excellent for the features and price!"
"as a casual music listener and gamer, i would like to share what i think about this product."
i will be also comparing this product to the previous generation marsno m1.
the product comes with a slide case.
"inside, there is a earphone and a small box containing four things: manual, happy or unhappy survey card, different ear tips with one ear grip pair, and lastly, the manual."
materialthe quality of the earphone lines are plastic and the top head part is metal.
the rubber cable is seems same as m1.
the texture seems more roughened for m2
(maybe is its just my feels).
the metal part is very nice when you put into your ears.
"compare to other brands using plastic, the head metal material so you will fill tucked in and feel the weight in your ears."
soundcompare to m1 earphones:
- bass
: the bass is similar
i don't hear much of difference compare to m1 bass.
the lower end when it gets low it does give you more of a well surrounded howl (in a good way).
i listen to edm or dubstep for gaming.
"the sound is clean, but as i said the bass can get heavy and smudged feeling when there is a lot going on."
- mid:
the mid range is around the same compare to m1.
"there is not much i can say here, mid range for regular earphones is mediocre."
-
high
: this is where the earphone shines compare to the previous version.
i can definitely hear the higher notes clearer and crispier.
the high range is no longer blended out compare to the m1.durabilityi have been using it for a week now and dropped in a few times on different floors.
the cable hasn't been changed.
i think it does have a fair durability
(m1 has been good to me for 1 year).
"however, the metal head does give you scratch if you drop or slide it through a rough surface."
"overall, i do recommend this product for people who doesn't want to spend much money in their earphones."
i think this earphone has been providing me with casual listening and gaming.
"if you are looking for something really sound technical earphones, i do not recommend this."
i do own a audio-technica m50x
(not really earphone but headphone) for listening for music editing and playing.
so this review is a comparison to m1 and not other earphones.
"also since this is in-ear earphones, the noise-canceling of surrounding is fairly good"
(i am not talking about the actual technical process of noise cancelling function).
fyi
- i was recommended and got this product from marsno
and they wanted me to compare this product to the previous m1 as a casual consumer.
"if you have further questions, comment i can try to describe and explain as much as i can,"
but i would not be checking back as much in amazon.
these earbuds are truly unique...but not in a good way.
"they’re unique because the wires are unshielded and whenever they’re connected to your phone and you set it down on a flat surface, the volume increases sharply."
"you can hear the static in the ear buds, as can the caller on the other end of the line."
not good.
seems like a sign of poor design and poor quality.
not worth it.
these earbuds are affordable and get the job done.
"also, the cable doesn't tangle in my pockets."
"however, i am writing this review because, when the tip of my earphones broke, i sent an email to the manufacturer (marsno) and they promptly sent me a replacement."
"in the process, i also learned something interesting: the warranties on earphones vary widely."
"i got these marsno m2 to replace a fancier pair of sony mdrxb50ap, which cost twice as much and failed after 3 months."
"however, the marsno have a 1-year manufacturer warranty while sony's ""higher quality"" alternative has a warranty that lasts..."
just 3 months.
"i prefer to buy from companies that stand by their products, so i recommend the marsno m2 as an affordable and decent set of earbuds that gets the job done and is really backed by its manufacturer."
i freaking love these earphones.
"the pics show some of my favorite features: the angled earpiece so that they are comfortable to wear, the “l” and “r” are on the side instead of the back"
so it is less likely to wear off quickly and the controls that allow you to play/pause and turn the volume up and down.
to begin with the good; the earbuds look nice and i really wish they werent so bad.
also the sound quality on the earbud that works is okay.
"on the other hand, i just got these and not only does the little control button thing not work..."
but it isnt even the same as the one shown in the manual.
"on a much more serious grievance, while the right earbud works fine and works great, the left earbud is thin sounding, not to mention much quieter than the one on the right, causing great dysphoria when listening to anything."
"and when i say much quieter, i mean the output from this earbud is mabye just over half the volume of its counterpart."
take note that this is right out of the box!
"i have not mishandled them, used them for an extended period of time, or anything of the sort."
"this product is far beyond disappointing and if this is what they shill out to anyone who buys them then i would advise you to spend your money on another pair of earbuds or headphones, because this is just sad."
disclaimer:
i received these earphones for free in exchange for my honest review.
"honestly, i'm pretty indifferent about these earbuds."
"sound quality: i haven't ever had very expensive earbuds, but compared to the headphones i own, the sound quality was good, about the same as my headphones!"
"music sounds quite good, movies and videos sound normal."
comfort:
"according to the instructions, these earbuds are supposed to sit much farther in the ear canal than regular earbuds."
"in order for this to work, i had to switch out the medium size ""ear sleeves"" with the smallest size."
"they kind of create a suction in your ear, which is supposed to insulate against sound."
i mostly find this just uncomfortable.
i prefer to wear more 'loosely'.
compatibility:
"i have a moto x4, and the little volume control and play"
/pause buttons do work with it.
i mention this because in the past i've had earbuds and headphones where those buttons don't work.
"aesthetics: i picked out the grey color, and the metal parts are a very nice color."
"similar to the ""space grey"" color of apple products."
"the wire is rubberized, flexible and sturdy."
"the earbuds have a nice weight to them, they don't feel cheap at all."
"overall, they are very nice earbuds, i'm not sure"
"how much use i'll get out of them since bluetooth exists, but they will be a nice back-up."
update:
my kids
and i have enjoyed
these earbuds
so much
that
i purchased a second set (one for each of my kids)disclaimer:  
"i was reimbursed for the purchase of this item for review purposes, but the review content is honest and fair"
":i recently decided to give these earbuds a try because my kids go through wired earbuds ""like candy,"" and i was looking for a product that would give good sound, be comfortable to wear, and would hold up under abuse.  "
the marsno earbuds were a very pleasant surprise for several reasons:
"first, the build quality was much better than i expected, with supple, sturdy wires, solid ""buds,"" and comfortable inserts.  "
i have never been a fan of sticking anything in my ears -
i guess i'm just more sensitive than most people.  
the first thing that impressed me was that these earbuds were actually comfortable to wear ...
most of the time i can't wait to pull earbuds out of my aching ears after only a short time.  
these did not bother me much at all.
"second, the sound was full and clean, without too much treble or bass, and with a crispness that made listening to music enjoyable.  "
"the earbuds have both a volume up/down button, as well as a button for answering or hanging up a call..."
"this was a very pleasant surprise (the ""unexpected extra"") because when i initially ordered the earbuds i did not even realize that they incorporated a microphone to use when making/receiving calls!  "
people i spoke to on the phone
reported that the sound quality on their end was very good.  
"i even used the earbuds to record a few songs on smule, a karaoke app that lets you sing along with other people or by yourself.  "
"the quality of the recordings was great!third, the price was right!  "
"for under twenty bucks, this set of earbuds is a great buy!  "
"it remains to be seen how long they'll last with my kids actively using them (now that i've finished the initial testing), but they seem to be well built and resilient!  "
i will try to report back as time goes by.
highly recommended! ;-)
i had to buy these because the skull candy strum headsets
i had for many years
", finally broke and i tried to purchase them again"
but they no longer manufacturer them
"and i had to find a suitable replacement, since i travel to work using mass transit everyday."
"i found these headsets, read the reviews and thought i give them a try.  "
"all i can say for now is, they don't match up to my strums."
the sound quality is ok
but i feel that my strums had better clarity to the sound.  
"these are still a good pair of headsets for noise cancelling sound around you, so i don't have to hear other sounds around me, except for what im listening too"
but the music sound quality was better on the strums.
"overall, these are passable to use for me"
but i really do miss my other headsets instead.
boy was i shocked when i put these in my ears and listened to beethoven's 5th symphony as conducted by george szell.  
(you should listen to that version for the inner voices!)in
the interest of full disclosure
", i am a juilliard graduate with a bachelors and a masters degree in music.  "
i am a highly critical listener to music.  
"i was offered a pair of headphones that were ""noise cancelling"" and i panned them though i was given them to review.  "
i don't care.
i am honest and will tell you what i think.  
these are fantastic!!!!!!yes
", i am a very critical listener.  "
i own:
bose qc
35iiapple airpods 2nd edition1more triple driver wired earbuds.
"firstly, let me say that wired beats bluetooth hands down.  "
"this is wired, so it gets a leg up on anything else.  "
"what surprised me was that in a side-by-side comparison with the #1 rated consumer reports wired earbuds, it came out better sounding!  "
omg!  
i
don't believe
"it!i am listening, as i stated above, to beethoven's 5th (now, i'm in the second movement.)  "
"dong a side by side comparison, the 1more triple drivers, which got #1 by cr, sounded full but grainy to me.  "
i popped the m2's in and listened to the same section of the first movement and bam!  
clear as
a bell!  
the  bass is deep and appropriately defined.  
the trebles (highs) are clear and ring out.  
in fact?  
the sound the m2's give me remind me of that clear and forward bose sound.  
fantastic.
"in the interest of full disclosure, i was given this pair of earbuds to review, but believe you me"
", i would have totally panned them if they deserved it.  "
i am not easily bought.  
look at my other reviews.  
i totally panned another free set of noise cancelling headphones that were ghastly.  
the seller begged me to up my stars.  
not a chance.  
they were terrible.  
"his reasoning was ""well, you can't compare something at this price point to a bose""."
the marsno m2's prove him wrong.  
you can  compare a relatively inexpensive product to a bose and it comes out veeeery favorable.
would i buy myself a pair for real?  
you bet.  
i can't sing the praises of these earbuds
enough!another point: i called my wife on these and
"she said the call quality was great!i fiddled with the ""pause"" and ""volume up and down key"" ..."
they're fine and work well.  
this is a quality product!
buy it!  
i wouldn't lead you wrong.  
i tell the truth.
i was definitely hoping for more sound isolation though.
"i got these to replace some cheapo ""lightning deal"" ones i had picked up."
"they actually quieted things down much better than these, but sounded dead and muffled."
i actually tried going back to them but couldn't hack the sound quality after getting used to the marsnos.
i use these primarily for motorcycle riding.
that's why it's somewhat of an issue.
they seem well made
and i enjoy their sound a lot.
"i'd give them 5 stars, but i've never had a chance to use any really premium earbuds before."
"my only real cons involve my particular usage, so i can't rate just on that alone."
1. would be lack of noise isolation.
2.
they do stick out of the ear a good bit.
which makes it difficult to keep them in place while  putting on my helmet.
3.
the volume control.
it is not actually a stand alone volume control.
it actually just controls the volume on the phone or other device itself.
"probably great for many people, but like to use a bluetooth receiver because i just don't like dealing with things plugged in to my phone while i'm out and about."
so one of the biggest selling points for me hasn't been of any use.
"i'll make due with these for now, but might keep my eyes open for another set of marsnos with a slimmer profile and perhaps better sound isolation qualities."
the earbuds malfunctioned after a few months even though i took great care not to mangle or pull any of the wires.
"not sure if it was just a defective one, but regardless, it didn't live up to my expectations."
"i go through a lot of headphones, a lot."
"i either lose them, my cat gets ahold of them and destroys them, or one side always goes out."
i've decided to try these headphones because i needed a new pair and didn't want to pay high-end prices for beats brand.  
"i must say, i'm surprisingly impressed with these headphones.  "
"what i love about them is that the chord is super thick, it helps with keeping the headphones longers because thinner chords easily wear and tare faster and can affect the quality whereas the thicker chords are so much better.  "
"the earpieces itself, very strong and durable with very comfortable cushioned earbuds that came with multiple sizes from small to larger.  "
now let's talk about the sound quality.
"very impressed with the sound quality, i've been using them while working out at the gym with the gym already having loud music in the background and with the sounds of those annoyinggym grunters when doing those muscle exercises, and i must say, putting the headphones on"
", i don't hear anything but the music itself.  "
"even before i put the music on from my phone,  the earbuds definitely cancel out the noises in the background to give me a personal sound with only what i want to hear, which is my own music.  "
"and the bass, yup, there is some nice bass in these headphones"
", i listen to house music while working out and you can hear the nice thumping bass sound of the music."
so loud that i feel i'm in a club listening to loud music.  
"and if loud music isn't your thing,  the volume control is very nice with a nice low volume but still able to hear to a nice loud bass pumping sound that makes you wanna fist pump the air at a dance club."
"very pleased with these headphones and another bonus is, it comes with a mini microphone on the chord where you can also talk to your friends and family on the phone without having to remove the headphones.  "
"yup, this is a keeper!"
i got these earphones earlier this morning
and i already have couple of hours on them.
"i have had a different type of earphone with the same brand, m1943 which is about $15."
now the main difference between this and the product which brings this about $2 difference is the sound quality and the finishing of the product.
"these headphones have a mesmerizing finishing, super smooth metallic texture"
just looks fabulous.
another extra feature it brings than his predecessor is that it has volume control too.
i can feel the bass from these which is great for a earphone worth $17.
these are super loud
"but i feel like at max volume, the sound wasn't as much crystal clear but keep it at around 85-90% volume and it still is pretty loud but sounds much better."
i would definitely recommend buying.
great headphones!
"i am always buying new ear bud style headphones, endlessly searching for a pair that stay in my ears."
"traditional iphone, skull candy, none of these  work for me, they’re constantly migrating out of my ear holes when i workout."
"so far, i think these are going to stay!"
"firstly, my ears like weird little angle of the earbud."
"secondly they included 6 sets of rubber thingys, after some testing out i found some very wide ones that keep them snug in my ears."
"sound quality is great, which is a plus, personally i was just looking for headphones that stay put.  "
"i like that it came with a pouch, a velcro strap on the cord (can be removed), as well as a little black clip that can secure the cord to your clothing."
"i’m also loving the little buttons on the cord, you can adjust volume, answer calls, skip songs or pause."
"overall, very impressed."
i’m going to have to purchase more for my family.
i really love these headphones.
they are really well made and not flimsy at all.
they have a great sound.
"if you are listening to music on your smart phone, you can go into sound settings and adjust the type of sound you want based on the type of music you are listening to."
"even though the sound is really nice as is, adjusting the sound in settings can improve it even more based on what you are listening to."
they come well packed in a gift box in case you want to give them as a present or gift.
there are multiple rubber earpieces so you can switch them out for a perfect fit.
they also come with a small clip you can attach to the wire which will attach to your collar or top part of your clothing so you dont lose them.
"all of the accessories come in a small, sturdy bag with a drawstring that is portable and fits easily in a pocket, or purse."
the earpieces fit nicely in my ears and stay put until i take them out.
outside noise is blocked out nicely while using these headphones.
the handsfree buttons enable a user to talk and listen during a phone call so your hands are free to drive or while doing other things where you need your hands to be free.
i recommended these headphones.
they are definitely not like the cheap versions that are available and only last a short time.
"these are made well enough that you can plan on using them for a long time without having to buy another pair which happens often with the cheap, throwaway type."
"i will definitely be buying more of them, especially for gifts to other people."
in today's day and age of wireless headphones there are two main domains where wired headphones shine: 1) sound quality and 2) value.
these headphones hit on both fronts.
i received these headphones for free to review over a month ago and have used these most of the days since.
"as a result of this time, i have a few observations."
the headphones feel like good quality.
they are lightweight but well made and have a sturdy solid feel.
the metal of the earbuds can feel a bit chilly in cooler climates but they quickly warm up in your hand and the heat wicking properties are wonderful during the summer or during exercise.
"additionally, the metal further lends itself to the solid and durable feel of the earbuds."
one area that i think feels a bit less sturdy is the wire itself.
it is very thin and rubber/plastic coated.  
i have no reason to believe this will fail at any point and mine is still in great condition and performs nicely.
"however the wire simply feels less substantial than the rest of the headphones and, in my experience, wires of that gauge and makeup are more prone to failure."
"the plastic has a bit of a ""memory"" so if the headphones are wrapped up for any length of time, when they are unfurled"
they remain a bit twisted and that makes them pull awkwardly.
ive found myself pulling to stretch them a bit and then spinning the wire to straighten it which is not something i'm used to doing with other headphones.
this mostly solves the problem though.
i wish the headphone wire was a tad bit thicker and had a fabric rather than plastic/rubber insulation or coating.
that would decrease tangling and improves function in my opinion.
nonetheless these are minor concerns.
now for the sound.
these headphones do an excellent job of preserving both highs and lows.
it is possible to distinguish between two guitarists playing at the same time in some songs (a good benchmark as some headphones would muddle the two and lose that resolution.)
the music sounds very full and voices sound crisp.
the microphone is a bit less refined and spoken audio on voice calls sounds a bit tinny to the recipient.
"that said, i've never found headphones with crystal clear call capabilities and this is more than adequate."
overall these complaints are minor.
these headphones would still be great at a higher price point but at this affordable price...
these are a steal.
"great sound, great fit (very comfortable and can be worn for long periods."
not falling out.)
comes in nice packaging and has a nice carrying case.
"for the price, these are incredible and i will be keeping an eye out for more products from this company."
a lot of earbuds that i purchase don't make it through the first week i own them.
"either because the cord gets shreaded in my pocket, or the sound quality is too low."
"surprisingly, these earbuds did."
the 3.5mm jack stands up well to being used on my phone that spends almost 10 hours a day stuck in my pocket.
"i also didn't realize it until now, but the jack itself has the same aluminium housing on it that the buds themselves do!"
the cord itself also stands up very well to light tugging and being wound up tightly.
"despite that, the sound quality these earbuds have were the first thing that caught my attention."
the audio was clean and clear from the get go.
i would say even better than the offerings from skullcandy and sony in the $40 range.
these also get pretty loud if you want them to!
the bass boost on them adds a very satisfying kick that a lot of edm and rap music that most other earbuds just don't have.
"they're built very well, sound great, and are cheap to boot."
i'd highly suggest these to anyone looking to have a pair of daily drivers they actually enjoy!
"first, i received this product by the manufacturer to provide a review on this product."
"first, the product is packaged nicely."
"they come with multiple ear tips, so you are guaranteed to find the right tip for your ears."
i was lucky and got a solid seal on the tips that came pre-installed on the l earphones.
the casing of the headphones are made of both metal and plastic.
they feel solidly built.
now for the sound of the earphones themselves.
they are bass heavy.
they are quite similar to skullcandy.
"for me, the quality of everything else is lacking."
they aren’t the most comfortable either.
my ears were screaming for the headphones to be taken out within the first 20 minutes of having them in.
the true highlight of the earphones were the noise isolation.
"once i had them in my ear and they were properly sealed, i couldn’t hear anything other than the music i was listening to."
"overall, for the price you are getting a well built earphone, with solid bass."
"if you are looking for the complete package, i would look elsewhere."
just got these today.
they sound nice and are comfortable.
"i wasn't able to test the phone call functions, but i tested music."
the buttons work for it except for going to the previous song -
it keeps skipping 2 songs when i click it three times instead.
i removed a star for that.
the button faces are raised enough that you can feel that you're on a button without needing to look.
"it is on the right ear, and will be close to your face (probably so the mic picks up easier).there are lots of little details that make me feel good about this purchase."
"they come with a clip, which is handy."
"there is a velcro cable tie that you can leave on them or remove, and removing the cable tie isn't a permanent decision."
they have their own baggie and it feels nice.
the packaging they come in is nice.
there were a lot more ear cushion sizes to pick from than i was expecting.
i wish they had come in a reclosable baggie.
"considering how many other nice details there are, it feels like an oversight rather than"
them just being cheap.
"the included bag has a nice feel to it, but i wish it was just a bit wider or longer."
"the photo has the headphones folded in half four times, which feels like a bit much to me but is the best fit for the bag."
it would be nice to be a bit wider to make it a bit easier to slip them in.
"i would prefer to fold them in hald twice and then in thirds, feels better to me, but the bag isn't quite long enough for it."
"overall, i'm happy, but disappointed that i can't go back to the previous song."
sometimea you just aren't done with a song by the time it is over!

great headphones!
very heavy duty!!!!
love that quality metal.
i use them a lot to listen to ebooks when driving with the kids in the car (hubby is driving) and it’s amazing being able to hear the book and not the road noise or the kids’
every word.
i can actually pay attention to what’s happening in my book.
kiddos used them a few times and really enjoy being able to hear their music and not their brothers 😂.
sound quality is really good.
very clear and static free.
doesn’t sound like you have the bass turned up too much.
"haven’t had a chance to use them in the gym yet, but have used them doing workouts at home."
really recommend these headphones if you work out or ike to enjoy flawless music without disruption.
i use them for falling asleep too.
i put them in with my white noise app and sleep like a dream!!!!!  
they have been dropped a few times (kids and myself) and they withstand the abuse!
great quality!
"after reading the reviews here on amazon, i purchased these headphones, and very glad i did!  "
these are great quality for the price.  
the black and red ones look cool.  
"the sound quality is loud and clear, just like the comments say about the bass.  "
"i am also familiar with skull candy head phones, however i haven't had the best luck with them.  "
"i have tried several pairs, and they have all stopped working.  "
i really like the mic.  
"its easy to change the volume, songs, or answer incoming phone calls, when walking my dog or running on the treadmill.  "
these headphones are compatible with my smartphone and a few other items in my home.  
i use them to listen to music and to watch netflix.  
"these are very comfortable, even if worn for a long period of time."
"update: 4/25/19 - -i hadn't even called customer service about the problems i was having with the new headphones, but they sent me an email saying that they were sorry that they didn't work for me."
they also gave me a full refund and said that i could keep the headphones.
and then they said that they would be looking for something more compatible to my needs.
i can't believe how incredibly generous and thoughtful this seller is!
i raised them from 1 to 4 stars.
"i only gave them 4, instead of 5, because the headphones didn't work."
i'd at least give them 4 1/2stars!
thank you!
i will recommend them to my friends!first review :  
"i'm trying to use these headphones with my jvc-roku tv  and,"
"unfortunately, it will only change the volume via my phone itself and using the tv remote does no good."
my pair from the dollar tree worked better.
"i'm almost legally deaf, so i need to be able to use the tv remote to get a really high volume."
"you have to call for support, instead of email, which is a major pain, but i'll call them and give an updated review."
"so far, not good."
i was skeptical about this product at first
but i did order to try it.
"shipping was fast, it came before the amazon expected arrival date by 3 days!"
the packaging is commendable since it is properly sealed and safe to say it is brand new.
the contents are securely placed in a well arranged and compartmentalized box.
the earphone itself looks durable enough having a bigger diameter wire/cable compared to other phones at this price.
"surprisingly, it has good quality low and high frequency sound."
"noise cancellation is outstanding, it has very good ear fit."
it came with a nice pouch and extra buds( 4 pairs).
"i listened to music and sports broadcasts, it gives clear, crisp and quality sound."
the one thing that i did not see is the remote volume control stated on the description.
the control is too small for ease of use and seem to change the source when pressed instead of volume control ( i probably need to learn how to use it correctly).
"other than that, i am happy with the product and would recommend it."
i probably need to add a review after a couple months to see how durable it is.
"i have used many different types of earbuds seeing what i like best, and i really like these ones."
"i know that wireless earbuds are a huge thing right now and everybody loves them, but wired is still definitely a good way to go."
"the reason being that wired earbuds are cheaper, never need to be recharged, never cut out, and they have easily accessible buttons along the wire."
i really like the feel of these earbuds as they feel very sturdy and comfortable.
the red/black color of them looks pretty slick also.
"the cord is just the right length for me, it reaches my ears well but is not so long that it gets caught on everything."
"i like the positioning of the inline buttons, its right at hands reach and the buttons are easy to press to navigate through your music."
these earbuds also came with six different rubbery earpieces to make sure they will fit your ear which is nice.
pros:
"great sound qualitygreat cord lengthnice colorseasy in-line buttonslots of earpiecessits in my ears nicely, doesn't hurtsturdy designcons:"
no hook earpieces -
i really like those earpieces that hook inside your ear since they fit really well for my ears.
i still rated these five stars because the included earpieces fit nicely
"the sounds is decent for the price you pay, especially the bass."
"all in all, it is a decent pair of earphones."
controls are pretty easy to use.
incoming calls is just pushing the middle button once to answer and push and hold to decline.
"to play music, you play the button once, twice to go to the next track, or three times to go to the previous track."
"to activate the voice control, press and hold the middle button and of course, the top and bottom buttons are to increase and decrease the volume."
"the full metal casing makes it feel more durable and for all the different sized ears in the world, you have 3 sizes of ear tips."
"as far as noise cancellation, it is definitely not near the realm of bose"
so don't expect much in that department.
"best part of the sounds as mentioned before is the bass while the mid-range and highs kind of lacks, but again, for the price you pay, they are actually decent"
"so if you are in a budget, these earphones will do the job."
marsno has done it again!
another quality in-ear headset for a great price.
i purchased the first version m1 they are good but the m2 has even a  more rich bass sound and balanced mids and highs.
i do have an audiophile and
these sound awesome!
"i have many devices and plugged it into my ipad, my iphone, my portable turntable and my laptop."
i have owned many in ear head sets including top brand names and these sound better and for a fraction of the cost!
highly recommended.
i wish i can give marsno a 6-star rating!
definitely buy another pair.
i do travel alot and the m1 sounded good on inflight entertainment.
sound is nicely isolated with clear sound and rich bass.
the mic is clear and the quality of the headset is metal in ear in buds durable and the wiring is thick.
i have had the m1 for a year now and saw that thy have the m2.
buy it you will not be disappointed.
update 2: 5 months in with the second pair and they stopped working.
update:
my headphones gave out pretty quickly after getting them.
the volume in the right earbud became significantly quieter than the left
and i had trouble hearing out of them.
"i contacted the seller about the issue and they stood behind their warranty, sending me a new pair."
they also told me to contact them
should i have any problems with the new pair.
noise cancellation is pretty good and the quality of sound is excellent for the cost.
i've used the new pair and they work just fine.
i'll update if they go out again.
marsno nailed it with this upgrade.
"offsetting the earbuds makes them fit better, sound better, and stay put better than the m1's."
"whatever magic they did, works great."
"seriously (at least for me), the offset makes these some of the most comfortable earbud headphones i've ever tried, and i've tried a lot of 'em."
"because they fit tighter/deeper into the ear canal, they isolate noise better."
"i'm a gimpy old geezer, so i can't comment on how well they may hold up during a vigorous workout, but for traveling in planes, trains, and automobiles they're spot on."
"i've had them (in black) for several months now, and the only thing i'd've wished they'd changed was to also make 'em in red."
so what happened?
"by procrastinating long enough, they make 'em in red!"
a special shout out to marsno for late night family harmony; i watch and listen to my mobile devices after my wife starts her (very loud) nightly snoring.
"the m2's sound is what i'd describe as smooth and clean, and great for general listening, as the sonic isolation is excellent in noisy environments."
m2 earbuds are well designed made to fit right in each ear.
the quality of the sound is amazing.
m2 has good noise cancellation and a powerful bass .
it has the song control button which i always prefer in  head phones.
the call quality is pretty good and the angled design makes it fit comfortably to talk on call while working or simply finishing up the daily chores.
my only concern (although it doesn't bother me much) is that the sound in the right ear bud is slightly higher than the sound in the left.
"overall, great headphones for the price."
i am so happy with this set of ear buds.  
i hate to pay a fortune for earbuds
but when you go to cheap you get what you pay for.  
this is the perfect combo of a good price and excellent quality!  
i love how well it is packaged
and i gave it as a gift to my son.  
they are really easy to use and came with some great extras.  
"there are 5 sets of plastic ear bud covers in different sizes, a clip, and a great little carrying bag."
the cable is nice and long too so if your device is a little ways away from you it will still work.
it has a standard 3.5mm jack
so it should work with most products.  
we used it with our phones and tablets and the sounds quality was excellent.  
works great for music or talking on the phone.
we will be using these a ton!

the first pair had intermittent sound issues with the right earbud straight out of the package.  
"the replacement pair, in service for only a couple of weeks and no rough handling, now have sound issues on the left earbud.  "
"when it works it sounds fine for the price, but so far 0/2 - going to return and look into something else."
update 8-16-19:  
the company went out of
"it's way to make sure i was satisfied with the earbuds, and offered to replace then refund.  "
they even sent a different model after the refund to try.  
"the earbuds are for my son, the ones that came with his samsung phone lasted a very long time.  "
all i want was an inexpensive replacement that is decent and can hold up.  
unfortunately the first two pairs did not meet that expectation.  
"i am hoping the latest will hold up, and will revise the review later."
"i am really hard on earphones, whether over the ear or in the ear, they never last very long.  "
"i've had some super expensive ones, and then those that cost very little.  "
these are my favorites thus far.  
"the sound quality is great, in my opinion.  "
just the right amount of treble and bass.  
"others i've tried are unbalanced and as such, i get frequent headaches.  "
i've used these almost constantly since i got them
and they've really stood up to the battering i tend to give all headphones.  
the earbuds are made of metal covered which makes them pretty much indestructible.  
"yes, they do have the cushions over the metal"
"and yes, they come with various sizes"
so there's something for everyone.  
the earpieces are angled so they fit into the ear much better than most do.  
they stay in better because of this angle.  
"one thing, though - that metal gets cold so it can be a shock when you first insert them..."
lol.  
"as i said, i'm hard on headphones, and i've never had a pair with a mic that didn't stop working in the first week or so.  "
i need to be hands-free when making calls and nothing has worked consistently for me.  
this pair?  
they've worked for every single call i've made!  
i can't use the bluetooth type
- they just aren't comfortable for me
and i can't hear clearly with them.
"if you're like me and don't like the bluetooth or yours keeps falling out or getting lost, then i highly recommend that you try these."
"they have several colors available, come with instructions on getting the perfect fit,, and there is a little drawstring bag to store them in - if you store them at all, that is."
love these.
i've used earphones that have strong base before and these sound close to them.
i love that they give you so many earbuds.
it's all packaged really nicely.
noise reduction is average.
"also due to the stronger base, music will sound a lot smoother and nice however if you use this to watch videos with speaking, you'll need to raise the volume up by a notch."
i also use this to listen to asmr and like most asmr
i usually need to turn the earphones up
"but these, midway volume ("
little less) works great.
i also love the color choices.
i honestly wish i picked the grey color choice
but the red looks nice
so i don't mind too much.
the instructions manual included is clear and easy to understand.
the wire seems sturdy.
"i'm glad it is not a braided cord wire, i've had one before and the cord frayed in random spots and it was annoying."
i hope these will last a while :)
they have a high quality sound like skull candy headphones.
i use it with my livescribe pen to listen to lectures.
"the sound quality is great, and the noise is cancelled out especially when i use the headphones to listen to my class lectures on a livescribe smartpen at starbucks."
there are only two minor problems: the headphones tangle up with my pc charger when i place them in a school bag.
"second, i just lost one of my ear cushion, and i don't know how to get a new set of ear cushions, yet the sound quality is still great."
"however, i decided to purchase a different set of headphones because i like to try different pairs every once a while."
i'm impulsive when it comes to shopping for items.
remeber and  make sure you don't pull or tug on them very hard.
they are perfect for recorded audio notes on my smartpen and listening to itunes on my apple phone.
"i don't know about the negative reviews, but i had these since early january, and they are great."
"for the price, i give a 4 1/2 stars, but i would give it 5 stars if it was constructed in aluminum instead of plastic and the cord was braided in aluminum as well."
perfect otherwise.
these headphones were great in the beginning.
they had a lot of qualities i really liked and found them to be nicer than other headphones i've bought.
"however, within a month of buying and using, a crucial part of the actual ""bud"" has snapped off, making the entire thing unusable."
"i know it was probably a simple manufacturing error, but i am very disappointed."
i bought the m1 headphones a couple of months back and was extremely pleased by the sound and the eye catching appearance
(i bought the gold).
my only complaint was that there was no volume control.
well the m2 has
a volume/pause button high up on the cord!
so far i’ve only used them for music and not calls yet.
but the sound is amazing!
"i listened to a variety of songs on youtube, including classical, christian pop, live performances, disney and mariah carey!"
the balance is perfect
so you get that “concert” sound as if you are in the audience.
the earpieces have been redesigned to stick out a little for comfort.
the m1 earpieces felt fine to me but this new earbud design is comfortable.
they fit in my ears fine
and i have very small ear canals.
the cord is smooth and tangle resistant.
it fits in my smartphone and tablet jacks fine.
i got the red color but wish these came in gold to look more high end.
"but other than that i would highly recommend these, especially if you’ve been searching for a high quality, long lasting pair of headphones for a while."
i still have my m1’s and plan to keep them.
these headphones comes with their own case and several pairs of backup earcaps
so you can’t beat that deal.
these are a really good deal for your money.  
"i own a pair of the m1's as well and those are definitely solid headphones, but these are the real deal in comparison.  "
"i honestly wasn't sure before the purchase if there was going to be a significant improvement in the sound quality; well, i was proven wrong when i plugged them in and started listening away.  "
the bass is deeper than my previous set (which is one of my preferences) and the overall sound quality was more crisp.  
"the m1's have good sound too, but it's a little more muffled"
i think.
a noticeable difference right out of the box was the construction of the headphones.  
the wires are coated with what appears to be a tougher yet smoother coating.  
"the ear pieces themselves fit better than my previous ones too, so i'd have to say they're not likely to fall out of my ear easily.  "
"overall, it's a heavier and more durable pair.  "
"add the improvement in the sound quality, and you've got some really soooolid headphones here.  "
they were definitely worth a shot
:).
i’ve owned a lot of headphones in my life and  nowadays i split my time in between wired and wireless headphones.
i’ve never gotten used to depending on the battery of the wireless headphones .
"i was looking for a pair that had good sound, that was comfortable in ear and that was made to last."
i’ve had these for about 2 weeks now using them everyday a couple of hours a day
and i’m extremely happy with this purchase .
i really don’t believe in the need of paying 150$ for a great product .
i always do my research and read reviews.
i never make a purchase out of impulse .
and this time has been one of those times where doing a little research paid off .
i’m
rough w
my headphones at the gym and work and these things are made to last
i ordered these on a thursday and was told i would receive these on wednesday.
i received these on saturday ahead of schedule.
these headphones include a wire clip to help keep the wire safe.  
3 sizes of ear pieces to make sure you have the right fit.
a soft cloth carrying case
so the earpieces don’t get dirty in your pocket.
the last thing included is a wire binder so that you can keep the cord from getting tangled while in the case.
i listened to a broad variety of music while using these headphones.
i could not believe the quality of sound from these headphones.
the sound from these headphones makes you feel like you are standing in a concert venue.
i am allowed to wear headphones at work
and i was able to test the cord in real life working conditions.
i caught the cord on tables several times while at work.
the cord would pull out of my phone rather than tear or break.
overall i would definitely recommend these to friends and family or anyone who asks me for recommendations on a pair of headphones.
"for the price, these headphones are very high-quality and sound great."
the earphones themselves are comfortable and stay in the ear (aided with the inclusion of different sized buds).
the curvature of the metal design doesn't get in the way and are stylish.
the cable is tangle resistant and includes volume and play
"/pause controls, as well as a built-in microphone."
sound quality is amazing for the price-
"you get great overall sound, and i personally noticed that instrumental and vocal music are exceptional with these compared to other in-ear headphones (perfect for podcasts!)."
"bass is a little muddy, however, but overall the sound quality is excellent."
"besides the headphones themselves, the package includes different sized buds, a rotating cable clip, velcro strap, and even a soft carrying pouch for storage."
"i would argue that it would be hard to find other headphones that rival the crisp audio, metal build quality, and include the extras that you get with the marsno m2 headphones."
solid 4.5/5 stars!
highly recommend.
"pros:-great for instrumental/vocal music-excellent for gaming, especially in situations where sound sensitivity is key (great companion headphones for the nintendo switch!)-comfortable-durable and stylish metal design-included extras and premium packaging make for fantastic headphones for the pricecons:-triple-click to replay a track seems to only work on ios devices, not"
android-bass is a little lackluster-microphone a little scratchy sounding
"i ordered these twice, within one month of the other."
"pros: good sound quality for the price, quite comfy when wearing out in the world."
"cons: will dig into your ears if you sleep on one side with them on, build quality."
"the first pair worked for a month, but within a week, the control buttons slid off so just the open wiring was exposed."
at the end of the month the right earbud stopped sounding.
the second pair works kind of.
it works the sound is still working.
for some reason the right earbud kept falling off but no big deal.
"then about a week ago, the right ear bud started crackling."
i had to fiddle with the jack to get it to sound straight.
"then when it started crackling again my phone would open up some voice thing, my music kept pausing g and playing and skipping songs."
these died literally after opening them after 2 hours.
i don't write reviews often.
because usually what i buy is good.
and the reviews were quite good.
"unfortunately, these earbuds did the same as the betron make a while ago."
they mute after long period of use.
meaning after using them within 2 hour mark.
the left or right will deafen.
"die, or lower than the other."
and it really frustrates me.
sound quality is great.
they are comfortable.
and they work well while sleeping.
"but after long period use, it's like you gotta buy new ones all over again."
so if anyone has experienced this before.
than you will know more about it.
other than that.
these earbuds are good.
the deafening is annoying and really work on that.
i have this device for few weeks by now.
it is very comfortable to wear it.
doesn't not make your ear feel hot after few hours.
the quality of the sound is amazing; very crisp treble with big deep bass.
clean
and i feel amaze with its quality.
the microphone is good enough and very sensitive.
you don't have to hold the microphone close to your mouth to talk.
i asked the person who talk to me how good the quality.
she was surprised too because the price.
it has very clean and less noise
even i am in the middle of nyc noisy street.
"yes, you can buy bose or skullcandy, but it way so expensive."
skullcandy?
i believe this earphone is better than skullcandy.
"if you are looking for good earphone with affordable price, choose this device."
updated review- 3/16/19i received the updated headphones and they are much better quality then before.
so far so good.
they sent me a replacement.
old review
-i can leave my phone on my desk at work and not hardly move and they turn up all on their own.
i like the sound quality for the price.
but having the music blarrrreee in your ear gets rather annoying.
it worsens when i move.2/13/19
i purchased these nov. 13th 2018.
they really have failed even more.
they turned up full blast and now will not even turn down.
garbage worthy at this point.
"i received my headphones two days ago and i really wanted to get a feel for them before writing a review, and this is what i found."
let's start with the packaging; when i opened the mailer that my headphones came in i was pleasantly surprised to find a shrink wrapped box.  
after removing the shrink wrap i slid the outer cover off of the packaging and found the headphones neatly seated in a soft foam insert at the top of the packaging.  
"at the bottom of the package was a small box with the headphones name ""m2"" on it, and in the small box was a super soft carrying bag for the headphones.  "
"there were also 2 different sized tips to change out for the medium ones that came on the headphones, and a clip to attach to the wire and clip to your shirt.  "
"by the time i pulled the headphones out of the foam i was already impressed and thought that the packaging had a really premium feel to it, but then i saw the plastic cover over the 3.5mm connection"
and i knew it was premium.  
most companies will not take the time to design such a nice package for a product under $20 and those companies take the same approach with their products.  
i could tell that the headphones were going to be good before using them just based on the packaging alone.  
after pulling out the headphones i also noticed the velcro strap that was tethered to the wire for keeping the headphones neat when not in use.  
"this was very unexpected but totally great, and i love the fact that the velcro is tethered to the wire because otherwise it would never get any use."
"after using my m2's for a couple days i found the quality of the speakers to be absolutely incredible for something under $20, there was no distortion from too much bass and voices sounded incredibly clear.  "
the microphone does an excellent job at blocking out the white noise around me and my voice was coming though perfectly clear when talking to others on the phone.  
"i used them while playing shadow of the tomb raider on windows 10 with my xbox one controller, and they worked right away once i plugged them into my controller.  "
"the sound was crisp and clear throughout the game, and although i did not use the microphone during the game it did show up in the sound settings as soon as i plugged the headphones into the controller."
"in conclusion; if you need a really good pair of headphones to listen to music, videos, or even to play video games, and you don't have the money to spend on all the really expensive ones that are out there, then you need to get a pair of these.  "
even a plain xbox
"one headset licensed by microsoft costs $10 on amazon, so this is such a better deal.  "
"for $7 more you get to hear in stereo during game play instead of using just one speaker, and these are definitely more premium than an xbox headset because those things break very easily."
"the only issue that i had with mine were the tips; i had to change the tips from the medium (default) ones to the small ones so they would fit better in my ears, but it seemed really hard to get the tips to go onto the headphones.  "
i suppose this is so they make sure when they are on
"they don't come off, but it did take me like 30 seconds to get each one on.  "
other than that these are outstanding and i would recommend them to anyone.
the sound quality on these headphones is great.
first thing i did was plug them into my phone and listened to a few songs on youtube.
i was really impressed.
in my opinion they are better than the headphones that came with my samsung8.
i like that the cord seems very durable compared to others.
there is an attached small velcro strip for keeping them wound together when not in use.
the ear pieces are angled for a better fit in your ears.
left and right are clearly marked.
came with 5 extra different sized ear sleeves.
seriously considering ordering 2 more sets for the grandkids!
"i tested out these earbuds today while mowing the lawn & laying in bed, listening to some podcasts & music i am familiar with how it should sound, and they’re a solid set of headphones for the price."
they’re not the *best
"* sounding pair of headphones i have, but they’re relatively inexpensive & have pretty good bass response"
"(though, that being said, they also sound like they boost the bass frequencies a little bit, and can be a touch muddy in the lower mid frequencies, but this isn’t unsurprising given the price point)."
they also sound a touch weak on the higher frequencies.
"to be clear, though, you usually have to spend much more than this to do significantly better in these areas."
"they were comfortable, lightweight, and look & feel well built."
one area they excelled was noise isolation.
they did a great job at blocking out outside noises...
"the one drawback on this front is that they seemed to relay handling noise more than many earphones (if you bump the cord against something, the noise physically travels up the cord to the earbuds where you hear it)."
"if you’re looking for a decent set of headphones for relatively little cost, these deserve a serious look."
"seems to be built well, looks great but the sound is not there."
very muffled mid range and highs are hardly existent.
it's best described as listening to a stero with the eq turned to zero on most mids and highs but bass level at the normal range.
vocals are muffled out by the lows and distorted mid ranges.
the cheap panasonic earphones for 7$ are superb as far as sound quality.
i give them a extra star for customer service.
they went above and beyond to follow up and see what i did not like about the headphones.
i appreciate that and someone actually reaching out and looking to keep me as a customer.
5 stars for the seller and 4 for the headphones.
"some people like to spend good money on things like headphones, earbuds, sunglasses....etc."
i notice that most of those type items have a big fat logo on them to let everyone know that a lot of money was spent on that particular item.
me?
i like my money to stay in my wallet.
these earbuds are a great buy.
great overall sound clarity.
flashy design and a quality feel that rivals earbuds that are too expensive for my tastes.
the packaging is slick.
they actually come with a frequency response graph and frequency response is key to how speakers sound.
the bigger the spread the better the sound.
i listened to loud music in my youth and played in many rock bands so my ears are a little worn and jaded but these earbuds cut through.
the lows are good the mids are tight and not too brassy.
highs are crisp and clear.
"for under 20 dollars, these are a great set of buds and the cost is not too prohibitive because as we all know, earbuds always get lost, chewed on, broken, dropped in the toilet....."
etc.
"at that price, it's not a big loss."
"it is difficult for me to find anything that fits my small ear canals, and these fit fairly well with the smallest ear pieces.  "
my commute is over an hour each way
and i use headphones at least 5 days a week.  
overall the sound quality wasn't bad for inexpensive headphones and the mic was clear and i was easy to undestand.  
unfortunately over the last two weeks the sound output has gotten much softer.  
then the mic started echoing any time i was on a call.  
then when i was on the phone or listening to music the headphones would drop the call or stop the playback.  
i have had them less than 3 months.
disappointing that they didn't hold up.
the headphones came on a really nice package felt like just the packaging worth over $10
when i opened the box there was everything inside headphones with a headphone bag which is really nice
also they give you extra ear piece in case they get lost or dirty.
the sound quality is superior than any other headphones i have got in past
oh trust me it has noise
cancellation feature
you won't hear anything from outside when you have these bad boys plugged in overall great headphones for a decent price.
the sound on these earphones are unbelievable!
the volume is halfway and i feel like it's booming!
that's a big deal for me.
most of the earphones i get aren't loud enough.
which is perfect for music lovers.
and they really are noise canceling.
they also have a warranty so at least i know i'll be fine if anything happens later on.
"update!!!!one earbud stopped working after almost 4 months, but once i contacted customer support they helped and offered to send me new ones and are just as amazing as my first pair!"
love this company and their products ♥️
"i was a little skeptical about buying yet another pair of headphones,  usually fairly inexpensive ones leave alot to be desired,  but these deliver and then some."
first of all the packaging is awesome.  
"it feels like a lot of care had been put in to make the product, from the cool looking case to the little carry case they give you,"
everything just screams quality
the  bass is awesome.
"i usually listen to my headphones  on full blast and when i listen to these, i can really feel it, and i cant hear anyone else at all."
the call quality i always base off my mom that cannot hear me
", she could hear me crystal clear"
and i could hear her too.
"it has the mic and the controller buttons conveniently placed, and they work well."
"i was not expecting to like these, but they have quickly become my favorite."
i give these a 4-star rating for sound and comfort.  
only 4 stars as they do not play well with smart devices... :
"(but, they are great headphones!  "
wow!  
$14.95 for the sound that i paid $60 for 10 years ago for a pair of denon!well built and comfortable.
"however, a big caution...  with the built-in microphone (terrible quality sound from it) and volume up/down and play/stop buttons, smartphones, and tablets (at least mine and many others) are driven crazy and activate the google assistant without permission. :(  "
not good.i wish i could buy these without the smart features to just listen to the great sound in comfort.
i’ve purchased 3 pairs of these.  
"first off, the sound quality is decent for $15, no real complaints there.  "
"however, this is pretty much the only positive.  "
"after ~3 months of pretty regular use, the metal pieces making up the earbuds started coming apart.  "
"as a result, the wires later came apart from the phones and they became non-functional.  "
"after the first time this happened, i chalked it up to a bad pair.  "
"after the second, i can’t say it was just a fluke."
"these headphones used to be iphone compatible, and i reordered my third pair thinking this would still be the case.  "
"nope, not anymore, even though they’re still including iphone compatibility in their keywords.  "
"from the looks of it, the volume control and microphone aren’t compatible with any devices at all, so they seem to be just be for decoration."
i’ll probably look elsewhere for my next pair of inexpensive headphones
over the years i've worked very hard to find a pair of headphones i really enjoyed.
i need deep bass and find that many headphones promise that but end up not living up to their claims.
"in january, i bought a pair of headphones from this company which were great."
the base and total sound quality was really pleasing.
so i thought i would buy another pair in black this month.
i find out what i received is totally different than what i received in january.
first the sound quality is very different.  
the volume has to be much higher in order for the headphones to produce enough sound in my ear than the old pair.
i switch to the old pair
and  i have to turn down the volume.
"second,  the base is not as strong as the first pair."
i have tried various songs and noticed the difference immediately.
"third, the option of earbuds sizes is more limited."
i have larger ears and used the bigger bud size.
the largest size supplied with the second pair is smaller and not as large as the older pair.
"so although both were labeled the m2, they are different products."
"so the original pair i receved in january is great , but the new pair is mediocre."
i have used earbuds that have ranged in price from $10 to $150
"and i can definitely say that these earbuds rank up with the higher priced earbuds, perhaps outperforming them in some ways."
i have tested the audio quality and the in-line mic and music control.
everything works very well and is intuitive.
i have found that i am able to hear musical aspects of songs that i was unable to hear on other earbuds.
"i have three pairs of earbuds that i use on a regular basis, they are a pair of usb-c earbuds that came with my phone (htc brand), a pair of wireless anker earbuds, and a pair of skullcandy earbuds."
"i will occasionally use a pair of jaybird wireless earbuds, but do not find them particularly comfortable for long-term listening."
these earbuds have quickly become my “go to” earbuds when listening to music while working or doing homework.
"the earbuds do a good job of blocking out background noise, while letting enough sound in to hear when someone needs to talk to me."
"the earbuds come with additional size ear pieces, a velcro tie to keep them untangled, and a carrying bag."
i will most likely be purchasing at least one more set of these for a friend.
i highly recommend these earbuds.
these are great.
i had purchased another set from a competitor and they had too much bass and a bad mic.
then i turn around and get a pair of the marsno m2s and everything is better again.
i use these to play ps4
so here's what i like out these:1)
mic works really well.
i can hear myself in the echo off other player's tvs and it sounds super clear2)
not too much bass.
these earbuds produce a wonderfully equalized sound for video games.
you can get the runble of an explosion and still hear the subtlety of footsteps.3) earbudd are labeled l or r.
"this is a small detail some miss, but for getting directions correct, it's important.4)"
"comfortable fit, light weight, and plenty of replacement covers"
"(although, i did take the memory foam pieces from the other set i purchased and used those on the marsno m2)if you want lightweight, affordable, and high quality earbuds with a quality mic, then you want to buy these."
just got these in the mail today!
"i had decided they would make a great gift for my wife, and after receiving, we tried em out."
"first off, the packaging was impressive for a pair of earbuds so cheap."
"i didn't read up on these before ordering, so"
"i was surprised to see that they came with a baggie, several ear attachment options and a set clamp."
the sound quality was fantastic.
"the noise canceling in these are great, and im definitely glad that i chose these earbuds."
this is a wonderful pair of wired headphones.
"definitely my favorite out of the total sets i have, not just for its looks but for the sound quality, which was so very clear."
the noise cancelling buds fit perfectly and the extra buds made them securely fit in my ears with no issues and without falling out or impeding the sound quality.
"mic and volume buttons work with no issues and make using this with a phone much more convenient, especially with the added clip that allows you to pin the set to your shirt or jacket."
the clip also helps you keep track of the headphones while not in use and reduce tangling.
my experience with these earbuds are alright.
"for a 15 dollar pair, they have a good sound... with a little tweaking."
"right out of the box, these are way too boosted on the base end."
its unbearable to be honest.
"the seal that you do get from the earbuds is good, but that only makes it such that the bass drowns out and muffles nearly every other frequency.  "
"after i went onto my phone and tweaked the eq to essentially eliminate most of the bass frequency, they sounded really really good!"
"they had a clean sound post eq, and i did leave a little bit of bass there to give the sound a little punch."
i did notice a little bit of crackling in the right ear piece though.
"as far as build quality, they're solid."
metal housing for each bud with multiple ear tips.  
the only thing that i didn't like was that its a rubber cable.
"i'd love to see a braided cable on these.overall, they're a really solid pair of earbuds and a recommended buy if you can manually adjust your eq."
i bought these earphones for a very good price on amazon prime day.
i had owned several very expensive earphones before i used these but decided to switch to a cheaper one because i got tired of them breaking on me every few months.  
and having to replace them every few months got very expensive.
"honestly,  i can't tell the difference in sound quality between these and the ones that cost over $100."
"the only thing that feels different to me is that these have a little more weight to them than my last ones,  which i actually prefer."
i feel like they stay in my ears better because of the weight
or maybe it's because of the shape.
"either way,  i am very glad i had purchased these."
"and most importantly, these have lasted longer than any of my other headphones."
i use these daily at my work.  
"sometimes, i have to keep one side of earphones off so i can hear if my phone is ringing because the noise canceling is so good."
i like to use them with the cord organizer i purchased before.
i love how these came with a case where my organizer fits perfectly.  
"overall, i am very happy with the product and the service."
the customer support is better than any other seller i have dealt with before.
i would definitely buy these earphones or any other product from this seller again.
these buds stay in my ears and are comfortable.  
the angled design is really nice.  
"i also appreciate that the box includes instructions that have a frequency response curve, which gives me the opportunity to set up my equalizer accurately."
"on the downside, they have the problem that i've had with every other brand of wired earphones i've tried: sweat runs down the wires and gets into the microphone and buttons.  "
eventually they stop working
"and i'm left with earbuds that have fine sound but no controls, and the microphone is muffled."
"however, i contacted the manufacturer and they immediately sent me a replacement pair at no charge.  "
their customer service is superb!
"i got these for free to review, just to let everyone know."
i can't really give anything on using these for working out as i use earbuds at work for a desk job mostly.
first off is the build.
"i really liked the light weight aluminum, but,"
"big but, i had to get three pair just to get ones that had the ear buds in the right place, cause they were rotated the wrong way."
"once i got the last pair, they were fine."
"the buttons were better on the third pair as well, as they started using flat buttons rather than the long tall buttons."
second was the feel.
"they were light in the ear, and didn't cause any long use weight issues."
"however, the interchangeable tips were not the greatest."
"they were cheap and kinda painful after long use cause they were stiff, but they were good for sound cancellation."
not the  worst i have had though.
lastly the sound.
i feel like these were a little muddy and the bass was really trying to be too forward.
"i listen to a lot of electronic music so bass is kinda needed for a punchy feel, but these did not give that sound in my opinion."
"i tried other genres like pop, rock, etc."
to get a feel of the vocal fidelity and it was still fairly muddy.
"modifying the eq kinda made the sound worse, cause the mid and high range was just not there."
"the noise cancellation was nice, i didn't have to struggle with these to get them to close off, so there really was no pollution.  "
"i really recommend marsno m1943's over these, but give these a shot if you want."
i don't feel these are better than the m1943's.
bonus note:
"the extra tips and clips were nice, but they were all basically unused for me."
i only liked one set and they were the wide open medium tips.
one star.
"they sounded pretty good when i got them, but they're failing already."
the left
ear bud has become much quieter than the right one and the sound quality has dropped.
"additionally the overall build quality is low, the cables are rubbery and cheap feeling, the metal cover on the jack came unglued the first time i pulled it out of a socket, and the silicone ear pieces have sprue around the edges where they didn't come out of the mold properly and are uncomfortable."
update 07/26/19:
the left earbud fell apart (see attached picture).
these headphones stay at my desk at work and have never been carried anywhere or had any real use.
"i am waiting on a replacement pair, and hopefully they will be better."
update to 3 stars 08/06/19
": i received my replacement pair of headphones on 07/28/19, and i have been using them at work for a little more than a week."
so far so good.
"they sound pretty good, the mic is acceptable, the inline controls work and are useful, and most importantly they didn't start falling apart immediately like the first pair."
"if they continue to hold up, then i would say that they are a good value for how much they cost."
customer service was prompt to respond to my initial review and was polite and helpful in my communications with them.
"shipping time to get my replacement pair was a little slow; i confirmed my address with them on 07/17/19 (late in the pm, so credit them a day on ship time), and i received the new pair on 07/28/19.  "
"10 day turn around for replacement is a bit slow, but still more than acceptable in my opinion because of how prompt and helpful the customer service was."
three star rating for now since it's only been a week of use after having to replace the first defective pair.
i'll update my review one way or another depending on how they hold up and perform over the next few months.
update - shortly after i wrote my review
i was contacted by the manufacturer offering to send a replacement pair.
"i’ve been using the new ones for about a month and a half now, and so far, so good."
"while i still can’t attest to the earbuds’ durability, i added a star for the customer support and rapid response."
original review:i had purchased these about two months ago and thought i had found my hg of headphones...
"nice sound quality, good buttons, didn’t tangle excessively and most importantly, actually fit comfortably in my ears."
i liked them so much that i bought 4 more pairs to have as backup because i am that person who is constantly searching for misplaced earbuds and finding them a week later in a jacket pocket.
"trouble began about two weeks ago when people started to complain that there was a crackling sound in the conversation, but we chalked it up to bad connections (apologies to att)."
"then my music just started spontaneously playing, and now phone calls are being disconnected randomly."
"i don’t know if this is a problem with these marsno headphones in general, or this one in particular."
but now i’m concerned about the durability of the other ones that i purchased and wonder if i made a mistake...
i wanted to wait a while before reviewing these to see if anything broke.
i'm not very hard on my headphones on the daily basis and usually only use them when i'm crafting or cleaning.
"the first thing is that the left headphone stopped working the second day, but i gave it a good whack on the wall and it started working again without a problem."
"the metal feels really good in hand, and the entire thing feels well made."
"the audio jack fits snug into my audio port on my phone, which i love because of the type of pocket i use for my phone."
these also come with a generous assortment of silicon ear bud tips.
i bought these earbuds at the beginning of january.
the first pair i got were defective as the wire broke down after a month of delicate care.
"i messaged the company about it, and they were very comprehensive and sent me a replacement which was in fact wonderful as is."
"i received the m1 instead of the m2, and the company sent me a replacement for that."
i am amazed as to how valued customer service is for this company.
they truly stand by their products.
the design of the earbuds is very nice and comfortable.
the curved earpiece makes it easier for the earbuds to stay in my ears which is splendid.
it takes a lot of movement to actually get them to come off on their own.
the all-metal aspect of it makes them sturdy and durable.
"as for the sound quality, i personally love it."
"it is really rich, clear, and"
the earbuds cancel out noise.
i recommend these.
"the ones i got were just defective, and the company handled that exceptionally."
i use ear buds while gaming.
i never loled the over ear type as i wear glasses and the over
ear starts to hurt after a while.
i am always on the look out for newer better ear buds with a mic to keep gaming.
this set fits perfectly.
the sound is amazing for earbuds.
i have bought maybe 30 in the last year and this set beats them all.
"the ear pieces are encased in metal, not plastic."
that is something i like since i have a habit of then falling off the desk and stepping on them with it knowing.
it comes with rubber ear.tios in several sizes for finding the right fit.
"on almost every set of ear buds i have purchased, the mic is placed where the wire splits, putting the mic right on my chest causing other players to hear loud scratching noises from the mic hitting my shirt from even the slightest movements."
"this set places the mic higher up on the right earbud wire, essentially negating that problem."
the wire used to put them all together seems very solid.
i tugged on them a little and felt no stretch.
i didn't do this very hard as i didnt want to break the thin wiring inside.
"i don't suggest you do this yourself as i get products like this to test them, not really use them."
over all i am very pleased with this product and think you will be too.
i ordered a pair of these earbuds and the first set i received had a flaw in that one earbud was louder than the other.
i immediately contacted the seller and right away they sent a replacement unit without asking for the defective pair back.
the new earbuds i got worked perfectly.
nice deep bass response as well as the mids and the highs.
you really can't beat these for the price.
they come with a built in microphone
so you can plug these in your smartphone for conversations.
volume control and track selection or pause button built in.
i would highly recommend these to anyone looking for some good inexpensive earbuds.
they come with a nice carrying bag so you can store them safely.
excellent seller and customer service.
item was stored in a nice neat box.  
comes with 3 size of earbuds and a clip.
the ear piece itself is made of like a metal/alloy.
is has the standard 3.5mm stereo jack and has the volume/play control button.
one thing i like about this earphone is the quality of sound.
it has a strong bass that when you watch an action movie it is like your watching in a cinema.
sound is really good specially the bass.
one thing i don't like is the cable im
not sure it will last long but still going to try.
will update again after a months of use and see how durable the cable is.
"i have my bose for serious exercise and noise reduction, but they do tend to be spendy."
"my stock apple ear buds do the job, but i hate the way they fit as they tend to fall out more easily than other types of in-ear buds."
"this brand has a good fit (not necessarily great) and the sound is a pit tinny, perhaps too much treble?"
the low ranges aren't as well represented.
"however, for this price i can't complain."
they're my knock around pair that i use when out and about or traveling.
i won't cry if something bad happens to them as they're cheap enough to replace without stress.
"i was very excited to open and use these headphones - the packaging is really nice, which made them fun to open."
"they come with a little storage bag,"
various ear bud sizes and a small clip.
sound quality was great!
"however, i did have a problem with the mic on this particular style of headphones when using them with my 2017 macbook pro."
"the mic worked on other devices (pc, android phone), which was odd."
"after contacting the seller, they promptly offered to send me another style that they make."
they shipped very quickly and the new headphones and mic are working.
i would definitely recommend purchasing these.
"i think my issue was a one-off thing, and the customer service was very helpful in making sure i was satisfied and had a working product."
so i have lots of wireless bluetooth headphones and i've been using these ever since i've bought them.
i take them with me when i go out shopping.
i listen to them before i go to sleep.
i wasn't expecting them to be so good.
the quality is up there with high end brands like panasonic.
i have a pair of panasonic and these are just as good and that says a lot.
these have the upper edge because they are built better and they are magnetic or
at least they feel like they are.
very durable.
highly recommended.
buy it and try it for yourself.

i bought these when my backup pair of headphones finally gave up.
i was very happy to feel these for the first time.
they feel very sturdy and the metal is very clean.
the bass in the earphones is deep and powerful - much more so than what i am used to experiencing.
"i typically only listen to podcasts with headphones, but these have given me the courage to start listening to music on the go again."
the control space on the line is comfortable and the buttons are easy to click.
i'm very happy with these budget-friendly headphones and will probably grab another pair in the near future.
i like that this headphones fits comfortably in the ear.
( it came with 3 sets of ear sleeves ; small medium and large)
so you are sure to get your perfect match.  
the cord is definitely uniquely made ( hard to bend).
it is sure to last a long time.
i also like that the cord doesn't get tangled
(i find that really annoying with regular cords).
its so nice to listen to music on it ; with deep bass that you don't really hear on regular headphones.
"and best of all, it came with a life time warrantly!!!"
highly recommended
i'm really enjoying these headphones.
"first, they feel like they fit well in my ear--"
just the regular ear pieces fit me
so i haven't tried the extras yet.
"the angle of the earbuds seems a little different at first, but i like how they sit in my ear."
"second, the sound is terrific."
"i got a few different pairs, some wireless, some better quality with the hook over the ear, some just fairly cheap, and i'd choose these for the best sound.  "
"though i'm no expert at sound quality, i think these are as good as my $40 pair.  "
"third, i love the posh little storage bag they came with."
little details please me.
"fourth, the volume control switch works"
"well, though i haven't used it for a mic yet."
wow😅 these pack bass.
these things pack as much bass as there were
avengers endgame spoilers out a day after its release.
butbut!that's not my favourite thing about these!!
"sure, the sound quality is great, and it looks/"
feels like
"it'll last longer than my earpods, but the best thing about these are the tips they come with."
manufacturers never have earbuds small enough for my ears.
"i usually have to swap them out from other earbuds, but that wears them out bad."
"probably not going to use the pouch they came with, but it was a nice gesture"
"for starters, i'm generally not a fan of in ear headphones personally."
"they normally don't fit my ears because the pads are either too small or too large and the sound quality suffers because of it, but i saw that these earphones had many size pads"
so i took a chance after reading so many other great reviews.
i was not disappointed whatsoever.
i was able to find a set of pads that sealed in my ear perfectly.
the sound profile from these headphones is very balanced.
"the highs are crisp and natural, not screeching like so many others in this price range.."
"the bass does not overwhelm the mids or highs but still is deep, low and natural."
midbass is also not overwhelming.
everything blends nicely.
i would even say that these earphones have very nice imaging also.
"i have owned in ear phones that have costed 5 times the amount that i paid for these, and i would put these up there with those albeit with the added benefit of ear pads that fit my ears."
the cord seems very sturdy and not prone to tangling.
the collar clip is a nice bonus for physical activities.
would definitely recommend!!!!
these are the best earbuds i've ever used!
"they are well made, the cord is a bit thicker than others"
"so i had less problem with them hanging on buttons, tangling, etc."
"they are aluminum, not plastic and they have an angle so that they go with the shape of your ear canal."
they fit so much better than the straight ones!!  
they also come with a carrying bag and assorted sleeve sizes
so they fit you perfectly!  
all this and awesome clarity!
"i know some people prefer over ear headphones, but if you're comfortable with nice, light weight, portable in-ear headphones, these are an excellent choice!"
i'm updating my review and increasing from 1 star to 3.  
"my concerns about the ear buds remain, but i have to say i'm impressed with the customer service.  "
"after posting my review below, i was promptly contacted and provided with a replacement set of ear buds.  "
well done!i wear earbuds on my walk to work everyday.  
"these buds don't seem to have an insulated cord, so you'll hear it rubbing against your clothes.  "
"it's not terrible, but not ideal.  "
the bigger problem is the design --
"the actual earbud, which juts out a bit from the mainbody of the earphone can break off.  "
i keep the headphones in my coat pocket while at work.  
"they're not treated roughly, but in less than two weeks of having these the earbud broke off from the main part of the earbud.  "
terrible design.
i was looking for a replacement set of earbuds.
after reading the reviews i went ahead and took a chance on these.
i am a bit of a sound snob when it comes to earbuds and headsets my hopes were not high.
i dont usually write reviews
but i received these earbuds today
and i had to write one.
these earbuds are amazing!
the sound quality is what was most important to me
and i can tell you it is very very good.
the fact that the build quality is solid and you get some control functionality on top of it for this price is outstanding.
i can't say enough good things about these earbuds.
"these earbuds, at this price point is a major, major win!"
i previously bought the marsno m1's; they had great sound but their design made them uncomfortable over time because their weight tended to dig the hard metal housings into my ears.
"when i saw that marsno was making a set with an ergonomic design, i had to try it."
these m2 headphones have the same great sound quality and good comfort
"too!the response is very good across the entire sound spectrum, but the bass is particularly noteworthy."
"i can hear frequencies down to nearly 20hz, and these headphones can feel like they shake my head!"
that doesn't make them bad for classical music though: i listen to that a lot
and it sounds great.
the strong bass makes videos and movies sound better too.
"due to great clarity, i sometimes even hear new things in music that cheaper headphones or speakers don't reproduce."
"these headphones do not have active noise cancellation, but they do a pretty good job of blocking out any external sounds when inserted, especially with aftermarket memory foam tips."
improvements over the m1:
* much better comfort due to ergonomic shape* volume control as well as
play/
pause buttonareas for improvement:
* volume controls feel cheaper than on the m1; the m1 has a single play/pause button that feels very sturdy but the m2 uses a single piece of plastic to cover all 3 buttons and its in-line control set has less metal in it.
(the one i got differed from the pictures too; it might be an older or newer design.)
*
the m2 uses cloth to cover the speakers to keep junk out; the m1 uses sturdier (but more open) perforated metal disks
*
more eartips would have been nice: the m2 came with 6 sets (s/m/l long and short)
"so i was hoping that the m1 would as well, but it comes only with s/m/l. (not a big deal: replacement tips are cheap and easy to find and you can upgrade to memory foam tips.)notes:"
* comes with nice fabric carrying bag and different sizes of eartips
*
if you are sensitive to weight or hard metal housings you might want to try the much-lighter panasonic ergofit earbuds: those provide even better comfort for extended listening periods.
even the ergonomic m2 headphones can get a little heavy due to their metal construction.
*
the (well-constructed) cable does transmit some noise to your ears if bumped or tapped; this isn't a big deal but can catch you unawares
*
"you might wish to play with an equalizer a bit depending on what you're listening to or watching; the strong bass can occasionally make low sounds (like explosions) too loudbottom line:if you are looking for great sound at a great price, try these out."
"they sound as good as, or better than, much more expensive headphones."
"(for instance, i think they sound about as good as apple's airpods, which i listened to briefly but did not find comfortable.)"
very impressed with the quality of the headphones and the packaging.
it was very satisfying to open the box.
the earphone perform very well and does an amazing job when it comes to noise cancelation.
the mic while sending a voice message seems to work perfectly fine.
overall i'd say i’m very satisfied with the product it fits comfortable in my ears
the quality of sound is amazing and the quality of the build is fantastic
my twelve year old daughter goes through earbuds faster than i can buy them.  
i have tried so many from inexpensive to way too high priced.
she has had some last a day.
she does not like the wireless
so i’m always on the hunt for a wired pair that will hold up.
so far these are doing the trick.
and she uses them a lot!
and she is probably not the most gentle person taking them in and off.
she listens to music on her phone and uses them in class when required.
she said that the sound is good quality and comfortable in her ears.
she even raves about the red wires because it’s her favorite color.
i've had these headphones for a solid minute and i have to say the sounds is great
and it really does drown out outside noise.
really like all the extras that it has the large choice of ear bud cushions and the nice nice pouch it comes with i easily put them in there and go.
most others i would roll up and toss in my pocket
these have the nice pouch to carry them in.

"i ordered these at the end of november, they served me well for the two months they were alive but things went downhill quickly."
"soon, the wiring started glitching despite never subjecting the headphones to any significant stress."
the volume would rise by itself all the way to the max continuously even with a nudge of the wire.
"days later, the music began to start and stop unpredictably, skipping forward and backwards and even activating siri completely involuntarily."
"i don't know if marsno has anything they can do, but my experience was less than great."
update:
"marsno sent new earbuds and they seem to be working just fine, the customer service is very responsive to your needs"
edit:
the company contacted me after my initial review and apologized and offered to sent replacements which came extremely fast and are working great so far.
good product and good customer
servicei've had these for about 2 months.
the sound quality is nice but leaves a bit to be desired.
luckily i have an lg v40 which allows a ton of audio customization
so i was able to get it to sounding perfect
"my big issue is the headphones are already broken it will randomly change the song it will bring up google ,stop the music all together, when i try and make a call it hangs up the call"
immediately i've checked with three other pairs of headphones
i have none of them do this only this set
"the build: it's nice feeling, has a metallic feeling on the earbuds.  "
overall it feels like a good build.
sound:
"it has clear sounds, good noise cancellation, has some bass (which is a huge plus).at this price, it's well worth it.  "
it's comfortable to use.edit
- it wasn't being read as a mic on my phone for some reason.  
"but it does have a mic, so i changed my score to reflect that."
"decent bass, good sound, good noise cancellation, and it works as a mic.  "
at that price.
yes it's worth it.
i really love the metal headphones.
that alone makes these feel much more durable than plastic styled one's i've used in the past.
"i'm really glad these came with different sized ear sleeve things , that really allowed me to customize the fit."
most one size fits all...never fits me.
the in-line control is very easy to use.  
had no issues using this with my samsung galaxy phone and my kindle fire...
both with cases on them.
plugged in fine.
"sound is good, bass is good."
no issue!
these are some very good headphones considering the price point.
the only wired earbuds i usually use are the apple earpods.
i’d say these are a bit better or on par with the default apple headphones that come in the box with an iphone (which separately retail for $29).
what is really good is the cords.
they don’t nearly tangle as easily as the apple earpods.
also these isolate sound better than the earpods as well.
"lastly, i like the color combo."
"overall, i am happy with my purchase!!however, most people use headphones to workout and i am completely not sure if u can use these for a workout since the manufacturer did not mention anything about being"
weather/sweat resistant.
"other than that, this is a great deal."
i do want to start with saying that marsno has great customer service.
now to the actual headphones.
honestly the quality feels great.
"sound quality could be a little bit better but for the price, its pretty good."
the included controller is nice addition to it.
my problem was in the sound balancing due to the connection between the headphone jack and my phone or whatever device
(i made sure it wasn't a problem with my phone).
the first pair i bought occasionally had the right earbud drop in volume by up to 30% off the other one.
eventually the right earbud died completely within a month.
so i contacted marsno and they sent me a replacement pair.
this pair is now starting to have the same problems.
i like the company
so i don't want to bother them by causing them more loses by having them constantly sending my new earbuds.
therefore im just going to try and find a new pair.
if they end up fixing this problem i might consider buying them again but i would also like to see an l shaped connector instead of an i shaped connector.
edit
: i'm bringing this review up to 4 stars because of how awesome the customer service is.
i got really busy during the month of may and most of june as i had to focus on my studies and they continued to follow up with me.
to say the very least they will continue to have my business.
also my review is outdated as they have since updated the earbuds to address these problems.
i am really happy that they put the time in to listen to their customers and help to help them out.
these headphones had pretty good sound quality
and i actually liked the way they fit in my ears
(i have small ears and earbuds
"tend to fall out, these didn't).  "
but something in them shorted out and the right earbud completely stopped working.
"the mic/control piece seemed to be the culprit for the short, as it would randomly-and without being touched-switch songs, turn off or open google assistant.  "
too bad.
they were also super cold in the morning since they were metal
but that's a minor detail.
update:  
marsno contacted me about my review and sent me a new pair to try.  
these sound much better.  
"i'm not going to lie, they're still not on the same level as my brainwavz,  but they're pretty good.  "
"thank you for your excellent customer service, marsno.  "
i will buy again as an affordable alternative.
these do not sound nice.  
the description of these doesn't match the actual sound quality at all.  
"because of the good reviews on here, i'm led to believe i have a defective pair."
will be returning.
disappointed.
"sound was great, earbuds weren't all that comfortable"
but i got used to it.
"however, these headphones didn't last 3 months."
now i use headphones at work 6 days a week for 8 hrs a day sometimes 10hrs a day.
so i put them to use
and i was careful with these.
"unfortunately, the plug in part that goes into your phone started to go out and"
"when that happens, your headphones are history."
time to toss them!
i understand using headphones the way i use them which is basically everyday for about 50+
hrs a week can really wear headphones down.
"this product was very well packaged, and arrived in as manufactured condition."
"the 3.5mm trrs connector measured slightly oversize, and was a tighter fit into my iphone se"
then does/did the apple oe headphone connector.
removal of the connector showed no major imprint of the socket.
"when used on my 8,1 mbp the on cable click adjuster for volume resulted in a complete ramp to max or min volume levels with no stepping whatsoever, interesting, but volume was easily controlled via f10, f11, & f12 keys."
sound reproduction outweighs the minimal 'eh's' entirely.
"tonal range reproduced by the earbuds was accurate, and pleasing."
would buy again.
"while i understand that these are budget low-cost headphones, i expected them to last more than a couple of weeks."
almost immediately i began to see issues.
first impression is that they are very cheaply made - even more so than other earbuds at this price range.
"almost immediately after using them, the casing near the top of the earbud came loose."
"no big deal, i thought, because it doesn't really impact functionality."
"then a few workouts in, other non-essential pieces started to come loose."
the final straw was as i was working out the cord snagged on a machine
and then it metaphorically blew up.
the left earbud stopped functioning completely.
the right earbud was full of static and essentially the whole thing was useless.
"i understand that the cord getting caught was my fault, but this was hardly one of those full-on hard snag situations."
"if you are going to be using these to work out or really anything more than sit at home and listen, i would take a hard pass on these earbuds."
i truly love these headphones!
"the sound is great, the quality is clear and crisp."
the cord seems to be longer than most pairs i own.
i love that the buds arent made of plastic like most pairs out there.
"they fit comfortably and snug, they didnt fall out of my ears and they stayed in place with no problem.  "
i absolutely love the color of them as well.
they're honestly probably better than my beats.
i look forward to purchasing an additional pair for back up.
please consider making a purple or teal pair 😁
i'm super rough on my earbuds and these are super solid.
"well-made, comfortable and durable with great sound so very happy with that."
the only problem is after two weeks they started randomly jacking up the volume crazy high when i'm just sitting there not even touching them :/
not quite annoying enough yet to replace them but something to be aware of
"i got these for listening to music while travelling and commuting and phone calls, which i frequently do a few hours a day.  "
"was looking for something that has great sound quality for music, good sound and mic quality for phone calls, and a cord that is rugged enough for constant use and does not get tangled.  "
also wanted something at a reasonable price.  
i think the marsno's are great and meet these needs.  
cord does not tangle and overall build seem excellent - above what i would expect for the price.
"comparing the sound to my beyerdynamic $200 over the ear headphones with pre-amp isn't really fair, but i would say the music sound quality of the marsno's is very good: full in the bass, could maybe be a little clearer in the mid-range, nice highs, and is overall very pleasing and enjoyable."
the customer service is great  5 stars - i had a connection problem with my phone (windows os) and they took care of things very fast & 100% satisfied.
pros:these earphones feel and look really nice.
they're encased in metal and the wire coating is a sturdy rubber that doesn't tangle
oftenthey have a microphone and volume +
play/pause buttonsthey sound pretty good for the price point and
the bass response is solidthey come with extra ear tips of different sizesthere's definitely a premium feel at a price point where you wouldn't expect that kind of a feel.
con (but not
really):the earphones
i got had a minor defect but the customer representative was very eager to replace them and they were super responsive + caring.
the new ones are perfect.
"i am not a fan of wired headsets, but these are one of the best i've ever used.  "
"after i adjusted the size of the buds to fit my ears, the head set stays in place through out the day."
"the sound is very good and, while it doesn't cancel all the outside noise, it does cover most.  "
i can't hear my neighbors at work while using these.  
i comes in a couple of colors and i chose red.
i also liked the controls to pause and skip tracks.
i recommend these headphones.
i've been using the marsno m2 wired headphones for about a week now.
i love the way the earbuds are shaped as they fit extremely well in my ears.
they have a tilt to them which makes them easier to fit inside.
the sound is very crisp and clear.
i loved the acoustics.
the bass is not too strong.
it's easy to switch from listening to your music to your calls.
when i put them on i am in my own world as they cancel out all noise around me.
i would definitely recommend these headphones.
"if you're looking for quality at a good price,these are the ones."
"i have the black buds with the red cord, and i really like them!"
"they came with a whole bunch of different bud sizes, a clip for attaching the wire to clothes, a velcro cable tie, a little carry bag, and attractive packaging."
"the jack end and headphones are both sturdy-feeling metal construction, and the cable is slippery against itself"
so it's easy to untangle.
"the sound from them seems a little on the bassy side to me, but honestly we all need a little more of that in our life."
if i had a word to describe these earbuds for me?
fragile.
"i'm a bike commuter, so i want earbuds while i'm on the road."
within a month they already became damaged to the point that they're unusable.
"no drops, no sudden jerks out of the phone, no washing machine accidents, just keeping the device in my pocket was its end."
"the sound quality was meh, noise cancellation was on point, so much"
so i had to take them out on the road sometimes
"so i could hear oncoming traffic, but that's the point of noise cancellation right?i'm not saying these are bad earbuds."
"it's an ok buy for doing nothing, but for workouts, they aren't cut out."
just a little pocket bend and the earbuds were done.
big sad :/
these are great!
i have a set of bluetooth headphones as well
but i always forget to charge them
so i always have this in my gym bag for backup.
they sound great and
"although i prefer wireless, it’s always good to have a set of wired headphones as well.  "
i prefer these when i’m on bike at the gym or on the treadmill
time will tell.
i’ve been buying $100 headphones (beats) roughly every 3 year for a long while now.
they would eventually split open near the jacks and become useless.  
mind
you
"i’m a mild user (just power walking) 7, 8 or 9+ times a month."
these are so much thinner but the sound quality is about 90% of the high dollar set.
so at less than a quarter of the price
it’s seems well worth it if they’ll last a year.
if they last a few years they’ll pay for themselves.
had problems with first set.
"when buying from china, you get what you pay for."
"(just being honest, good people not so good quality)."
but the company worked with me and now i have good pair of headphones.
so about the headphones.
i am using the sound suppressing ends .
the seam to give me the best range of music.
i like the bass because it is full without overpowering the vocals with that muddy bass smearing/blat sound you get with those base focused ear buds.
the mid range and voice is clear and the upper range is clear and tight for the price.
i use ear buds allot and these are keepers.
"if you go through head phones like i do , (snag on stuff)"
these are a good buy.
the first thing i noticed was the noise cancellation.
much better than others i owned.
i think it has to do with that the earbuds and shaped different and go into your ear from a different angle which fits very comfortably.
a very rich sound with a deep but not overbearing bass.
simply put all my songs sound a little better with these earbuds.
easy to use volume controls.
expensive looking packaging makes it a good looking gift with 6 replacement buds inside.
i am very happy with purchase.
i have both their m1 and now this m2 model.
"so far, both sets of these headphones have lasted quite a long time."
they’ve held up over the daily abuse of me plugging and unplugging dozens of times a day.
the sound quality is the best i’ve heard
(i’ve tried many earphones in the past).
i’m really satisfied with these headphones and plan to continue using their products.
"i am a repeat buyer of marsno headphones and i keep coming back because i like comfortable headphones, with really good sound, that are a good value for their price.  "
when i unpacked the headphones what stood out to me were the red cables and the look of the earbuds.  
i went and took them for a run
and i really appreciated the comfort and sound quality.  
it was a great buy for me
and i look forward to using them again and again.
there is nothing to dislike.
the quality and the sound of the product is great.
i have used many ear headphones over the years; but i either found they were uncomfortable or the connection to the cellphone did not work.
i also like the line which is a bit shorter than others and has the advantage it does not become so entangled that it takes minutes to get them straightened out.
also marsno offered friendly and quick service when i was not quite clear on how to best use the device.
sounds very much like my jbl earphones without having to pay the premium.
"at 15$, hands down, one of the best."
"bass is extreme, mids and lows are clear."
voice clarity at its finest on calls.
no noise cancellation though.
unique design and metallic finish with tons of extra buds stands out
first off i do not use the microphone function.
"the build quality is very good, and is much better than the last couple of earphones i have had."
the sound is good and better than the last couple of sets i have owned as well.
what gives it an edge is that it has a better response in lower frequencies.
for me it is very comfortable to use.
my primary use is to listen to music from my phone.
i am happy with this product.
this headphones are awesome!
and for a cheap price!
"i love the shape of them, they go in and stay in your head very well!"
"i was a little skeptical at first, but after trying them"
i dont think i'll go back to skull candy.
they came with a little velcro tab to keep it from being tangle and the mic has 3 buttons!
all headphones need 3 buttons i think!
anyway.
"i like them, especially for when i'm at the gym or my bluetooth headphones die."
even just as a backup pair these would be worth it i think.
i was very disappointed in this product.
i actually got two pairs of these headphones because i thought the first pair was simply defective.
"but alas, the second pair had the same problem and is now being sent back."
"these headphones cannot handle static electricity so if you live in the north or in places with winter expect that every time you move and generate a little static electricity, it will turn up the volume."
i can walk five steps in winter and the headphones are blasting in my ears.  
"i have to quickly turn it down again, to just have it increase again."
i thought the second pair might be different -
but it is now late april
"and i don't even hear/feel any static, but the volume still goes up to full as i walk down the street with my jacket on."
i have had apple headphones
/microphones for years and even another pair ( i don't remember which brand)
"and never had this happen, though i would hear or felt the static shocks as i took off my coat in the winter."
i recommend looking for another brand.
fortunately i was able to send back this second pair - too bad i'm still stuck with the first pair!
these headphones sound good for the price
and they seem well made.
the reason i only gave them 2 stars is i can't use them with my phone.
everyone that calls me complains the echo back to them is horrible.
i considered it may be my phone
but it is new
and i didn't have that problem with my last headphones.
it is inconvenient to have to remove my headphones every time i get a phone call.
kind of defeats the purpose of buying a headset with a built in mic.
"the metal construction is cool and it makes these headphones more durable, but it also makes them quite heavy compared to plastic ones."
sound quality was fine but the cord itself is the complete opposite of tangle free.
the cord tends to wrap around itself often and would tangle up on me even while in use.
this is extremely frustrating when jogging or working out with these headphones on.
so between the heaviness and constant tangled cord i would give these headphones a hard pass.
you’re better off with plastic and tangle free headphones.
"i bought these for my boyfriend to use with his laptop at work, for some reason he can't get wireless headphones to connect to it"
so i got him these ones.
i have a thing for headphones
so i of course had to try them out.
😂
🤣
"these are of really good quality, the sound is nice and clear, and the bass..."
the bass bumps!!
!
i definitely did not expect them to be this good!!
i just might have to get another pair for myself!!
☺☺
to be honest
i wasn't expecting much for the price
but i was definitely surprised!!
"the build quality is superb, and the sound is a lot better than most at that price."
"i really enjoy the deep bass you get from the these, the packaging is like something you would get for a high priced pair."
i've seen numerous reports that customer service is outstanding
but i'm afraid that i have nothing that needs that service as i am very satisfied with this purchase!
"they sound great, even stay on while running."
"downside is they break pretty fast, the plastic material used for the volume knob is cheap, and the cable itself is pretty cheap."
"better off getting different brand, i recommend anker buds."
they're decent headphones.
"the cord is nice and thick and stiff, so they don't tangle much."
the volume controls work.
my main complaint is about the sound quality.
they're very bass heavy and it makes general listening sound muffled.
the microphone also does not do very well if there is any background noise.
there are better headphones out there at this price point.
note:
i was compensated with a free product in exchange for this review.
5 stars for product’s quality.
it is sturdy compared to other cheap headphones and the sound quality is simply amazing!
you can hear the bass very clearly and the headphone’s
"color looks nice on everything you use: pc, phones, etc.  "
definitely a first choice for any of you who prefer quality over quality.
"i was looking for headphones, but realized i might as well get a set with a microphone too.  "
i use these with an mp3/fm player while on walks and absolutely love them.  
"i think the fit, feel, and length of the cord are just right.  "
i have not yet tried the microphone quality
"but if it's anything like the sound quality, i'm sure it will be great.  "
"if you're looking for a set of wired headphones, look no further!"
these headphones are great.
they provide clear deep sound for such an inexpensive price.
"i received what i believed to be partially defective headphones with an inoperable increase volume button, but marsno customer service is fixing the issue immediately."
"things happen, sometimes defectives get through, but it's about how it's taken care of, and they do stand behind their product 100 percent."
"for the normal music listener, i wouldn't suggest these headphones."
the high-mids to high sounds are lost.
these remind me of the beats headphones where the bass is exadurated to the point where the high treble is lost.
"i tried the ear buds on multiple devices: moto z2 play, iphone 4, dell laptop,(all through spotify on very high quality)"
"then rca sound system, and through the 3.5mm on a ps4 controller."
the sound i feared was the same.
"the reason i give these a 3 stars is for thier sound on edm, trap, and more bass heavy music."
if you primarily enjoy these genres the ear buds sound generally great.
"otherwise, classical, acoustic, rock music, and voices do sound very hollow."
i'd suggest those genres to look for a more dynamic set of ear buds.
"i use these headphones at work and they do great in blocking out background noise, plus feel very comfortable wearing for hours at a time."
they also feel very sturdy and will last longer than my previous pairs.
had some issues with the volume control and contacted their customer service.
they were awesome and sent me a second pair to work through the issues.

great fit and great sound quality.  
the only reason i didn’t give the ear buds five stars in noise cancellation is that i haven’t used them on an airplane yet.  
if the noise cancellation i get when i use them at home is any indication of how good they’ll be on a plane then they will be five stars!  
the whole transaction from order placement to delivery was great.  
definitely recommend this product and vendor.
sound quality and fit were fine.
but i bought them for working out.
they didn’t even make it two months before the right side blew out and the mic is no longer understandable for calls.
possibly adequate for light users but not made for exercise.
update:
marsno reached out to me after the initial review and replaced the headphones.
the second pair is working well and i’m using them as a backup.
excellent customer service.
these headphones are simply amazing.
i am beyond impressed with every aspect of them!
the unboxing was crazy good.  
they came with a nice felt bag for them to be put in.
the material the earbuds are made of is metal.
this makes them very sturdy.
they came with several extra ear covers.
they also came with a clip to hold them to your shirt or wherever.
the cord is nice and strong.
it doesn't tangle at all.
i have tried several different kinds of earphones and these are top quality!
they are well made and very comfortable.
they are decently priced too.
i highly recommend them!
i bought these for a friend a while back then used them after going to her place over the weekend
and i like them more than mine
so i bought myself a pair.
the sound quality is great!
the bass is very important to me when getting earbuds
and they did it very well with these.
sounds clear and loud.
there's a review on youtube that said these are similar to the beats earbuds which is pretty accurate.
these are my absolute favorite.
definitely recommend to everyone.
i needed headphones while traveling to and from work.
a friend of mine has had them for 2 years and they are still working.
i like the built quality and the sound quality of the headphones.
"they come with a bag and extra replacement pieces to change if the ear pieces ruin, which is great."
the headphones have control volume and skip buttons.
the only thing is the buttons aren't labeled.
i would have given it 5 stars otherwise.
these are great earbuds!
"well constructed and with great sound, you can tell these are much better than other cheapo earbuds on amazon."
"one thing i really like is the ability to adjust the volume with the mic button digitally (it actually changes the volume on they phone, not just via analogue on the switch."
the mic and sound quality is great.
these are great earbuds!
"well constructed and with great sound, you can tell these are much better than other cheapo earbuds on amazon."
"one thing i really like is the ability to adjust the volume with the mic button digitally (it actually changes the volume on they phone, not just via analogue on the switch."
the mic and sound quality is great.
"i have bought many, many headphones over the years and finally decided that i just could not use them any more."
they were always just too uncomfortable and left my inner ears hurting.
these headphones have a unique angle with a very solid metal body.
"i use them for listening to music through my cell phone, and the quality is better than i thought the mp3s were capable of.  "
nice product.
would buy again.
i ordered these headphones to help me study while i work inside the library and don’t want to bother others.
they are a very nice quality and come with replacement buds as well as a case to put them in.
the case helps majorly because it helps the wires not get tangled up in my bag
and i always know where to find them.
"these ear buds don’t seem cheap , and the bag that the replacement buds come it is actually really thick and nice."
these earbuds were very affordable.
the sound quality was amazing for the price.
i've owned many many different pairs of earbuds and these would rank in the top 5.
it also cancels a lot of the background noise because of the earbud.
"i've run in these and they don't fall out easily, so thats a plus for me."
they've worked very well so far.
i would highly recommend getting these especially considering the price.
"update:  after contacting vendor, they replaced the earbuds quickly with a new pair.  "
"they wanted to old pair back to investigate the issue, and credited my account for the shipment cost.  "
this company did an amazing job backing up their product and warranty.
the new pair work great with no issues!  
fidelity is excellent (as other reviewers have mentioned).  
i would gladly reorder from this company again!+++++++++++++seemed like well constructed earbuds.  
"however, the jack began shorting out after just a few weeks.  "
"so long as you stay perfectly still, they work great, with excellent sound."
"i’m pretty careful with all my gear, and i tried the earbuds in other electronics.  "
same disruption issue if you move the cord unfortunately.
these earphones are lightweight and good  for blocking out surrounding noise.
earbuds come with several different sizes for the best fit.
they are soft no and discomfort even if i have it in for couple of hours.
speakers and mic are clear and the sound quality is great.  
the cable is long enough that i can move freely around my table.
a nice carrying pouch is a great addition.
best for everyday listening and very comfortable!
"these headphones have a solid build quality and a very deep bass, however, the bass takes over for the clarity in the sound and i would personally say that these are very nice for the price, but being the audiophile that i am"
i must say that the kz zst are better sounding.
overall if you don't care about the sound quality as much and do about the bass
then i'd totally recommend these!
edit:
"very important, please readi won't get rid of what i posted previously because it is, ultimately, still an issue."
"however, if you have an issue definitely don't be afraid  to email customer service with your concerns."
"i informed them of the issue, not expecting anything out of it, and they offered to send me a replacement."
which they did!
"they're definitely dedicated to resolving any issues you might have, and the sound quality is pretty good, so i'd definitely recommend buying them."
"though there is a risk of them breaking far quicker than they should, issues such as this can easily and swiftly be handled by contacting customer service!---------------------old reviewwhile the sound quality of this item is fantastic, i haven't had mine for more than a week, a week and a half at most...and sound in the right side has decreased drastically."
"the left side sounds as good as it always did, while the right is barely audible."
i really can't recommend these in good conscience.
"i just recently purchased this product for my mp3 player, needing earbuds with a volume control option, unfortunately the volume control did not work with my ""valoin"" mp3 player."
"disappointing because the sound quality is fantastic, especially for the price."
i contacted customer service and was very pleased with the service they provided.
"by the way, the volume control worked perfectly on my iphone. ..."
a good product -with great customer service!louis

bought these for my husband who listens to books on audible.
he's quite hard on his earbuds and is picky about quality.  
his favorite feature about these are they are tilted for a snug fit inside the ear.
these earbuds come packaged in a sturdy box with several extra earbud attachment pieces to guarantee a perfect fit.
the sound is good quality and they appear to be quite durable.
these are not poorly made with cheap parts.  
i highly recommend these earbuds.
i purchased two of these headphones to have a back up just in case.
"after about a month of using one pair ,i noticed the left earpiece would lose sound very suddenly."
you can still hear what you're listening too just very faintly.
i didn't think too much of it and kept using it.
"eventually, it bothered me since you're hearing majority of everything through your right earpiece."
so i open my back up pair and use it for less than a month and the same thing is happening.
the left earpiece is losing sound again.
i noticed now after about 2-3 hours of use the left earpiece will go quiet.
i'm not one to write reviews often
but it's been a nuisance for a little while now.
"hopefully, marsno's customer service is as great as i've read."
i use headphones to listen to music/podcasts on my phone
and i listen a couple of hours per day on average.
these lasted about two weeks before one of the earbuds gave up.
"it still plays sound, but it's at half the volume of the ""good"" earbud."
"i always buy cheapo earphones, knowing i'll need to replace them when they (sometimes literally) fall apart, but this one crapped out by far the quickest of all i've tried."
i give it a thumbs down and a disappointed frown.
"really nice earphones, seem to be made well, very durable."
sounds good and cancels out the noise real good.
"my only concern is that i ordered gold and got pink, a little disappointed but well."
"picture a 71 year old man with pink earphones, oh well."
the sound quality while listening to music is great
but when i make a phone call to someone all they hear is static.
i bought these mainly to make phone calls
but i can only use them for music.
think i'm going to return these since they don't serve the purpose i was looking for.
"these headphones have great sound quality; audio always sounded loud, crisp, and clear while using them."
i found i wasn't having to turn the volume on various devices as high as i normally would.
"however, i don't believe these headphones have much of a noise cancelling quality."
"although audio sounds loud, it doesn't drown out much outside noise."
i could clearly hear people around me even with the headphones in and the volume up.
"but other than that, the headphones worked well, and they are quite durable, too."
"i've had them for a couple months now, and they are still working fine, even with three kitties in the house that target any type of cord."
i also appreciate that the headphones are packaged in such a neat little tin; it's a nice touch.
"overall, these headphones are a worthwhile purchase, especially with the price."
i'd definitely recommend them.
i bought these in pink first but thought i lost it
so i got the gold pair.  
the rose pink actually went for a wash in my washer machine and dryer.
i thought they were goners
but before throwing them out i tried them.  
they still worked perfectly.  
definitely worth the money.
the shipping was really fast and the color is so beautiful!  
i bought it for my wife
and she is happy.  
i wish the magnet is a bit stronger.
"while i have only had these headphones for a short amount of time, for the price i paid at the time of purchase, the quality is excellent.  "
i enjoy the volume slider on the cable over the usual buttons on other headphones.  
"when you crank the volume highest, it isn't distorted or bad at all.  "
"if you are looking for headphones on a budget, i recommend these hands down."
so far good in terms of sound while listening to music or video.  
it appears that the caller can hear me
", the only downfall is that the microphone is faraway from the mouth and i sometimes have to hold it close to me, but of course i can't do that while driving, so i have to figure this one out.  "
it is very sensitive to sound
", i don't hear that much crackling like i normally would with other ear devices.  "
i do like the warranty that is provided.
i was hesitant of buying these
but i decided to put faith in the reviews.
when i first received them it came in a little tin with 3 different earbuds sizes.
it did have a faint plastic chemical smell
but it faded away after a few hours.
the magnetic bits really help keep it untangled and the sound quality is amazing for the price.
"if you’re looking for a pair of good, durable, and cheap earbuds get these!"
fast delivery.
the product works amazing.
"i turned my phone up all the way and with volume controller on the earbuds, the volume will blow you away."
i have to turn the volume on headphones down half way
its so loud and the button pauses and plays songs perfect.
"i have had a lot of earbuds, expensive ones."
this is the first one i could get the volume button to work properly.
i definently recommend this product.
"beautiful color too, rose pink."
"the cord is heavy duty, not flimsy like most of them."
they came in a beautiful tin box with extra ear plugs.
these earphones are really
"pretty, comfortable (comes with different attachable ear size pieces)"
", the sound quality is okay compared to other earphones i own."
i like that they have a sliding volume control on the mic part which i haven't seen before on other earphones.
i also like that the backs of the earphones are magnetic
so there's less of a chance they'll get tangled.
the company is also really nice; i received a buy 1 get 1 free coupon -- since i bought these earphones already they're gonna send me another free gift!
they also sent a coupon for an extra 6 months warranty -- their warranty for this product is already a year -- so with the extra warranty you get a year and a half.
these are great perks for the price!
would be a returning customer.
purchase 2 sets for my son's
"and i love the rose gold color btw,"
"the ear buds compared to my beats by dre is fantastic, can't beat the price and the sound quality is actually surprisingly good."
"ear buds are well put together and feel like the expensive beats by dre, love these ear buds and probably will purchase more for the family in the near future."
these are absolutely worth it.
they have great noise cancellation for in-class test purposes.
"when doing projects, i can plug them in and block everything while listening to crystal clear music."
"my one complaint is that when you turn both your device and headphones to a certain volume, people around you can hear your sick beats."
"that can bother most people, and it bothers me some, but they have to get pretty loud for that to happen"
so i deal with it.
by far my favorite pair of headphones.
"i have had them for about 11 months now and the cord has sliced a tiny bit, but that was my fault, (or the scissors.)"
these are a total must have for the price.
winner!
i'm not sure what the point of the magnets connecting the two magnets is.
i suppose it might be helpful to prevent tangling
but as i just got them that is yet to be determined.
rose gold color is pretty.
the slider to temporarily silence music is nice as is the pause button since it eliminates the need to fish my phone out of my pocket.
these are much nicer than my usual headphones
i'll feel guilty when they inevitably go through the wash and die.
(usually not the first time through
but eventually they all go the way of the washer/dryer xd)
they also at least right now have a temporary warranty/ write a review get a free second pair discount thing which is cool.
it was amazing!
the magnetic affect works wonderfully and its durability is amazing!
i love the sound that comes out of it!
definitely noise canceling and surround sound effects!
i love it!
i also love the color and the volume slide on it that works amazingly as well!
and the pause/play button even works to hang up on calls!
10/10!

amazing quality.
my son wants a pair like this now as these were for his sister.
he says the sound quality is amazing.
they’re magnetic too
i love these earbuds!
"the rose gold color is a tad bit pinkish on the wire, but for the most part is very radiant.  "
"the earbuds are magnetic, so they always stick together."
"also, the earbuds are tangle-free!"
"i just got my rose gold, noise canceling, earphones."
"wow, these are beautiful!"
"the sound quality is great, the cords are very high-quality,  "
"the earbuds are very comfortable, and it even comes with extra sets of cushions."
i am very happy with my purchase.
i will update as time goes on for the durability of the product.
however everything i see so far these look like a very good find !
great sound quality
but it just keeps falling out of my ears.
i’ve switched around the buds that are available but still it just slips out every two seconds.
makes it hard to listen to music if i have to keep putting them back on.
also the wires are a bit longer than other earbuds
so it easily snags onto things again causing the earbuds that are only barely fitting into my ears call out.
these are the best ear buds ever.
"this is my second pair, only because i accidentally broke the others."
"they sound amazing, come with a small metal case that you can tote anywhere, and they have two extra pair of the silicone covers."
"they fit really well, as in not too bulky!"
worth a few extra dollars.
these work in my fire tablet and my motorola smart phone.
"love the color, too!"
i wanted to love these.
great price and the magnetic detail was pretty neat.
i used them only one day before one of the ear bud lines pulled out of the volume control completely without warning.
i'm not even sure how it happened but needless to say not happy about it.
"update: after multiple times of friends telling me that there is a lot of background noise and they have trouble hearing me, i got rid of these."
"good only for listening to music or video on your phone, not for phone calls."
i really like the color and style of these
but the left
"ear bud has cut out a couple of times when it's been plugged into my phone, and the microphone doesn't catch your voice well unless you're holding it up close to your mouth."
overall i'm still using them and like them
but i'd probably get a better quality pair next time.
i know this is a cheap pair of earphones
but i expected them to last longer.
it's barely been 2 weeks since i've got them.
the magnet in the earphones somehow flipped
so they repel each other instead and gets super tangled in my pockets.
it is also making a clicking noise and the wires have started to fray.
i'm very disappointed.
do not buy.
i thought these ear buds would be cute bc
"they match my phone, but they don't stay in my ears!"
"the sound is okay, and they seem durable, but if i can't get them to stay in, there's no point."
"they come with 3 sizes of silicone ear pieces, so i attached the smallest size."
"i pushed them into my ears really hard until it hurt, but they immediately fell out."
the weight of the magnet probably didn't help.
i'm sorry
but i have to return them.

so i genuinely like these headphone.
the sounds is pretty good.
and theyre comfortable.
the buds themselves are magnetized so they click together.
i think its to stop them from getting tangled?
but anyway.
they don’t last bery long at all.
i usually have to replace them every two months or so.
which kind of sucks not gonna lie.
i have bought replacements and i’m on my third set at the moment.
theyre a cheap fix if thats what you’re looking for.
these fall out of your ears very easily.
"i’ve been using them for a month or two and they haven’t broken, but they’re definitely not my favorite."
if i do any sort of activity they fall out
i really love these!  
an awesome color than matches my rose gold iphone.  
sound is great!  
"it arrived missing an earbud, but i contacted their customer service and they responded right away and sent me a whole new set of everything."
great product for the value.
the buds themselves are magnetic so you can listen to one without the other flopping around getting tangled in the cord and etc.
at about 7 months one of the ear buds fell apart from the casing.
not the hugest deal since they were only 8 bucks
and i'll actually probably replace with the same ones.
wow.
who would have thought that the earbud sticking together would keep earbud from getting tangled?
not this girl.
i like that the color is soft
", they don't tangle and that the sound for me an whomever i'm talking to on the phone"
is good.
"plus, they are a bargain."
it's win-win for me.
"i grabbed these for my 11 yr old to have at school, usually we never see her school earbuds again, so i don't like spending a lot of money on them."
"she loves them, the magnetic feature is really handy"
", i personally have not listened to them, so can't say from my perspective, but for her the quality of sound is good."
"the value for me is great, thanks for a fashionable and functional product for my daughter, we will be ordering more for the rest of the kids!"
these earbuds were broken hours after i had received them.  
sound would not come out of them.  
"i figured that it must just be my phone's jack, but after trying the earbuds on a friend's phone and my laptop, sound still was not coming out.  "
"i am extremely frustrated, especially since they arrived in the mail about a month late."
"very durable, my 13yo goes through headphones like socks and these have actually lasted"
so well i bought a second pair for her to use at school.
love the case it comes in and the magnets that keep the wires from getting tangled are genuous!!!
i bought these for my daughter
she seems to like them so far.
they seem to be a good product.
arrived on time with no damage.
i am writing this review because if you buy this product they give you one free or you get 5$ off your next amazon purchase
so i will wright another one after i get one or the other or if i even get them at all.
but other then that it seems to be a good product if they last i will be using this company again.
i honestly went into it expecting nothing great
"but they are great, especially for the price!"
i also really like that you can adjust the volume and pause a song on the earbuds line.
i really enjoy these for my train commute!
they definitely help me relax before/after work.
i also liked the presentation/box they were in when they arrived.
i got these for my 13 year old.
she loves them except the piece that covers the part that goes into the phone moves up and down the wire.
we would've tried to exchange them but just missed the cut off date.
they really are good earbuds though.
not great for phone calls.
sound quality was poor on calls and the microphone resting on my chest created static for the other person.
"also the volume knob is a manual slide, and i went from hearing the person to now hearing at all."
haven't tried it for music but poor quality compare to what came with my samsung galaxy
didn't really like these headphones.
"i thought the sound quality was fine, but not super amazing or anything."
"first thing off, they are pretty heavy due to being magnetic."
"they would constantly fall out of my ears when i was wearing them, which was super frustrating"
and i had to readjust them all the time.
"furthermore, they only lasted about two and a half months which was disappointing, but not unexpected since they're pretty cheap."
"on the bright side, the fact that they were magnetic was actually really nice and helped them stay less tangled, just wish they weren't so heavy."
"if you're looking for headphones, i'd say you should pay a little more for something a lot better"
"i bought these as a secondary pair of earbuds, because my noise cancelling headphones sometimes pinch my ears.  "
"they work great, and have a mic, so you can use it with your phone also.  "
"fit well in my ears, and have multiple rubber things for different sizes.  "
i can block out background noise but still hear whats going on if necessary.
works well for the $$ the volume control is a little wonky but use phones volume adj instead great deal for the $$ i have paid a lot more for ones that didn't work as well
the product came pretty quickly and in a very nice tin box.
it is a very nice looking pair of headphones and has a very interesting volume control.
the backs of the earbuds are magnetic which is also very cool.
it looks and seems pretty durable and the material it is made of looks
like it is worth more than the amount you pay.
"sound quality is ok, not the best"
but it works!
for the price i am definitely not complaining!
great for the price.  
i bought these to use for work
and they lasted six months.  
i guess
that’s not too bad for being used constantly every day.  
one side stopped working due to the wire disconnecting.  
"ordered another pair, the wire on the new ones is a little shorter"
and i hear crackling noise from time to time in the headphones
"so im not sure these are going to last as long, questioning the quality of the new pair.  "
it comes with a metal case and different sized rubber pieces for your ear
so if it’s too big you can change it.
came in a super useful tin.
"i shall be keeping them in there till i may find another use for it, but one can always have another sealed container for whatever reason."
"look amazing, sound amazing, fit great, pretty comfy."
the volume adjustment and pause
/play button are great.
i'm very happy with them!
"they don't block out all the noise in the world, bit one should be able to hear what is around them for safety reasons."
i was soo surprise to see how excellent these headphones sound.
i was spectacle as to if they were really going to work.
i went to my music app and played a sound with heavy bass and 😎 im loving it.update:
2 months later and one of my ear buds went out 😔.
i got this because of the good reviews.
i shouldve known better because there is no way earphones at this price can be decent anyway.
sound is muffled and trebles literally hurt your ears!
the sound quality is just horrifying..
if you’d like to worsen your hearing go ahead or else just spend extra $10 dollars and get something thats not this terrible
great sound.
however they already don't work.  
i can only hear sound out of one sideupdate:
these didn't even last 6months.
are completely unusable now.
good sound quality - especially for the price.  
comfortable to wear too.
"not bad for the price, but broke almost immediately."
"i've had these headphones for just over a month, and one of the earbuds has already stopped working, and the other is starting to get spotty as well."
"before they broke, they were perfectly fine headphones - nothing special, but did the job."
"however, i am disappointed to have to purchase new headphones after a month of light use."
bought these for my preteen daughter.
received them on january 15th.
"sounded great, worked great..."
but it didn't last!
"on february 19th, she was listening to music with them then suddenly got zapped in one ear, then that earbud lost all sound...for good."
"i read other reviews about these earbuds shocking them, but decided to order anyway.  "
now i regret it.
"seriously, i expected them to last more than a month!  "
"when i replied to an email sent by the seller telling me to let them know of any issues because they are a small company and want complete satisfaction, all they sent back was ""thanks."""
an excellent buy .
i received a note saying i’m having a free gift but one get one free.

e-mail  address is : great.fatima57 gmail.comthank you.
thought they would sound okay based on reviews and that was correct.  
they look horrible.
the two sides were different colors like one side was in full sun for a few weeks (faded).
the magnet back was horrible too.  
they just barely stay together.  
"ended up throwing them away, not worth the hassle."
my earphones broke two weeks ago
so i decided to purchase new ones.
i search for an hour for the best earphones.
when i purchased them i thought they were going to be the same ones i had.
the earphones are the nicest cheapest earphones i owned.
i like how you can control the volume without having to touch your phone.
i definitely highly recommend these for anyone looking for earphones.
"i just wanted some headphones, but i guess i get what i paid for..."
"i’ve had them for 4 months, and one of the earbuds stopped working."
i think i’m going to invest in bluetooth headphones now..
"and i have small ears, and their smallest buds still didn’t fit right."
they were prone to falling a lot.
"i think these would be fine as a spare, but not for everyday use."
these are like ear buds that you would get at the dollar store.
"by no means are they noise canceling, they are cheaply built, and the sound quality isn't all that great."
there's so much feedback and white noise
they're impossible to use.  
save yourself some money and buy ones that actually work.
i purchased this for my daughter as a stocking stuffer.  
she loves it.  
she stated the sound was really good and it was very durable for the price.  
not sure on the noise cancellation yet.  
the color is very pretty and just as pictured.  
boxed undamaged when it arrived.
you basically get what you’re paying for...
probably the most uncomfortable ear buds i’ve had.
any slight movement
and they fall out of my ears.
i have to shove them in pretty far for it to stay for a bit and at that point it sounds like i’m on an airplane and my ears are closed.
any movement on the wires and you can hear it loudly in the earbuds.
they just feel heavy and uncomfortable.
the sound quality isn’t horrible for $8.
"like i said, you’re getting what you pay for"
"ok, en realidad esto"
"no era exactamente lo que ordené, sin embargo funcionan muy bien."
"no soy muy fan del botón de volumen que traen, pero el hecho que cumpla"
con el mando de pausa
y
cambio para huawei superó esos detalles.
respecto a la duración:
vida útil 4 meses 💔
my daughter loves these .. they go well with her phone. .
and the magnets that  keep them from being separated easily is awesome!
i use these on a daily basis.
they are perfect.
sturdy
and they are magnetic
so they stick together making storage easy.
i highly recommend these.
plus they are at a great price!!!
i use these headphones when going to bed.
they're decent.
the sound isn't the greatest for the price and the audio balance is slightly off on my pair (
noticeably louder on the left side)the cord is a bit too long for me
but this is the only pair i've had that doesn't tangle and twist while i'm asleep.
these are pretty good for just a few bucks.
the sound is decent and the noise cancelling is perfect.
i was buying cheap ones over and over just to find i wasted my money.
"when i lose these or my pets drag them off and hide them, i know where to pick up another pair."
i love these earbuds!  
this is my third purchase.
"i keep a pair in the car, a pair in my purse and a pair by my bedside."
i am an avid audio book fan and these deliver excellent audio.
these don’t even fit in my ears let alone stay in.
don’t get the hype about the sound quality—
it’s about what i’d expect for the price.
"these earbuds are a really pretty color, and they match my phone case."
"they have great sound quality so far, but tend to fall out of my ears quite easily."
i have to squish them into my ears for them to stay...
"but other than that, they work pretty well."
i like that you can change the sound level and pause the audio from the cord.
"i liked the looks of these headphones, but within 2 weeks they stopped working with no physical damage."
sound quality was great and fit comfortably.
love the magnetic ends to keep it from trangling.
sadly it did not last very long (4 months).
lost audio on one side and the microphone does not pick up clearly if you don't speak directly into it
(not hands free).
i have tried a lot of earbuds
but i have very small ear canal openings and these seem to fit the best and dont hurt after wearing them for a while.
the rose gold color is also beautiful and matches my fire tablet case.
i would definitely order again.
"thought they were cheap due to the price, but they're pretty good in general."
"the quality isn't the best but still nice, they're loud, and it's basically amazing for the price."
"only thing is that one earbud sounds a bit lounder than the other, needed to adjust the balance to have it at the same volume."
"i took a chance on these, knowing they were ""men's"" earphones and would probably be too big for my ears."
they are
but i still use them.
would love a smaller earpiece in the same unit.
love the magnetic aspect and the hard metal box.
great pair of headphones.
the magnet behind the ear buds helps when wrapping them up to put them away.
they are very pretty too.
"if you're looking for a pair of cheap headphones that will hold up for while, these aren't it."
they worked for approximately 2 weeks.
the magnetic backs were great.
"the sound quality, it was alright."
but don't waste your money if you're expecting them to hold up for a long time.
great sound quality
but i could still hear all the outside noise even when i have put the volume up high.  
the ear pieces are a bit big as well.
if you're not moving around at all these headphones are fine.
"the occasionally shock you though, which isn't fun."
when you're mobile with these earbuds in the music goes in and out.
"these held me over when my old headphones broke, but i'm going to be buying new ones and keeping these as a backup option."
these are excellent -especially for the price.
the sound quality is great and
it’s seriously easy to pause and restart music
/hang up on calls since there’s
only one button.
"the volume is managed with a slider bar, which gives you more finesse."
love these buds!
"it came with a nice little box, the color looks really nice.  "
the sound is pretty good with its price.
these were really horrible.
they were not comfortable at all.
the microphone was mediocare and the sound was hit or miss...
"sometimes it was okay, sometimes there was a random tapping and other times only half the song would come out."
i would not recomend.
my daughter got these for her birthday
she is 12.
great quality without breaking the bank
plus she loves that they attach to each other magnetically.
bought these for a long haul flight.
"they were perfect, sound quality was great and they came with a handy carrying tin."
"liked that there was three options for earbud size, was able to find the perfect fit."
the volume control works great and is really useful.
"the sound is quite nice, much better than i was expecting for the price."
they haven’t broken yet so durability is at least standard.
"i really like the magnetic back feature, really helps keep them from getting as badly tangled."
will probably buy again if something happens to these.
i carry these headphone earbuds around with me where ever i go -
"dr's office, walks, poolside.  "
they are very effective regarding noise reduction and good quality sound.
these are the best earbuds i have ever purchased!
i have had them for quite a while now
and they are absolutely wonderful.
"the sound quality is amazing, especially in terms of the bass which was really surprising!"
the color is beautiful and the fact they are magnetic is great (it keeps them from getting tangled in my pocket)
i would recommend these to anyone looking for a good pair of earbuds at a reasonable price!
"i'm just really happy they sound great, and look adorable!"
came in a cute storage box/
tin.
i really like that i can control the volume with a physical lever/switch.
good little headphones!
not really noise cancelling.
but works great and feels great.
high quality looking and feeling.
worth every penny
"i purchased the rose gold pair hoping for gold quality sound, and i was not disappointed!"
"these are far better than the pair i bought them to replace, and definitely the best earbuds i've ever owned."
"i would recommend these to anyone looking for great sound, though not necessarily for sound cancellation."
i will certainly buy these again if i need another pair.
not working...
one ear bud no longer plays music.  
i want a refund.
interesting that the return time just expired too.
"owner, please contact me asap."
i want a refund!
😠
i really loved these headphones when i received them.
the pink color is gorgeous.
i liked the magnets that held the buds together when not in use.
the volume slider was nice as well.
the sound quality is great for the price.
"unfortunately, one side just stopped completely working within 4 months of purchasing."
i've bought $3 headphones that last years so this was a let down.
"i've only had this product for two months, but it started deteriorating within one month."
"they are absolutely gorgeous, but there is no point in buying a product where i can only hear out of one earbud after only one month."
i bought these earbuds to use while exercising and was very happy with my purchase.
the sound quality is very good in comparison to the cost.
"i will definitely be purchasing more so i can have a pair in my purse, in my desk, and in my night stand too."
this is a great earphone with beautiful golden pink color!
i really like the sound quality and would recommend for a second purchase!
nice
really love these.
my husband is always stealing them even tho
they’re pink!
never tangle and the magnetic ear buds also make it so i can stick them to our metal bed frame and never lose them!
lol
worked great and loved them till they started shocking the inside of my ear.
"not just one shock either, it is like 5 really quick pops with shocks of pain."
when i received these headphones i was astonished by its quality and loved the magnet feature
but after one day of using one of the wires connecting the earbuds completely fell off.
i am so upset and honestly shocked at how easily it happened.
it completely came apart and i now have a a worthless pair of headphones.
these earphones are terrible not only are they super heavy
they sound horrible and if you need them for working out especially don’t buy
got headphones on saturday they worked great for two days.  
sunday one of the headphones stopped working.  
legit lasted 2 days.  
if they werent so cheap i would be pissed.  
but save yourself 9 bucks and put them to a good pair of headphones these are a waste of time.
super disappointed with these earbuds.
like so many others they stopped working after 4 months.
i attempted to use the 1 year warranty and had no luck with the seller.
they kept telling me they couldn't find my order and to try the manufacturer.
wasted time and money.
do not buy these earbuds and avoid this seller.
crappy on every level.
the sound quality is decent and the actual item is good quality.
i only use this a few times a week so
what i need it for it works nicely
i got these to replace some of my skullcandy earbuds and am not disappointed.
"the noise cancellation is okay, definitely not as good as my old skullcandy ones, but alright."
the sound quality is pretty good.
i love the sliding volume control and the pause button for the music is pretty nice.
"all in all, a decent set of earbuds."
these headphones are great.
i love them!
they come a tiny box
and i use it to keep my headphones in place.
"the sound quality is good for the price, so i'm surprised of how good the sound quality is."
i wanted some cheap earphones that work (i lose them too easily or they crap put after a few months).
they're doing their job just fine.
"the complaint i have has to do with design, if i push them into my ear a bit too far then the metal piece feels like it's scratching my ears."
the edges could be smoother.
this headset ehas lectrically shocked my ears several times...
i would send them back if i could.
so when i got my earbuds the case that i was in was open.
and it also looked kinda sus bc it was opened and the case looked kinda dirty with scratches.  
"and when you put the earbuds and push them into your ears, it makes this loud noise."
"and also the volume controller is kinda hard to push, it does not smoothly glide."
the mic part isn't metal also its rose gold plastic.
they are extremely well made.
"sound is great, proce is good, and the fact they magnet together is awesome."
definitely suggest for a corded headphone
i bought them as a back up for when i misplace my favorite ones.
mic and sound is good
"bought a different style of headphones from this brand and they were crap, but these are excellent."
these have some bass and the quality is clear.
haven't had issues neith them at all.
they are really heavy evidenced by them falling out of my ears regularly.
no good for listening in one ear at a time.
the placement of the mic is useless and you have to hold it
so it's close to your mouth.
"these are not the top of the line headphones by far, but they are very durable and comfortable and have pretty decent sound."
i also love the tin box it comes in.
they have taken a beating for the past month and still work great.
i would purchase again.
is why i purchased.  
the price was right.
i will use for audible books.  
the quality is fine.
"for serious music, i use serious buds."
most confortable pair i have bought.
sound is good and i love the adjustment slide bar.
definitely worth it.
"the part that adjusts the sound is quite heavy, so the earbuds fall out of my ears pretty frequently"
(but maybe i have poorly shapen ears).
also it's only been two months and as of yesterday the left ear bud no longer works :
"(however they were quite cheap when i bought them, so"
i guess i got what i paid for.

great sound.
reasonably priced.
i love the color.
sturdy well made earbuds.
"the sound quality of these headphones are fine, but they're so heavy."
i can barely get them to stay in my ear.
any little tug on the wire
and they fall out.
"i keep finding myself having to hold the wire up as i'm listening with them, and readjusting them way more than i do other earbuds."
i got these to just keep in my bag to use for whenever i needed headphones.
i took them out to use them for the first time and one ear piece doesn’t work.
very disappointed.
the sound quality is magnificent and they aren't easy to break.
"the noise cancellation works at a distance, but is still incredible."
love them.
i just received my pair in the mail today.
"i was a bit nervous, as the reviews on these earbuds seem to be split 50/50."
"however, i got mine with no problem and they work fantastically."
"good sound quality for music, and calling is fantastic too."
"the mic has a little static, but otherwise the volume control and mic work well."
for work out is not that good as it comes out really easy and for noise cancelation is based on the device.
i really like them because they come with three different size ear buds!
also i like that you can control the volume on the cord
"but, most of all i like the fact that the two ear pieces are magnet"
do they sick together
and you don't have to worry b about them b getting tangled!!!!
i was really surprised on the sound quality
it sounds really good.
also i can't really hear alot of sounds with the earphones on with the volume all the way up.
noise cancellation is there!
i like the sturdy wiring it also helps them to not get tangle.
i will keep updating the review to see how long they last me since i go through earphones fast.
"i have tried many products similar to this for my iphone 6.bluetooth or wired, non oem was not working well with … until i found this."
this is only one so far working well with my iphone.
i strongly suggest others to try this!this is very good for money
you pay
i think these are very good headphones.
they cancel noise very well.
i love how they connect together magnetically.
the volume control on them works wonderfully.
i would highly recommend these.
"these headphones were good while they lasted however, that was not as long as i thought they would."
the sound is very muffled.
"i think it's because of the batteries, also a bit heavy."
do not recommend.
good quality sound but very disappointed that the ear bud covers are not clear as advertised in the picture.
they are a dark grey which i do not like at all.
great product fits perfect
looks very pretty!
great sound and looks very sturdy!
good quality at a very reasonable price!!it came with a note that i apparently won 100% buy one get one free?!
hmmm.....
luuuuv it!!!
if i could give zero stars i would.
bought these a few months ago
and they’ve already stopped working.
"i got what i paid for, i guess."
save your money and buy a decent pair.
good quality.  
great sound and microphone is nice
when i first bought it it would randomly pause while i was listening to music or turn on siri both on my laptop and iphone.
now it's acting very weird and muffling
sounds when i play videos.
i would recommend something else as it hasn't even lasted me a month and there were problems with it from start.
i've had these headphones for a little over 2 months and they've already stopped working!
i used them while at work and not even every day and they are already trash.  
the sound was crap to (sort of had an echo).
i guess you really do get what you paid for......
(only
rated them 1 star because i had to)
awesome headphones with great price.
"convenient to use, love that they are magnetized and stick together"
i bought these several months ago and they’re still going strong.  
they work great and i love the little metal box they come in.
loved these earphone bought them already 3x.
love the quality and bass.  
my favorite earphones.
shipped early.
good quality.
the buds grip is a little tricky.
i found my way around that though.
it's hard to explain how i did it.
but i basically just fiddled with it
and then it stuck.
these headphones were delivered with a badly damaged and broken jack so they could not be used at all.
the jack would not even fit in the phone since it was crocked.
i could not return them as i was travelling and did not have the time to do so...
the return window closed by the time i made it back to the us
"great sound quality, adjustable sound and just plain cool looking.  "
go perfectly with my pink phone cover too.
"they dont stay in my ears very well, but other than that, i love them!"
"i liked the color they match my ipad and iphone ,"
i also like the fact that there is a magnet so the headphones actually stick together.
i've tried many headphones and these lasted much longer than any other ones that i've tried.
"i can be a but rough on them too, and they work just fine still!"
i love the magnetic buds.
and the container they come in!
definitly will (and already have) recomend these to others.
these earphones are great for the price.
my daughter loves them and said they were loud enough for her traveling back and forth to work while riding the bus.
my volume was half up
and it drowned everyone out.
completely noise cancelling.
love these so much.
bought them for running- perfect!
never worked.  
arrived and could not ever get them to work
"great earphones for the price, has an enclosure in metal good to protect it when do not use."
works great
loves these earbuds.
they are comfortable and sound great.
great ear buds.  
perfect for extra pair to carry in my work bag.  
company sent offer to claim free gift when ear buds received.  
not sure what free gift is yet
but i responded so will see.
these did not fit inside my ears!!
they are huge.
and you need an adapter for using in the iphone.
"they are very poorly made, i would look elsewhere."
i’ll never be ableto
"use them, because they keep falling out."
total waste of money.
"product was a gift for my daughter, she lives the color and has no issues with the earbuds"
muy good material and audition
these headphones never work.
sound comes out of only one ear at a time!  
terrible product.
love the magnets that clip the headphones together.
"no real noise cancellation, though the size options for the ear pieces do allow for a snug fit."
really good quality for the price.
i would definitely recommend!
only problem i have with it is sometimes it comes out of my ear
"and it only lasted me 5 months, but"
i did contact customer service and they helped me out with no problems.
they started off working great until one side completely died after 8 days.
"they were only used for phone calls so no loud music, no loud videos."
they were treated kindly when in use and in-between.
"i wish these were legit, but i recommend buying something else."
great gift idea.
noise cancelling and great sound.
will buy again
bought them awhile back and still use them now daily!
great quality for the money.
they come in a nice little case too.
love the rose gold color!
"for the first 2 weeks, they were ok, but then they suddenly stopped working."
it has a beautiful design and an amazing sound quality.
"even when on full volume, you can barely notice from the outside."
one of the best so far.
great quality for the price.
i recommend.
excellent sound.
these are the best earphones that i ever had.
it provides great bass and noise cancellation is a1.
"and the earphones are magnetic so they stick together, which is really cool."
"i love the color it is in rose gold, which is my favorite color."
the color is beautiful and it sounds amazingly great
one bud stopped working after 6 weeks.
they get the job done
super cute.  
nice little headphones
"this was an amazing product, i heard perfectly and i would easily turn it lower by a simple switch!"
the only thing i would say is that they fell out easily even with the smalest tips..
they were a great price and in the end i would defently buy it again!
great sound.
appealing style.
it’s ok
quite disappointed as one of the earbuds broke in 2 months.
"still plays sound, but half of the volume and the noise canceling is gone."
"they look very cool and professional but the sound quality is definitely true to the price, which is quite low."
cute color but falls out ears constantly.
all three pair broke within three days...
buyer beware!!
been using these for about 3 weeks straight.
came back to buy a pair for my mom.
only dislike is the mic is so far from my mouth
"so it’s an inconvienence while on the phone, but that’s not too serious."
"best headphones i've ever had, love the sound!"
daughter loves these
these headphones are absolutely amazing!
they work super great and work really well with both my google pixel and my mac.
they seem super durable and i don't think they will break ever especially since they have a protective barrier around the cord.
10/10 would recommend to anyone.
great
bought these for my daughter and one side there was no sound at all
good
they're ok.
they will do the job.
this is a great product for a great price.  
love the 12 month warranty and rose gold color.
i bought these ( 2 pair ) in match
and it's only the beginning of may and both sets have died!
these are great when they do work but the smallest tug ( accidental mind
you ) kills them don't want your money
i think these headphones are amazing and work extremely well.
the customer service is great and the shipping  is so fast!
love them!
lovvvvve
i got the headphones today and i used them right away.
the sound is great and i love the color.
i like that it comes with a little case.
i will definitely buy more in the future.
i absolutely love these headphones!
they are perfect!
they havr a beautiful color.
"i idioticly took the ear bud padding off, and lost it, so i will for sure order"
these ear buds again!
bomb.best headset eververy cutelouddddddddd as
i wanted it
to
becleari'm going to order
more 4 my daughters
the only reason this isn’t 5 stars is because the color of the cord isn’t as nice as the picture showed.
but i love the sound quality and how it fits my ears nicely.
"i love the quality of these earphones, i love how they have a magnet that keeps them together at the earpiece."
i would absolutely buy these earphones again.
these earphones are very affordable.
falls out of ears
they're pretty good headphones they just always fall out of my ears
and it's mad annoying.
i also changed the size of the ear piece and they still fall out.
i have had these for exactly one week today and the sound completely stopped working.
"i have not been rough on them, i only use plugged into my lap top sitting at my desk."
i guess you get what you pay for.
no problems.  
recommend it - great value and works great.  
also super cute pink color.
worked like a charm
rose gold is my new favorite color!!
"also, purchased in gold."
i really love the tin case they came in.
great storage for them when not in use.
pretty high quality for such a low price
", i've bought more expensive earbuds that were lower quality than these."
"they work very well, i highly recommend buying from this seller."
"bad sound quality, cute though"
"bad sound quality, cute though"
much better all around than i expected for price
they were good while they lasted- for the price you can't ask for them to last much longer than a month or two.
i did love the magnetic part of the earbud parts though!
i like the fact that i am able to hear either the person i'm talking to on my phone or the video/song
i'm playing and nothing else.
i can't hear anything that is going on around me.
are phones are okay could have been better
"works nice for the price, bass was actually nice, stay in your ears pretty good."
i use this at work.
it blocks out noises and the sound is good.
i have a cover on my phone
so the port connection is not good if you try to walk but
otherwise no complaints.
i like it.
i really like this product for the simple fact that they are nice and sturdy.
i can normally blow through headphones but these manged to last over 2 years
", that's why i reordered them."
i go through earphones pretty quickly
"so i was looking for an affordable but hopefully quality option and these are definitely it ,"
great sound and the pink color is really cute !!! (:
i bought these earphones without any high expectations and was genuinely surprised by how well these worked.
the only issue i have is that the earbuds sometimes don't stay in my ears.
as someone going to school i keep my earphones in my back pocket and the wires are so thin they just break off.
even if you accidentally get caught on something like a jacket and you pulled it
so it would get lose it would break
"when i put these on i can barely hear the outside, really good sound quality and they're beautiful!"
i am very happy with the head phone.
nice rose color shipping with the metal box.
they're good for the price
"good sound quality and the magnetic backs are really helpful for keeping the buds together, they look nice too."
they work perfect for my teen!!
"cheap, great quality and durable!!"
i am tired of buying earphones that do not last more than a few months.
love it
i love how i can adjust the volume
how ever i need to.
fine for hearing people talk and listening to music but poor outbound sound quality.
i like that the buds are magnetic and stick together but the overall quality is poor
i bought two of these earbuds.
the first set one speaker quit working within a week and the second has been good so far.
seem durable and the noise reduction works well.
"sound quality could be a bit better,  but for the price, they do their job!!"
it is to soon to write a review
but i love the color .
good for the price
and i like the case they came in
i had them for less than a month and they broke.
completely stopped working.
i took very good care of them
but they just stopped working one day
great comfortable headphones
i love them!
got them because i started going to the gym and they work perfectly :)
wet good for the price.
did a great job voiding out annoying co workers.
very nice presentation.
served its purpose very well.
would recommend.
when using the head phones on a telephone call the other party has a hard time hearing me.
microphone issues maybe....
the earphones are pretty
but definetely
they dont have a good sound quality
used the smallest size buds it came with and was perfect for my 8 year old.
came with small case perfect for school!
great product for the price!
"with a nice color to boot, these earpphones are pretty cheap and have good sound quality as well."
it comes with several plug sizes in case they dont fit and come with a very good warranty option
really good for phone calls i can hear everything perfectly.
the wires seem very durable and the magnets on the earbuds help prevent the wires from getting tangled!
ok
they fell apart the second time i used them
when i received the item.
"the left side ear piece, wiring was off.  "
it went in and out from working to completely not in 5 minutes.
i would save your money for something better quality.
they are cheaply made and not the best quality.
i love it because of the color
and it works very well.
it is so good for listening
", i use it almost all the time during the walking and in my office"
and it can help me keep the noise out completely.
i love the noise cancelling feature and the overall sound quality.
it reminds me of the quality of a pair of beats headphones.
like the sound quality.
it works for me .
color is nice .
works great with my android.
very satisfied.
these headphones sound horrible.
awesome
i just got  earbuds
",they look nice they work excellent"
this sounds is so clear
", i hope they will keep  longer."
works well!
really like these
i really like these earbuds.
they are nicely built and i especially love the case they come in.
the case keeps the earbuds from getting tangled and it pops right in my purse
perfect headphones that also have a great mic.
perfect for the gym and everyday use.
the packaging also have 2 ear buds for small and bigger eats
good quality for the price.
really great headphones.
sound is clear and has great volume.
i just love these new headphones.
they are amazing.
love the colour...
the noise canceling is amazing!
just love it!
sure was a good purchase!
☺
i bought these eadbuds because of the color
but i have been using them for 2 days and one of the earbuds isn't working.
really disapointed ....
the right earbud did not work.  
i then received a replacement and that pair was also defective.  
cute earbuds
but did not work.
they only last for one month and then one side stop working.
good quality and great sound!
love it
i never used product when i finally did decide to product was not working.
i just threw them away.
works great
i really like the magnetic back to the box
for the price not bad
i like that the earbuds do a great job of cancelling out the outside noise
and i like how the speaker is in the middle of the earbuds instead of one side
muy lindo!
viene exactamente como en la foto y se
escucha perfectamente!
"me encantó, pediré otro de regalo"
not strong
love these headphones!
the rose gold color is super cute and the fact that they are magnetic keeps them from getting tangled in my bag!
highly recommend!
i was worried it was damaging my ears because it would randomly send shocks
(like when your fingers have static) into my ears.
cheap material.
doesn’t last.
these are the longest lasting
ear buds
i have ever had!  
i have used them daily for a year and they work just as well as they did new.
"these are great headphones, and the price is unbeatable."
i love the clear sound
"these ear buds put out, great volume control etc etc!!!"
"amazing earbuds, holding up really well and they really do cancel noise well."
they worked amazingly for about a month then the wires must have gotten messed up and the pause and play button didn’t work on mine
i like the earphone magnetic quality and and very affordable.
so easy.
light and work perfectly
nice
"5 stars, the headphones are some of the best i've ever had!"
i love them.
there okay
i love these earbuds
they’re so awesome!!!
not great
received these and the sound quality is great for inexpensive ear buds.  
they are comfortable in my small ears
and i can wear them all day.
these earbuds are perfect.
the sound quality is great.
i love how i can just hear the music booming in my ears.
these headphones exceeds my expectation.
my daughter loves them!
i dislike how they are not durable
these are very disappointing.  
i wanted them for running.
they are constantly falling out of my ears
and i have to stop and put them back in.
these are very disappointing.  
i wanted them for running.
they are constantly falling out of my ears
and i have to stop and put them back in.
i love the sound is good!!!
stopped working 2 days after use
these are great headphones but they literally stopped working after a month and a half.
they are beautiful though
they work great sound great
the only thing i dont like is the ear pieces are not marked with left or right
started having audio problems the first day i used it
just having a hard time sometime for ear buds to stay in no matter the size.
my head phone does not work there is
know incoming or out going sound need a refund or a new headphone
they're good for listening to music
but they don't really cancel out sound
they also break pretty fast
llegó con un auricular dañado.
the sound is great.  
i like the case it comes in to help keep the cords orderly when not in use.
they sound really gold for the price.
color is very pretty.
my headphones stopped working after 3 days.
lots of static and then all of a sudden no sound in one earbud :(
i can hear people with music on
love how comfortable they are and the sound projection!
don't bother.
they worked exactly one time before crapping out.
"they worked really good for a couple weeks and then they just randomly stopped working, low quality."
"good design but one earbud doesn't work unless i twist the aux, makes static noises if my hand ever so touches the aux."
dont buy this product..
not worth it.
after having the item for a month the headphone don't work..
they stopped working a few weeks after purchase
"great earphones work well with my phone and tablet, arrived quickly!"
this were the best purchase!!!
highly recommend!
i love them!
highly reccomend for anybody who wants a nice paid of good quality sound headphones.
i love these they are very good quality and sound amazing
i love that it bring its own case and that they are magnetic.
great headphones beautiful color ❤
i love it
"i liked them overall, but one of ear buds stopped working after 5 months"
i like that is has
a micro phone and the ear buds are magnetic so they cling together.
this has amazing quality for the price i paid for the product.
the sound is great and the earphones look great as well.
would recommend to many!
loved the magnet.
works well.
these look pretty good.
just got em outa da box.
writing a review
so i can get the bogo deal.
so far so good.
already bought 2 pairs and the same problem they dont work after a couple of months
"good design, good quality and great customer service!!!"
i like the magnet part
it’s helpful when putting away
"daughters headphones worked for one week, then failed.  "
sending back for refund
poor durability...shortage in the connector...
this is my 2nd pair
color nice and tone nice and megnetic
it’s keeps going in out
they came in a great tiny tin which i love !
i want like 1 more pair for my daughter lol
great sound quality.
one earbud makes a crinkling noise when adjusting while in ear.
i bought these headphones and they completely ceased working within three days.
do not buy.
"the noise cancellation on these earbuds is great, and i liked how the backs of the earbuds are magnetic."
work well.
comfortable.
i like them.
they work very well.
they definitely are noise canceling earbuds
but they didn't last for very long
they have amazing sound
and i love the color
loved this product.
the rose gold is really pretty and the sound quality is great!
i love them already and the case it came in is perfect
"for the price of the value, it’s worth it."
very well made.
3 months later one side has completely stopped working.
gotta say for the price these are pretty good.
definitely recommend!
the packaging was really nice and the sound quality is really nice.
all is ok
just the right one works
the left ear bud stopped working literally tge
same day i got it.
"so durable, i love them"
"magnetic earbud, great, easy to use, durable"
best ear buds i have had and at a great price.
i love the magnets and sound quality is great!
this product doesn't knot easily and brings you the sound you're looking for!
as soon as i plugged them in it was all static
just what i needed.
the quality looks really good and the color is gorgeous
it bothers my ears when i use it.
very bad quality!
good for casual listening.
used for listening to audiobooks.
"the color ( rose gold), the sound and the case"
great quality!
the sound is great!
daughter loves these headphones
great quality !
love the color and love the sound quality!
they stopped working a week after they were purchased.
i honestly expected better quality out of these massively disappointed
i love the color!
came right on time and are very good quality for such a good price!
cheap.
bad sound quality.
bad design.
bad everything.
arrived fast n looked great.
i like how it sounded.
i really like the color of the headphones
and they stayed in while running
worth the money.
good quality and works perfectly.
good sound quality especially for the price.
the wires are thin  which is itsonly problem.
just what i expected!  
"love the color,  the sound is great !"
very cute and durable
sound quality good overall nice
me encantó lindo
works great with my laptop will be purchasing again
"i love the case, and the fact that the earbuds are magnetic."
they are so awesome and cute
the magnet part and sound are my favorite
"these were doing fine, and then all of a sudden, they stopped working."
not worth it
"open the package, plug them in and......"
they sold me head phones
that don't work.
figured
the price was too good to be true.
i love the product.
it as the right amount of bass and the metal is very durable.
it's an amazing earphone
waste of money
it was really durable and the sound is really good.
i would recommend
super cute headphone wanting to get a pair for my boyfriend now
really nice headphones
the cord is to thin
great headphones
"this earphone broke in 2 days, faster than a $1 earphone."
love the headphones.
honestly my favorite ones by far.
i love it!!!

great product
great product
good prodauct
great for price and has warranty
quality good
good quality headphones; however immediately after opening the spare earbud bag (the little baggy which includes the large and small sized earbuds)
i noticed that one of the small earbuds had already been torn.
the normal and large sized ear buds were in good condition though.
"i don't yet know how durable the whole headphone set itself is, but it seems alright."
"the shape of the headphones is a little odd though for my small ears, i would probably go for something more like my previous pair next time (second image on the left)"
but that isn't included in my rating since that's just something i should have thought about when i ordered these.
update: one day into wearing these
"and i made my first few phone calls and people were complaining at the amount of background noise through the microphone, which is also placed a little inconveniently further down the cord than my previous pair of a different brand."
my previous pair of earbuds also did a much better job at muting background noise and did a better job at isolating up my voice.
great ear buds
excellent headphones!
excellent headphones!
"when i first bought these, i thought they were great quality for the price that i paid."
i really liked the volume adjuster
and i thought the magnetic aspect was pretty cool.
but i bought these in december and 2 weeks ago
one of the earbuds already is at half volume.
i have to angle the wires a certain way just to be able to hear through both sides.
unfortunately not worth it and will probably invest in a better quality pair.
"worst ever, didn’t work from the beginning of opening the box."
all you hear is static.
"i received the headphones in late august and was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality that they provided, for the price."
"they are fairly comfortable, i do have to adjust them when jostled or moving quickly, but that's to be expected from the shape of the earpiece."
"however, this week they have gone severely downhill."
there's a crackling noise during playback
"(i checked all ports and wires and it's not an obvious connection issue), and the volume has started lowering itself for no apparent reason."
"for the price i didn't expect them to be amazing, but i did expect more than 2 months of use."
"i only wear them for my commute, about an hour a day total."
"i bought these for phone calls, based on the reviews here and how everyone raved about the sound."
"yes, the sound is great."
but the microphone is so far away from my mouth/
"the cord is so long, that no one can hear me talk!"
"and no, i'm not going to hold the wire close to my mouth..."
what's the point of that?
"so, for $7.99, they will sit in a drawer of my desk."
lame.

"these headphones ha e great sound quality, durability, and noise cancellation, however i hate how they fit."
"i don’t know what it is, but all three of the bud replacements fit poorly in my ear."
"i typically have to wear the smallest adjustment because i have narrow openings, but even that was too big."
the wire is also having a rough time straightening out.
"i was hoping that the cord would relax after a few hours of use, but it’s been over a month and it still curls up weird."
"i don’t know why, but it’s super annoying."
i bought them to workout with
but it’s actually distracting.
i purchased 2 pair for christmas.
one pair is still working well.
the sound quality is decent.
they're smaller and they fit in my daughters
ears well.
she often has a hard time finding ear buds that stay in.
"unfortunately, the second pair is not functioning."
sound only comes out of one ear bud.
"so after a month of use, they were no good :(both girls really liked the rose gold color."
so did i. i just wish both pair were still working.
great noise canceling and great bass retention.
comfortable to use and very sturdy!
i ordered the gold/black version and hope they have it available again soon.
update:
"these headphones are actually superb, i just think some part in the wiring that made one side go out , not to sure where since i only got to use them a second time before they went out shortly after about 7 minutes."
will give them another try.
"worked perfectly for about 2 weeks, and then one side started blowing out."
"i taped them to try and fix the one side, and then the other blew out too."
"they were good quality until they stopped working, but definitely not good for the long haul."
sound is good but uneven.
one side gets twice the sound as the other.
i just bought this and tried it for the first time
and it is very loud.
no distortion and the base is perfect.
hopefully it will last me a long time because i have no luck with earphones
i liked everything about this product.
it is so good.
i would definately recommend this!
trust me you will not be disappointed!
really good headphones high quality and cheap
"♥ i recently broke a pair of earbuds, so i had to find a different pair to use."
i search for the cheapest option & these popped up.
"at first, i was hesitant because of the very low price."
i wasn't sure of what kind of quality to expect.
"when they arrived, i was blown away!"
the earbuds themselves provide outstanding audio and came in an amazing condition!
the packaging was a nice surprise as well.
it came with extra buds & a free warranty offer.
"i use earbuds many hours throughout the day, so i will definitely purchase more of these in the future, but i have a feeling that these earbuds will last me a very long time."
love them!
♥
so happy with these given the price.
my kids go through earbuds constantly
and i wanted to find some that sound good but
aren't spendy.
these fit the bill.
i'm impressed by the quality in sound and they even look really nice in person.
"it looks like they've gone up in price since i purchased, but i still think they are worth the money."
time will tell if these hold up (and can survive teenagers)
but i'm buying several because the price combined with the quality can't be beat.
the product is great for what i need it for.
"it's loud which is great, the bass isn't the best"
but they're not high end
so no big deal.
"i did have an issue with the silicone tips that came with these earbuds, they didn't fit well in my ear and kept falling out and that's with all 3 sizes that came with it,"
but i had spare earbud tips from an old pair
and i just used those instead and they fit well after that.
"(also, i'm a bit dumb because at first, i thought they didn't work after plugging them into a few devices, but"
my silly mistake because the volume rocker was all the way down which is why i couldn't hear anything at first lmao)
"i usually go through a lot of headphones, and i think these are my favorites."
"i'm not an audiophile and mostly listen to podcasts, so i'm not the best judge of sound quality, but i have no complaints in that regard"
- everything sounds nice and clear.
the magnetic feature is really nice because i usually listen with one earbud in
and it's nice not to have the other one hanging down.
"i also like that the two headphones are connected at the volume control/mic area, which means if somewhere down the line"
"one of the buds does die, i can just cut it off and expect the other to keep working."
i also really appreciate having the pause and volume control buttons so easily accessible -
i like that the volume control changes the headphone volume without changing the device volume
"- it's a really nice feature on airplanes, because when you're watching a movie at normal volume the announcements blast your eardrums, but with this feature, you can turn the volume to max on the little airplane screen, turn down the volume on the earbuds, and hear the announcements at a reasonable volume."
"i've had them for two months and they're going strong, which is actually saying something considering i sleep with an earbud in"
"so i'm always getting tangled in wires and dropping them, so"
my headphones don't usually last long.
i love these ear buds.
i got these because i had bought my daughter a pair
and she seemed to like them.
i needed something to be able to listen to my baseball games when i go for my walk everyday!
amazing and so loud!
and they really seem to last!
pretty sure my daughter's pair has been washed in the washing machine a bunch of time!
i bought these because my old headphones broke.
i wanted a cheap pair that still worked well.
i was going to go for some other ones but the rose gold of these headphones caught my eye.
i also thought the magnetic backs was a cool feature.
i was worried because of the cheap cost
but i'm glad i got them.
"the seem sturdy, the rose gold is very pretty, and the sound quality is good!"
the base quality surprised me.
the only one issue i have with them is that the mic is pretty low
but i just flip one headphone over my shoulder and it raises the mic.
"other than that, it's a solid pair of headphones!"
"i was initially surprised that for this price i could have a moderately decent pair of headphones for my commute, as i'm generally pretty forgetful about headphones in general"
so i generally purchase cheaper throw-away pairs.
not even worth the expense though!
the right earbud was out in 3 days.
each earbud takes turns on which one is going to go out of commission.
and the return policy on these is conditional
(you have to drop it off at an amazon locker) which for me is an hour away.
that's the only pro i can think of for these.
as for the cons:~there is no bass.
"just a muffled sound~don't stay in the ears very well, no matter what size earbud tip is used~"
magnet gimmick is annoying~
no 'l' or 'r' stamps to indicate which bud goes in what ear
~what's the point of volume control if you can't control said
volume well?~haven't had these a good month before losing sound in what i assume is the right
budwait.
i did manage to think of one more pro:~they're an excellent reminder of why cheap isn't always better.
standard ear plugs that comes with 3 different size rubber ear pieces to fit your ear canal.
the ear buds have magnets
so they stick together to prevent from getting too tangle up.
"the volume button on the little remote is pretty much because it can only increase the volume by 2 bars, might as well use the phone's volume button."
"i just got mine today, so far it looks and feel durable."
"update 5/13/2019:2/3 months after using it, it finally crapped out."
one of the ear piece doesnt work anymore.
i had to tape it a certain way to make both ear buds work.
"save your money, dont waste it on this one"
i listen to talk radio all night when i go to bed.  
the sound quality is so clear and crisp.  
adjusting the volume is easy as i can feel the volume control without having to look at it.  
i will be ordering a couple more.  
i like to have a pair in my handbag
should i be out and want to listen to music/video while in public without being a distraction to others.  
i would most definitely recommend these earbuds to my friends.
i had another pair of these for the office
"and i think they made it a year or so before one side gave out, which is a great lifespan for earbuds at this price range."
so i'm buying a replacement in the pink.
they came and are very shiney
so i like that.
it's nice to have a volume controller on the cord.
these headphones are 1.
super cute and 2.
not bad quality for the price.
i'm not a huge fan of in ear headphones
but these are super comfortable and i love that they came in a little case!
perfect because then they won't get tangled in my purse.
"i also like how the back is magnetic and you can stick them together, just a cool little feature."
"i'm in chicago and it's winter now, so i get zapped with static electricity daily,"
"but i didn't make the ""metal = conducts electricity"" connection until i wore them to run.  "
getting zapped inside your ear sucks!
i switched back to my old headphones for running and hope i'll be able to use these in the summer.  
they're very cute!
loved that the cord didn't get tangled and the magnetic buds help keep things organized.
matches perfectly with my iphone in rose gold.
perfect price - $7.99 but worth much more.
great sound quality - music and phone calls are clear and the volume control is very convenient.
was hoping for better sound cancellation but other than that i highly recommend!
shipping was late
but it was usps's fault as my mail carrier is incompetent.
"but when i finally did receive them and tried them out, i really enjoy them!"
"great sound and bass, noise cancelation is good and i love the pretty rose gold color!"
also they're at a price you just can't beat!
"hit the 'buy' button, you won't regret it!"
these were a christmas gift for my teenage daughter.
she absolutely loved them right up until a week ago when one of the earbuds quit working.  
the sound quality was impressive when both earbuds worked and the noise canceling was adequate.
durability is where they fall short only lasting about a month and a half.
they are good for the price.
they don't stay in if you're tumbling or running.
they do fine for jogging.
the magnet that holds them together is very weak.
the color is cute.
i love the toggle switch for the volume.
they're great for the price.
not the best headphones ever but
they're decent for the money.
these ear buds are pretty great for the price.
"they came in a nice little case and they sound pretty decent, also the ends of them are magnetic"
which i thought was pretty neat.
these are low priced headphones
so don’t expect crystal clear sound quality.
my only complaint would be that the mic is really low
it comes down past my chest
i wish that the placement would be higher up.
works great.
been using them since aug 2018 and still work great.
i leave them at my desk at work and soley use them at my desk.
my only concern is that they sometimes shock me.
like a light shock on my ear.
i would otherwise give a 5 star.
i have multiple wired headphones because i want to make sure they last and do not take the constant rolling and scuffle.
it is a shame this headphones stopped working after two months.
aesthetically is beautiful functionally is waste of money and time.
i do not recommend.
if you answer yes then buy these.  
"they are very attractive, match a rose gold phone or mp3 player perfectly."
good sound and value priced.  
the sound is as good as any other earbuds i have ever tried.  
they also come packaged in a nice useful tin you can use to protect them while carrying them around.
these headphones are great.
i usually prefer in-ear headphones for the gym or long walks and these work perfectly.
"my only complaint is that the earplugs are not really tailored with l and r sides, however, they do not fall out and that is the most important test for a good pair of in-ear headphones."
i needed a set of wired earphones for a overseas trip because my wireless buds just wouldn't have enough charge for the flight.
"i found these and was skeptical of the reviews, but i figured, it's not a bad price for two"
"and if they aren't great, i'll just toss 'em."
nope.
"for ""cheapies,"" these little buggers are surprisingly good."
they have lows and highs like a bass singer with an 80's hairdo and the magnetic feature to them from casually dropping off your neck
is just like my aunt's thighs - they stick together.
buy with confidence.
i love these ear buds.
they're a little big for my tiny ears even with the smallest pad
but i'm use to that.
the sound quality is amazing!
i love the bass and when my volume is up
and i've got them pushed in all the way i can't hear anything else.
the color is so cute too
and i keep them in the case when not using them.
my jack bent a little
but it still works fine.
so far these are working out great.
"i love that the ear pieces have magnets so they don’t get tangled!edit add: ordered on sept 5, it's now nov 25."
used daily to watch hulu & netflix.
i take care of my ear buds
"so no tangles, i don't bunch them, wrap them, etc....."
and already cannot hear out of one ear piece.
i have to jiggle wire and hope to hit right spot.
these headphones have great sound quality and noise cancellation.
my daughter wears them to drown out the loud kids on the school bus.
she didn’t use them to workout
so i’m not sure how they stack up to that.
i love these earphones in pink.
the sound quality is great and they really do cancel out noise.
i wish the mic worked better  though.
when making calls it picks up a lot of static and background noise.

"these are the worst, most uncomfortable ear buds i have ever bought."
i don't think i have had them 6 weeks.
i can't hear a darn thing with them except static.
the only thing i like about them is the color.
absolute waste.
really happy with these.
they're cute and came with 3 different sized ear buds so you can fit it to your ears.
sound quality is as god as can be expected for cheap ear buds.
"it also comes in a little tin, which i really appreciate because it keeps the wires from tangling up in my purse!"
it works well with my computer and the color is really cute.
but once i use it with my phone the noise comes out of my phone's speaker and not the headphones.
so they somewhat work.
these come with 3 different size earbuds which is awesome because i use the smallest size.
i only use one ear
bud
"so i can hear out for my kids, but i can bearly hear my husband when he talks to me"
"and i have these in,"
so that's a major plus.
definitely noise cancelling which is fantastic.
especially at this price range.
worked for several months but eventually broke.
the sound was fairly decent & loved the rose gold.
decent for being wired & the price
"i bought these for my daughter, i know the noise cancelling works because she never hears me yelling for her lol."
"pretty rose gold color, great sound as well."
used these buds for the first time and the level adjustment doesnt work and it broke.
the buds shock my ears when i move.
only think i like is the color.
not worth the money.
i bought my you first pair 4 months ago
and they’re still going strong!
the sound is good enough.
the mic works well.
no other cheap headphones have ever lasted this long for me.
i will continue to get these!
love these they work very well for the price and came with a few extra ear piece covers...
this was a great purchase and a steal
the color was pretty
i gave them his gifts
they really seem to like them they’re still using them at six or eight months later.
i bought these so as not to disturb my partner while watching my movies in bed on my laptop.  
they do not disturb him!!  
he cannot hear them.
they worked pretty good for about a week or so.
i have bought two pairs thinking maybe the first one was defective both have stoped working!
"the color is really nice, the noise cancellation umm"
it's not that great
but it's fine for when i use it which is at work.
i would definitely buy another one if i have to.
they look and sound great.
they're also comfortable and come in handy for working out.
i'm happy and highly recommend!
"they came in a little tin box, which is great because my cats chew cords."
the ends are magnetic so they stay together when not in use.
sooo wonderful.
don't know about noise
cancelling b
/c
i just use one in when at work etc.
terrible.
they mess with my phone and press keys.
keeps turning on google assistant.
bad sound quality.
my daughter loves.
not sure if just for looks or based on sound but
either way she's a happy camper
i like the little volume control slider and the color.
i like the shiny look too.
i have trouble getting them to stay in my ears
tho
and i can't hear the base in the music very well.
these headphones are so cute!!
they are beautiful and the wire is like sort of pearly.
"they have a pause and volume setting button, but what i love most is that you don’t have to worry about them falling by they  immediately"
just magnet together
our daughter uses them whenever her bluetooth headphones need charging.  
the sound is excellent and the noise cancellation works really well.
i found these to be very comfortable.  
"i use them while on the treadmill and when i want hear music at home, and my family has their own music."
great value and nice rose gold (pink) color.
i use it everyday and seems very durable.
sound is great.
these are good quality and good lokking earbuds.
good sound.
i like the magnet feature.
the sound control piece is great and it works for my kindle fire unlike other earbuds
i use these for listening to music/watching youtube videos.
"it’s good but not durable, if the cord is twisted, even in the slightest, there is static."
i would buy again because the price is amazing.
i really enjoy using these earphones.
the noise cancellation does what it is supposed to do.
the sound quality is loud and clear.
these are pretty legit.
"the sound is loud and clear, on par with my favorite panasonic's.  "
"these were shockingly inexpensive for the quality, plus they are really pretty"
okay product.
"not super durable, the jack started to bend after a bit"
worked fine with some devices but did not for intended use with xbox one controller.
i loved the magnet on them.
the sound is pretty high quality.
also it doesn't fall out of my ears as much as other headphones i have had in the past.
"it has a very good sound quality, when it worked."
"however, one of the ear pieces stopped working within a couple of weeks with very gentle use."
my 11 year old grandaughter loves these.
"she had more than several different kinds, but these she loves."
"pros: cute, nice looking, and the magnetic buds are handycons: constant background noise, like an old tv buzzing."
it makes my ears itch.
"i love them, they’re so cute!"
and thanks for the tin and extra ear
bud pieces!
"just as describe love them, they also come in a little box"
so that makes it easier for me to put them away and not lose them
one side quit working not long after getting them
stoped working a few days after return window  closed.
love these ear buds.
this is my third set.
"have them at work, in my car and gym bag."
great sound
and they don’t fall out of my ears!
i like the pretty color rose gold!
loud and clear sounding earbuds.
comes with a 2 pair set of replacement jellies to fit your comfort size
"these are too big, they fall out of everyone’s ears."
we think it is funny.
you get what you pay for.
they kept slipping out of my ear on the long flight.
"they look sharp, and when they stay in they are mostly noise cancelling."
"the sound started cracking within a week, they already don't function at some angles."
the sound quality on these earbuds is amazing!
"they work very well, not to mention that the color is great too."
they were/work fine
i think it's just my phone destroyed them
"i especially love the magnetic earbuds, they stick together and make it hard to tangle the wires!"
very pretty color as well.
i needed an earphones just for gym and this one is perfect for me.
i really love the pink color and the sound is perfect too.
also the head pieces were magnets
so it’s easy
to untangle l.
overall i love it!
they stopped working after a couple weeks.
"plugged them in one morning and could only hear the background music, the singing was very, very quiet."
broke after 3 weeks.
disappointed.
for the price these are a great buy.  
very cute and work well.
very good for travel
"i bought it for my daughter to use at school , she love it, thank you"
fit in ear perfectly and sound quality
is great
"really love these, will purchase a backup pair just in case amazon runs out of stock."
hard for me to find good ear buds.
"works great, i love them"
i love the pink salmon color and it was a simple buy
.. works as it should
"great for the price, use every day at work!"
would recommend.
it comes with a a nice storable case and
the magnetic earbuds make it easier to handle.
im surprised by how great the sound is for such a good price :)
i love these.
they don't make my ears hurt.
great sound.
good quality for the price!
sturdy not flimsey.
love the color💞
💞💞
🤗as well as
the tin can holder they came with😊
these headphones were purchased for my daughter and she loves them.  
they have held up well so far and have great sound.  
if i have any issues i will update this review.
i liked how the product was noise cancelling and had it's own volume control on it.
good
"the sound on these is pretty good, especially for the price."
"very stylish, too."
cute color and stylish
i love the bass & clear singing to the music.
waste of money.
broke in two weeks
one of the buds stopped working less than a week!
you get what you pay for.
stereo failed in 1.5 months.
like the magnetized ends so buds don't smash into each other in transport.
love it
cord headphones are not really good for workouts.
this is my second time ordering these headphones.
they are great and last for a while.
nice package but  sound get lost sometimes but loud volume
"used them for 4 days now, right side no longer works."
"the more i'm forced to use these, the more i realize how awful they are."
good quality
daughter liked them a lot
"the cord is a little shorter than what i'm used to, and i can't tell whether or not they're surround sound, but they do the job."
first time owning this product.
i'm extremely pleased with the ease of use and the sound quality.
would purchase this one again.

great color
better than i expected honestly
cómodos
these are not comfortable.
cute but won't stay in ear.
sounds great and fit my ears good.
couple of usage
and then they're not working anymore.
decent for the price
they are nice head phones but can't songs with them
love the rose gold!
sound quality was not good and they have an awkward fit.
inexpensive price for the quality.
they sound great and are comfortable to wear.
i will buy them again as gifts.
good enough for my desk at work
very good!!
falls out sometimes so not the best but for working out maybe?
i love these!
they're loud and have bass.
they're perfect.
"they were for my daughter, she loves them!"
they were terrible quality and not loud at all.
i had to have my volume all the way up
and i still couldnt hear it that well.
definitely not noise cancelling in anyway.
they also broke completely in less than a week.
waste of money.
these didn't fit in my ears at all.  
they fell out
anytime i turned my head the wrong way.
i ended returning them.
i have used a top brand for over a year needed something for work and yhese are by far the best ever!!
will order again
"i use these at work and they work really well, great at blocking out sound"
worth every penny
and it got here fast.
thank you!
great quality at an affordable price.
"edit: after a week of daily use, there is no sound from one earbud."
quality product.
you must have the gadget that your iphone needs
otherwise they are not usable
one side quit working
i love the way they sound.
they stay in my ears perfect.
rose gold color is dead on.
match my phone case!!
"i have no dislike ,the sound is great"
and i dont have to turn it up loud
either i just love my headphones...
absolute crap product..
love these headphones.  
especially the color of them.
the sound is great too!
broke easily.
the headphones arrived not even working.
the sound quality was muffled and distorted.
"they will get old eventually but when they do, i always buy the same pair, same color"
love the quality and design.
worth the buy
great quality at a low price.
very good.
pretty color
they are decent for the prize.
i like the color though.
great product and very durable.
good headphones its worth the money
earbuds do the job for the price really nice
very good for the price.
exceeded expectationd
"if two stars means ""i don't like it"", then this is a true 2-star for me."
my review stems from the earbuds which will not stay in my ears unless i hold them with my hands.
i plugged in to check the sound
"and it was good, though there was no noise cancelling to speak of."
they come with little rubber pieces in various sizes which i swapped out for the smallest ones.
this didn't help.
"for my test and to keep the ear buds in i had to hold in place with my hands, quite the opposite of hands-free."
i didn't bother to place a call.
i'm sure the sound is fine
but i don't want to have to hold the microphone to my mouth.
because these weren't expensive i won't be returning them
and so these will sit with my other unused and unreturnable gadgets.
if i ever lose all the other plugged earbuds i own
i could still use these in a pinch provided all i want to do is sit perfectly still or use both hands to hold the buds in place.
"if you don't have wonky or small ear openings, these would be quite good."
"lovely, flexible and comfortable!"
love it!
very nice headphones
i've had these for a month.
"after one month of regular use,  they are no longer working properly."
i'm so disappointed.
i really wanted them to keep working well!  
the color is really nice and the noise cancellation is noticeably good.  
"or rather i don't notice what's going on around me, which is excellent if you want to drown out a noisy waiting room,  airport,  or concentrate on something.  "
"they worked really well,  at first, and slowly the sound quality has diminished."
there's a crackling now in one headphone and most recently the microphone button started going nuts.  
i'll have the headphones on and
"the slightest movement by me will crank the volume,  switch a song,  change the sound source,  and even send me to another video.  "
this makes it pretty hard to wear them and work out!  
save your money and get a better pair.
"if you want something extra ordinary then go to this amazing product , i love the tast it is not very sweet"
"you will enjoy every bite as i did , seller was super helpful in listing all the ingredients  "
and they are as follow:
"product name tokyo banana ""look"

i bought 3 of these when i saw them.  
1 for myself & 2 for my daughters.  
not being a skeptic & also not sure how it was going to work - i optomistically put it on and started wearing it.  
i energized it once a day either in sunlight or running it under cold water for 3  minutes each day.
i didn't have the vivid dreams that people say they experience
"but i can report that after a couple of days, i was feeling much calmer - less anxious and more at peace."
still not sure how this works
but i can assure you it does!  
both of my daughters report the same positive effects.
i bought 3 of the flow style & they went back & also purchased the ground.
i fly fish often and was growing tired of using tapered monofilament leaders that are expensive.  
sometimes i would go through a 3 pack of leaders in less than a week.  
at that rate buying one of these leaders is worth it
plus i can reuse this one for a longer period of time.  
this leader has no memory which means it doesn't coil so
your casts land where you want them to go and your not untangling a mess of monofilament.  
this leader will cast as delicate as you want and in any place you want.  
"i will be buying these again whenever i need one, which may not be any time soon because these leaders are made to last.  "
great product and fast shipping.
update:  
almost a year later
and i am still using the same leader.  
i have caught over one hundred fish on this leader and it still casts great and is holding up well.  
i only had to change the tippet material every so often which is unavoidable but this product is the best leader i have ever used.  
can't wait to see how it holds up to another full year of fishing.
update:  
i went out fishing the other day
and i unpacked my reel which i had left the furled leader on all winter.  
once i started casting this leader straightened out like new.  
such a great product.  
"these are great at this size for throwing poppers, larger streamers and terrestrial or weighted flies."
i have been using this collector for 6 months now and there is a tremendous amount of heat collected from the sun.
i may purchase another panel to help heat the whole house.
"i am heating the whole house with it now and without a storage tank and just a heat exchanger, it puts heat into the basement floor under slab tubing and main floor radiators, but i cannot collect 100% of the heat it puts out during the day."
i will be installing a storage tank
so i can make the most of the day time sun.
great item.
super cute gift for that weapon enthusiast in your life.
i got the grenade for my ex and he looks pretty manly carrying it around.
almost makes me want to get back together with him.
"but no, that'd be a bad idea."
these lights work fine.  
"when people have trouble with cheap lights like this one, it's got nothing to do with the bulbs.  "
"usually, the headlights simply need adjusted.  "
"on most cars, you can do this by turning a small metal knob right next to where you insert the bulb."
"the best way to do it is to pull your car up at night on a flat surface, pointing at a wall that clearly shows where your headlights are aiming.  "
"just turn the knob to the left or right, and you'll see your headlights begin to raise or lower their angle.  "
"once they are both level and pointing to the proper height, you're done."
"in the past i have used cold bluing, kg products, brownells and durocoat."
i thought i would give this a try since no heat or baking was required.
"they key steps are to prep metal correctly, surface must have a small amount of ""roughness"" for perma-fin to adhere to."
"i sanded a barrel and an air tube in one direction only starting with 220 , then, 320 and finishing up with 400 grit wet 'n dry sandpaer."
"clean metal with acetone, denatured alcohol type solvents."
"hang it up somewhere to paint, you can't touch it while it cures between coats."
the dry time was much faster than directions specified and i recoated in 60 minutes.
better to have several fine coats than any thick ones.
clean up any sags or runs with a clean wet rag immediately before it sets up.
this is a brief review but the most important thing is to shake it very well and then strain it through a paint type funnel or screen.
"birchwood casey advises not to, but after many frustrating attempts and reading reviews online where people were blaming cheap air brush setups, there was always particles in the bottom of the paint jar."
"after straining through a piece of cheesecloth no less, the results were spectacular."
let hand overnight and in the morning i had an unbelievably hard semi gloss black finish.
"ok, so it shares one characteristic with a fanny-pack; you wear it around your waist with a cinched belt like a fanny-pack."
"thankfully, that is where the similarities stop."
this pack is like a mini sports backpack for your waist!
"it's broad size feels comfortable on my back, and the large main zippered pocket is large and spacious."
"i stuffed it with my adventure one medical kit, an emergency tent, an emergency blanket, a knife, flint and steel, a compass and an emergency mirror."
"amazingly, it still has room for more, yet is small enough to not take up too much room on my waist."
"it has a mesh outer pocket for storing additional items, but i have yet to use this handy little additional pocket."
the pack also comes with two water bottles that rest in holders on either side of the pack.
these are full-size bicycle -style water bottles; more than enough water for a long hike!
"because it is a dual-bottle pack, the weight is distributed evenly."
"the trick is to drink from both bottles; if you drink one until it is gone, the pack may begin to seem unbalanced."
"on a long day of hiking, this can get irksome."
"the solution is to alternate bottles when drinking; a simple, yet effective method of pack weight distribution use."
"as an office supply junkie (and an english teacher), i have gone through a lot of planners over the years, but i have been purchasing this particular type for almost ten years now.  "
i love them!!!  
"i like how each day has enough space to write anything you want to, and you're not burdened by having unused features, such as the hourly appointments that some day planners like to use."
"additionally, this planner is sturdy feeling, and i love how i can keep it closed by using the elastic strap.  "
(you could also use it to mark your place on a certain page.)  
"each year, the company offers unique patterns, and it's fun to pick out a new one."
"if you're looking for a unique, flexible, beautiful, and inexpensive planner, you will love this style!"
bought 4 in 1/2016.  
"today when trying to reset them to white, they all flashed in unison and now are locked on red.  "
none of them respond to either of two remotes.  
is this a feature?  
maybe they have a lock function
"and i don't know how to unlock them, but until something changes, my hallway is its own red light district."
"update 11/2016, ulincos direct responded by e-mail, said that the light lost connection with the remote, and told me how to fix it:1."
install the bulbs by screwing them to socket & choose a zone to assign it to2.
turn off the power supply of the bulbs for 10 seconds(either by main switch or unplug)3.
"turn the light back on & quickly press the ""zone on"" button on remote for designated zone within 3 seconds4."
the bulbs will blink 3 times if the link is set up successfullyit worked fine.  
thanks for the support!
the tornado 7 packs a big punch for the price.  
i paid just under $400 for the pair from off the grid sound & lighting.  
"each function works, and the 10w leds are very bright.  "
"the stepper motor is a little bit jerky, but barely noticeable.  "
"for $200/fixture, what do you expect?  "
"each function you select on the menu takes 7-8 seconds to take effect, so don't get discouraged when you select something"
and the light doesn't respond rite away.
"each light came with a mounting bracket, easy to read instructions & an ac power cord."
overall i'm satisfied with my purchase and plan to add 2-6 more to my lighting inventory.
very nice.  
heavy weight.  
sharp and durable
excellent quality and beautiful pendant.
"i know it's ""flow,"" but i feel more grounded when i wear it."
"can't tell you about having more lucid dreams as i haven't slept with it on...not sure that would be the smartest, safest thing to try."
loved it!
this was the best price i could find for the 4 packs of tokyo banana.
i was told they would arrive in august
but they came in a week and a half later.
they were absolutely delicious and well packed!
i am so happy right now eating my tokyo banana.
would definitely buy again.
we installed 16 of these 165 watt lights to replace twelve legacy t12 fixtures.  
we went from a measured 115 lux at the floor to 750-850 lux at the floor.  
"the actual measured power consumption was 150w, not 165w.  "
i've attached before an after photos showing the difference that 650% more light makes.
looks great.
"assembly was about 2.5 hours, instructions were good but you need to just not skip steps."
consistent size and smooth.
a stray shot hit wood and broke the ball; that's good because i bought this for inside shooting and don't want to damage my home like steel balls would.
but they can crack blinds made of plastic and put pits in drywall (without breaking the ball).
"yes, i'm new to slingshots."
i have received many compliments on how well this que shoots buy professional pool players.
this cue is perfect.
it feels great and was completely ready to use upon receipt.
the craftsman ship was beautiful and it is very straight and well made.
we love this so much we are going to get another one for my fiance.
i highly recommend this product.
"if you enjoy playing pool and want a great cue, then players is the way to go."
it feels great when i shoot and just the right weight.  
i love how it has a female finesse
but it isn't to much.
looks professional and professionals have complimented the quality while testing it out.
"great price, great cue."
i love it so much
i look for any opportunity to shoot some pool!
the knife is pretty decent i have used it to baton some wood and try to do feather sticks.
"i will admitt  that i have to work with it more to really get the results i want, and"
i don't mean with the edge
i mean me using the knife in general.
when we was batoning with it one time some of the coating chipped off which left me stumped because mykel hawke said in a video that they beat on thing with a hammer and the coating was fine and all i used was a piece of wood.
overall i like the feel of the knife and think that it can be used for both survival/bushcraft as well tactical applications.

the location of two ceiling fans in our.  
house made it very dificult to utilize the pull chains.  
one fan is above our bed and the other above the kitchen table.  
the chain pulls that came with both fans were always too short.
"today, i replaced all the former pull chains with the new ones.  "
they work perfectly.  
the chains are long enough and the colors i was able to choose from were ample.  
i chose the beige.  
the gold accents are a very pretty touch.
so nice!!
i love that there are no lines so i can write as big as i see fit for the day!
very clean set up.
absolutely beautiful cover with embossed type design.
the colors actually pop off of the cover!
love love love it.
perfect size for any bag also.
and the price is fantastic!
"and it lays flat without spiral binding, so your hand won't run against anything when you are filling out."
"fit great, but watch the size you order, i was xxl"
and i am 5ft8 190lbs.
"but that said, it is a perfect fit, i like it, still cold but"
when i hit the lanes and such i will come back.
"this is a great frisbee for the wind especially, the weight of this disc enables it to slice through the wind better the most of the other frisbees..."
this disc was an excellent buy as well...
i am impressed with the 200g disc as this is the first one i have actually purchased and thrown...
i am a huge fan of the innova super nova
180g disc..
i was surprised of the way this disc handled the wind great job
wham-o..
i buy one every year.  
it's the perfect size for my desk at the office.  
"squares are large enough to write appointments, reminders, whatever."
"you can see the entire month, not just one week.  "
large enough to stay open but doesn't take up much room on my desktop.  
i'm never disappointed.
the back yard is at the edge of a large field and there is usually quite a heavy breeze the comes across the field.
this frisbee is excellent in high winds.
never noticed any wobble at all.
it is too heavy for the small hands of young children of course.
my son is 11 and he handles it fine as well as my 13 year old daughter.
very high quality and wonderful frisbee!
this is the best type of money clip w/knife ever that i have had.
"never had one like this, have a money clip"
but that's all.
"this is awesome, i find myself doing little things around the house , on my truck or car etc."
"and most of the time i need a knife to cut or do something, so instead of going to the tool box i have it with me."
"this is a great product, highly recommend it to anyone no matter what she or he is doing.  "
thank you  daryl leverenz
this bottle is as close to perfect as i can imagine.
main reason i bought it is because it's not plastic and porous.
"it comes with multiple, durable lids and i have dropped it several times (on asphalt parking lot) only to have it barely get scratched."
i carry it everywhere and know as a rule of thumb to drink two bottles of water this size a day
so it's easy to keep track of on a hectic day.
be sure and buy a long bottle brush to keep it clean and sanitized!
promptly shipped and works well.
i use them outside where i change bulbs throughout the year depending on the season/holiday.
works great with the programmable led light strip i purchase from a different company
these are great for indoor practice.  
just hang a blanket inside a cardboard box and hang your target in front of it.
love this planner.
shopped in a variety of places for such as this.
"i had one for 2016, but the place where i bought it didn't carry this item this year."
"love dogs, love the design."
don't stop printing this particular design.
thank you.
what can i say........
it is a cover for a nickent 4dx fairway wood.
"it is marked the same as all my other nickent 4dx covers, it covers my club in my bag"
so i suppose it does what it is meant to.
through
golfio inc. price
"wise, good pricing, shippping was high from usa to aus"
but if you combine shipping by buying 2 or more items then the shipping becomes a lot more reasonable.
unfortunately this product does not make you hit the ball better................
the cover feels as though it has been made well and the stitching was tidy.
this item came with the small clip tag at the top for attaching the nickent number so you can use it for other clubs provided you have the number already.
( or it will just come with the number that you specify when ordering )
most likely i will be back to purchase from golfio in the future and the item has not fallen apart yet
so after only three rounds of golf
i can not really comment on the life of the product yet
but at least after a few uses it has not fallen apart.
i live in the far north of scotland and first used this lure on a day out in a sea loch known to hold sea trout (steelhead).
i fished on an outgoing tide in an area
i know
"well,but no luck."
"i put the crystal minnow on and,luck aside, i began to catch fish."
of the 3 hours remaining of the tide i landed 23 sea trout all between 2/3lbs (big for these waters)not counting those lost or short takers.
"i have fished with this lure in 3 colours since, same tide different places and enjoyed good catches."
all purchased from amazon.com as these lures cost a lot over here.
tight lines
this knife was a perfect fit for my camping gear.
"it is not to bulky, but big enough to handle many of the jobs that a folder would be to small to handle."
the curve of the blade helps make quick work of whatever you are cutting.
i did notice when i received the knife that a couple of the cutting edges were a little dull for my taste.
"a few minutes on the stone solved that, and the steel takes a good edge."
"overall i love this knife, so much i have purchased two more."
love this small size for travel and easy use.
"the scent is so good, better than many fragrances."
great photos of amy!  
(it seems only the most awful photos of her get large media
"circulation.)this portion is not part of my review, so please do not include it with my post.my sign-in email was hacked, they changed my password so i can no longer access my own email, causing me to abandon the account."
"if you want to contact me use "" gail98168 gmail.com "" which is my current email."
i took up golf when i turned 50.  
some would say too late.  
"after months of struggling with my drives, my slice, struggling to hit under 100, i decided to switch to this driver."
"since then, i've shot three rounds under 100, the last a 95.  "
it's not all due to this driver but the driver has helped me hit more fairways and hit the ball farther.
i love this club.
fished with this line for 25 years.
great line.
ordered smaller quantity to keep in tackle box when fishing with other in their boats and don't have access to my 1/4 lb spool.
when i first got this knife
"i thought i got what i payed for a $10 chinese blade, but then i took it into the woods to see what it could do i first had too get through a patch of briers"
so i started swingin the knife
and it sliced through them like butter
then i easily chopped down two maple trees about 2 inches thick.
then i easily sharpened the two chopped down trees into spears.
so that was enough of outdoor testing.
"the knifes teeth cut trough thick copper wire with ease, cardboard, 550 paracord."
"all thats left to test is the penetration power of the tanto point, so i lined up 2 halve inch pieces of plywood with a piece of 1/4 in hard plastic and stabbed it"
and the knife went clean through it.
so i would recommend this to a friend as a cheap quality survival/rough use/hunting/self defense knife

i wanted to wait to review these until i had a chance to test how sturdy they are.
the sound quality is great for earbuds; very bassy.
"the noise isolation works pretty well, but you need to understand that all that really means is that the earbuds themselves are shaped basically like large earplugs."
i therefore don't recommend them to people with small ears.
the cord is nice.
note:
it's not woven.
don't let
the pictures trick you into thinking
"the cord is woven.now, for the good part: i accidentally washed them."
they still work great.
"they came out of the dryer kind of coiled, but it was easily fixed with a hair dryer.  "
apple earbuds do the same thing.
note:
woven cords do not coil.so
they passed the washing machine test.
so i'm happy!
i am a music producer on the weekends.
just wanted to get some earbuds to use at the gym or just going around.
"being in the music industry i am exposed to big brand studio grade headphone names like audio technica, beyerdynamic, sony's professional line etc, i've never heard of betron before."
i just went with buying these because the review seem great and the price is really good.
these earbuds are absolutely amazing.
"while they are not the usual flat response studio kind of headphones i am used to (no where near flat response), they sound good."
"bass is not boomy and quite tight, mids are fine but the highs lack a little sparkle for my taste."
only used it with my phone.
"for the lot of you looking for earbuds here are mostly bass heads,  the lows are boosted a lot, but these do not overly exaggerate the bass that it loses all definition."
you can definitely still hear definition within the lower frequencies.
the build quility is good and i like the color accent on these things.
comes with a small nice pouch for storing and carrying case.
"will recommend to anyone, professional or not."
i was recently forced to go on a journey through inexpensive earbuds when my favorite brand stopped selling them here on amazon.
i ended up with four pairs of headphones.
because the first two i bought were defective.  
i'm listing them in order by best to worst for those shopping for earbuds:1.
cococat hr-007 is the best.  
"these headphones have the best sound, even better than my previous favorites the do-styles.  "
"the sound is very clean, the music gets very loud, and the bass has strong impact but doesn't overwhelm the sound quality.  "
"they also come with foam bud replacements, foam is way better than the rubber buds.  "
these are easily my new favorites.2.
betron ysm 1000 gets second.  
"they get much louder than the cococat hr-007's, but the sound quality isn't as nice.  "
it's easier to notice when using them right after the cococat.
"they do still have good sound quality, just not as good.  "
the sound has a piercing quality.
it almost hurts if you turn them up too loud.  
"i like really loud music, but it kind of gave me a headache.  "
"still, these would've been my favorite if not for the cococats"
and they will be my backup set for when the cococat eventually breaks.
(they also look really nice.  
"a downside is they only come with the rubber covers on the earbuds, there are no different sizes or backup pieces.).3."
granvela g10 gets third.  
"i got these when my dostyles went out, because they appear to be the same headphones.  "
"but, they broke within a few days."
"they were the cheapest at 12.99, so i guess you get what you pay for.  "
"before they broke, they did provide good sound, similar to the do-styles, but its sound quality and bass lags behind both the cococat and betrons.4."
ectreme wired metal comes in last.  
these were defective right out of the box.  
the sound in the left ear bud was only a fraction of the sounds in the right ear bud.  
which is a shame because the right ear bud sounded like it was thumping and had really good bass.
"the sound was clearer than the granvela out of it, but it still lagged behind the top 2 headphones."
"still, it comes in last for being defective in that manner, and others have brought it up, as well, so"
i think it's a regular product flaw.
"overall, i recommend the cococats."
"i ordered these and about a month later, the right earbud stopped working."
"no big deal, i emailed them and they promptly shipped me a replacement pair of headphones."
"it was a very fast delivery, but did not send any packing to return my device when they said it would either be attached in the email or sent with the package."
"my new pair of headphones worked well for maybe about two weeks, when the right earbud somehow stopped working."
"the audio quality was slowly diminishing in both, as well."
"i use these headphones maybe once every few days, and they are stored in the carrying pouch that betron provided in the packaging when not in use."
i am very disappointed.
"granted, these aren't very expensive, but i expected to be able to use them for more than two weeks."
you can't beat the betron for value.
these buds are extremely solidly built.
the cords are thick and do not tangle.
the fit in the ear is snug right out of the box.
best of all they scream metal better than products
3x the price.
i am extremely satisfied with these.
just got these today and they were a day early
and i'm very pleased with the look of the box and
how many ear pieces that it came with.
"i got a good pair and they have pretty good bass and good sound,better than my old pair."
if these turn bad for not reason i will edit this review but so far i am pleased with my purchase.
one month later they are still in very good condition and works like it was out of the boxtwo
"months later they still work, they have gotten dropped and smacked on stuff accidentally and are still in very good condition."
"edit a couple days later: one side has stopped working, i might want to get a warranty or somethingedit one year later: after about a year i have had to have them replaced a couple times."
reaching out to the company was easy and they shipped fast.
earbuds lasted about 6 months when taking good care of them.
i would avoid bending them and sticking them in small pockets to make them last the longest.
they work for xbox one controllers also.
"so far i’ved been able to use them on a toshiba laptop, xbox one controller, iphone 6, iphone 8 adapter, and my friends samsung/andriod phone."
overall pretty good earbuds and last a bit longer than average.
"my earphones broke within the first few days at the base, they boast about avip  guarantee for a year"
but when you contact them by email they do not respond and there is no phone number to call
"i love these headphones for work and listening to mostly v0 vbr tracks on my phone, or sometimes audio books."
"the first pair broke, so i gladly bought a another (and would again and again)."
"i rarely have iems last a few months, but these held up very well."
betron randomly emailed me offering a replacement pair after i had already re-purchased them.
the sound signature is mostly flat and not at all bassy like larger drivers.
nor is it cheap or tinny.
"they aren't audiophile quality iems, but they sound okay for general use."
the cord is very sturdy and doesn't make too much noise when rubbing against clothing.
they are comfortable to wear many hours.
"they are very sturdy, and accessories include a clip and carrying bag (which i just realized i haven't been using, but is very, very handy.)get them."
it's worth the few extra $'s in my experience.
"and if they break within a year, apparently betron will replace them."
i'm giving the replacement pair to a friend along with a high recommendation.  
easy 5/5 rating.
these earbuds are huge.
i feel like i’m sticking giant metal corn cobs in my ears.
i’d forgive the size if they sounded great but the sound is terrible.
i’d say the sound quality is below the earbuds included with most phones and tablets.
there are no lows and no highs coming through.
i feel like i’m listening to the stock am/fm radio in a 1982 oldsmobile and that may be giving these earbuds too much credit.
i’ve owned many earbuds and these are easily the worst of the bunch.
"if they were $1, i’d still skip these."
i can't figure out all the positive review with these headphones.  
i go through cheap headphones frequently and thought i would give these a try this time.  
but they don't even compare favorably to the other cheap alternatives i usually find on amazon.  
"my complaint is that the sound output feels completely lacking in bass, and it's a high tin and treble sound.  "
music just doesn't sound very full.  
not my thing :-(

"still, it comes in last for being defective in that manner, and others have brought it up, as well, so"
i think it's a regular product flaw.
"overall, i recommend the cococats."
"first, let me say the build quality of these ear buds are top notch, and they sound great."
they provide a good seal around the ear and have decent enough bass.
but these things are very uncomfortable.
it feels like there's a piece of metal or something that pokes my ear while i'm wearing them.
"so, needless to say i don't use them much."
i use these headphones at work.
"at first they worked out fine, but after a few months the left headphone started shocking me."
"at first i wasn't sure what it was, but then i realized it was the headphones."
"i kept using it thinking maybe it was a fluke, but then it kept doing it"
so finally i had to just throw them away.
i hear this popping sound and then sometimes it will lead to a shock.
"i'm not sure if i just got a defective unit, but i would not buy these again."
"i did not spillanything on them, i did not drop them, and i always put them away after i was done using them..."
it was too late for me to return them after the first shock happened..
the company contacted me for feedback on the earbuds.  
i explained the sound was ok
but the fit was poor.  
3 sets of large ear bud cushions and only 1 set of small were included.  
they responded that they would not give me new ear bud cushions (i didn't ask).  
"when i said i would provide their response in my feedback, i discovered the company was no longer accepting feedback on this product.  "
i had never seen that before
but it looked suspicious.  
i reported to amazon and kept trying to add feedback until today it finally accepted it today.
"these earbuds aren't terrible, but i wouldn't recommend buying them."
the build quality seems pretty good.
i've been using them for a little while now
and they seem sturdy.
"they fit well into my ears and are comfortable to wear, although a little heavy compared to other earbuds i own, but i assume that's because these are made with metal and not plastic."
where these fall short is the sound quality.
"i tested these across a wide range of music types and listening devices, and they just lack tonal depth."
"they are loud compared to other earbuds, which isn't a big issue since you can simply turn the volume down, but at higher volumes they hurt my ears and if you're not careful, i feel like they could risk damaging your hearing when compared to other earbuds."
"they also sound flat, which is disappointing."
"they have bass, and it is deep and booming, but it lacks range and depth."
it's kind of like listening to bass through a wall.
"you miss the richness, and the bass just kind of sounds one-dimensional."
"the mid range is nearly absent, and the treble is piercing."
"it's not extreme, but after about 20 minutes of listening to music on these, i get a headache consistently."
"when comparing these to other earbuds in the same price range, these fall somewhere in the middle."
"they have a little more oomph than the worst earbuds, but they lack the richness and clarity of better quality earbuds i own."
"some of the best earbuds i owned were the skull candy xl, but they don't seem to make those anymore, so i'm on a quest to find a quality pair of earbuds below $30."
"the panasonic ones i bought sounded awesome (much, much better than these) but broke in less than a month."
"the betron ysm1000 headphones are a sturdier build quality than the panasonic, but the audio quality leaves a lot to be desired and gives me a headache after prolonged use."
"you can find better sounding headphones in this price range, so i don't recommend buying these."
"i was excited when my shipment arrived, but as soon as i saw the ear buds i knew something was wrong."
"instead of the packaging pictured in this listing marked betron, i received a generic white package that just read, ""deep bass."
"""when"
i examined the contents the ear buds looked as pictured
but i did not get the pouch as was pictured in this listing.
just the ear buds in the generic white box.
i crossed my fingers and hoped they sounded as advertised
but that didn't happen.
the left ear bud kept cutting in and out which was very disappointing.
when it was working it sounded pretty good but if you moved it would cut off
and you had to play with it to get it working again.
i'm totally disappointed.
"i expected better based on all the positive reviews, but instead it looks like i got somebody's repackaged return that doesn't work properly and was missing parts."
"at this price point (and even up to the $50 range), any cons are greatly outweighed by the pros the ysm1000s offer."
"while they are touted as deep bass, the lower ranges offer a nice sound with some muddiness depending on the source and volume."
do not expect a full on amp-driven headset experience -- it's not fair to the product or the price.
"the sound they offer, the quality and durability of the build, comfort for long sessions, and the price make it a great purchase."
i've used them heavily for over a year with no signs of slowing down or coming apart.
"the cord hasn't had any of the tangling issues many others in this sub-$50 range have exhibited, and they've been a purchase i would not only recommend but would make again."
great as a primary unit or stellar backup.
"all relative based on budget and expectations, to be clear."
the profile and miniscule encumbrance of earbuds in general make them an appealing choice for many applications and uses.
great value is the bottom line here.
"they make no pretense to be an audiophile's or engineer's go-to pick, and reviewing them as such would be disingenuous."
"they're not a low-budget silver audio bullet for all situations, but they offer a great bang for your buck."
"first of all, these headphones sound fantastic; especially for the price.  "
"they have a good range and solid bass, which is exactly what i was looking for.  "
my one major complaint is that i cannot seem to keep them in my ear when i am working out
and i am constantly shoving them in back my ear.  
i've tried using the supplied clip and i have also tried using every size of ear cushion that came with the earbuds to no avail.  
"i think the earbuds are a little too heavy and oblong, with most of the weight located in the back of the ear-piece,"
so they naturally fall out of my ear.
if you are just looking for a set of earbuds to use while sitting at your desk or on a plane
"then i highly recommend these, but if you plan to work out or move around, you might want to find something a little lighter or of a different shape."
decent.
worth the cost.
it's nice
they include a pair of memory foam earbuds.
to me that is a huge bonus because the other sizes they include are your typical flimsy plastic or
what ever material they are.
"i can never seem to find a pair to fit my ear properly besides the memory foam ones, so that is greatly appreciated."
i bought these to listen to asmr and music occasionally when i'm about to go to sleep.
"i can sleep on my side with these, but i think that's because of my pillow."
i have a very soft pillow
so my head kinda sinks right in.
i cant say the same if you have a stiff pillow.
"or maybe you have a shallow ear canal, who knows."
"all i can say is, they work wonderful for what i needed them for."
as for sound quality ....
its .... alright.
"these are not exactly expensive earbuds, you get what you pay for."
"but they are nice and heavy, and feel of good build quality."
the bass is also nice and thumpy as well.
all n
all a decent pair of earbuds for the price.
only reason i didnt give this
a 5 star is because of the cord.
the cord itself strikes me as very cheap and over time will become brittle.
i've owned these for a few months now and no issues.
but i am also a light user.
i cant say the same for someone else who might use these for exercise or are a bit tougher on them.
the cord just feels of cheap material.
everything else feels nice and solid though.
"once again, great product for the price."
i would definitely buy again if these broke or were lost or stolen
"as an initial matter, these are a great value.  "
"well made (largely metal), the earbuds have incredible bass and are able to generate far more volume from my little mp3 player than any other headphones i've tried over the years.  "
(the latter is important when listening on a rumbling bart
train.)the downside is the acoustic profile.  
the bass is overwhelming.  
"i found that by tweaking with my device's equalizer, however, i could get very good but"
not great sound.  
i had to quickly replace a pair of more expensive sennheiser's (almost twice as expensive) and the betron's have superior volume and bass but cannot match the sennheisers at the higher frequencies.  
the betrons also seem to fit more comfortably than the sennheisers.
"bottom line, if you are into high-end audio, its worth spending another $20 or more to move up a notch in quality at the higher ranges.  "
"however, for fans of bass-heavy music, these are probably as good or better than most sets in the $20-30 range.  "
"for those who listen mostly to podcasts and audio books, there is no need to go above these.  "
"also, for the budget conscious, if you play with your equalizer, these are certainly superior to most other sets at the price point."
"i'll probably will move up to a higher-end set eventually, but i will definitely keep these around.  "
they serve a lot of purposes quite well at a minimal price.
"based on the reviews (even though people rave about these), they are just $20 earphones."
i initially bought them because my other headphones were becoming uncomfortable over an extended period of time and thought these would be good replacements.
i was sorely mistaken.  
here are my pros/cons:pros: -
cheap - comes with a little faux leather pouch you can store your headphones and extra earbuds.
- looks good.
cons: -
the wiring is a lot thinner than i anticipated.
-
build quality is just below average -
the sound is not really that good.
these would be good as a back up pair in case of emergencies.
"these are ok, with a few issues:1)"
"the rubber ear pieces are all a bit large, causing ear pain after an hour or so.2)"
"they have a grounding issue, where they ""crackle"" with static when you move, like cloth on cloth in a chair, etc.3)"
"the cable picks the slightest movement, sending loud bumps into ear buds."
"bass response is better than some other models, but comfort is not great."
"the earbuds came in a nice box with a bunch of earbud covers, which i initially thought meant they were really good."
"however, i quickly found out that the company was overcompensating for a poor product."
"immediately, the earbuds began to crackle and stop working abruptly."
my phone would act as if they were unplugged when they were plugged in.
the most annoying part is the crackling part though.
they also fit really awkwardly in your ears.
i’m really disappointed.
not great.
"audio itself is good, but they're uncomfortable after a while and don't stay in your ear as well as most others."
"worst of all, any friction against any part of the cord comes through the headphones as static."
it sounds like a stethoscope.
so essentially any movement while using these gets in the way of the audio.
i'd recommend investing in a better pair.
"update: after only 4 months, one speaker doesn't work.  "
"they have stayed on my desk at work, been used only 1-2 times a week, and have never been abused.  "
there is no reason for one side to quit.
they're
okay.
they look very nice and the sound quality is average.
"my dislike is their shape - even with smaller rubber bits, they are bulky in my ears."
i doubt you will find another brand on the 50 dollars or less market that perform this well.
i have owned a ton of headphones over the years and buy another set every so often.
"these beat my expectation, they are real metal on the outside!"
i expected a light plastic to look like metal.
the wires are twisted tight and hold up
well ive knocked them out several times due to my own issues and they never gave out.
the buds they come with fit solid in the ear and the weight of the metal helps them stay in comfortably.
"best part is the price, i expected much less and got much more."
do they compare to the high end?
i would say so!
they have a great clear tone and they function through a range of tones without any popping or other distortion.
"they are clear, i mean clear as in high treble and good mid tones."
"bass is replicated and a good mid sound, not deep bass"
but it performs well.
i would suggest these to anyone looking for headphones that does not need blue tooth a ton of bells and whistles and wants a durable piece.
the earbuds have good sound quality and there seems like there is a little more bass but not sure if its that much better than my other earbuds that are half the price.
a couple other things prevent it from giving it 5 stars.
the first is they are too big and bulky for my ears and easily fall out in almost every situation.
"second, is there is metal parts that i assume to make certain areas more durable but may be the cause of increased amount of static electrical buzz in the earbuds for certain clothing."
"but hey, what does it matter what i write, reviews don't matter."
you'll probably buy it anyways even if you read this.
a computer program/ai can pump out reviews quicker.
"beautiful headphones, with great sound quality."
"i just can’t get them to stay in my ears if i’m walking or running— which is a pretty big deal for me, considering that’s when i use headphones."
beautiful packaging too.
"unfortunately i’ll have to keep these as my backup pair, and go back to *"
gasp
* apple’s headphones for my main pair.
i can only afford budget earbuds
so this review is in comparison with other budget sets i've bought.  
these betrons are far and away the best sounding earbuds i've ever bought.  
"the bass is really good, not boomy, to my ears.  "
"treble is adequate to good, smooth at times but somewhat shrill at others.  "
but i think that depends on the type and quality of the music itself.  
i can hear details in my music that i don't hear in other budget sets.  
overall frequency response is very good to my ears.  
noise cancellation will depend on how well these buds fit in your ear canal; i didn't buy them for that feature.  
these earbuds appear to be well-made.  
betron is a very good company to do business with.  
"in my experience, they were quick to respond to me and stood behind their products (warranty issue).  "
i liked my first purchase of betrons so much that i bought another pair.
i love these headphones!
they fit in my ears perfectly and don't fall out.
the sound quality is crystal clear.
"i have trouble with other earbuds falling out of my ears, but the beltron earbuds stay in."
i am very happy with my purchase.
for the price these can’t be beat!
i’m a welder
so i used these everyday monday-friday for 8 hrs.
so i have put these things thru hell!
& i’m amazed at how well these are built.
since i work in a weld shop
"i’m surrounded by air compressor noise, grinders, air tools, fans, exhaust fans, etc."
& these do a awesome job at eliminating outside noise!
i’m on my 3rd pair now.
"the first pair i had for over a year, & at my fault i pulled the aux by the cord at the end of my shift to take them out, causing one of the cords to break resulting in one ear bud not working anymore."
luckily i bought the warranty with it
so it was replaced.
"the 2nd pair i got the aux was shorting out shorting after receiving it, contacted seller &"
i got another set in the mail....
in 2 days!
talk about awesome customer support!!
"if your looking for a durable, yet great sounding, heavy bass earbuds, look no further."
the sounds can’t be beat.
since i use these for 8 hrs a day i listen to all kinds of music.
"rap, hip-hop, country, podcasts, etc."
& every genre sounds as good as the last.
"i will continue to buy these because i honestly don’t want to spend my hard earned money on a different brand & be disappointing, plus"
cause i know these are a winner.
"buy these, you won’t be disappointed!!!"
5 star product & 5 star customer support!!
👍🏻
exceptional quality so far.
hasn't shown a hint of not working properly after all this time of using them and i tend to be rough with my ear speakers.
the only reason i give it 4 stars out of 5 is that there is no way to turn down the hearing power.
i would love to get some ear speakers that could actually filter out some high pitched sounds the same way the human ears filter out high pitched sounds that dogs can hear.
there's a lot of terrible stuff we can hear on the internet and in video games and such that i simply would prefer not to hear (think of irritating music or obnoxious alarms as examples)... being able to activate a 'dull sounds' mode would be fantastic.
"not sure if technology is there yet, but if it is, then i guess it's not available at this price tag."
"but if you just want standard ear speakers that aren't irresponsibly made, these should be fine!"
i bought these as an early christmas gift for my husband
and we were both really pleased.
"firstly, they look really cool."
they are unique and i love the metal look.
the design makes these the perfect gift.  
they are substantial and well made.
they also fit very comfortably in the ear.
"as far as the sound goes, these earbuds deliver."
i’ve never had a pair of earbuds that cancel
noise this well.
"not only do they cancel noise, but the sound is clear and amplified."
i’m extremely impressed
and i plan on buying another pair for myself!
i’m starting over with a review i wrote about a week ago titled ‘betron wins 4 way comparison’.  
"i know i should just add updates to the original review, but enough has changed it doesn’t really work to do that."
i needed to replace a couple pairs of inexpensive earphones.  
"earphones vary widely in sound even if well reviewed, so i ended up ordering four sets, and later a fifth set, the kzs, to try:  "
kz zst about $19  betron
i ysm1000 about $19  
"symphonized nrg 3.0 about $25  panasonic rp-hje120 about $10, already owned, for comparisonblitwolf graphene"
"about $24cococat hr-007 about $20music source was a pc with upgraded audio caps, realtek alc1150 codec, and equalizer apo software, all set to flat unless noted.  "
music was .mp3s
encoded from cd’s using maximum quality settings
(like v0 q0).the kz zxts were the best
if you have some sort of eq available.  
"that may seem like cheating but single balanced armature designs often need eq to sound their best, the reward is a clarity i have not heard in dynamic driver designs.  "
most people can get free equalizer software for their phones or pcs – i’ll see if i can post a screenshot of eq settings but
"the basics are a shallow midrange boost from 300 to 1.2khz,"
"a 5 db cut at 4k and 5k, a slight boost around 100hz and a cut around 40hz.  "
"ear fitment with these is the downside as in ‘fall out’, solvable at my desk but not exercise so far.  "
i think they need a mm or 2 longer spigots to allow tips to go farther into ear canal.
the betrons and the symphonizeds ended up tied.  
"both are good choices with a little too much bass but many people will like that, especially if your music source doesn’t have much bass oomph.  "
"when i first posted my review, the betrons sounded better than the symphonizeds, but after a week of use, suddenly something happened to the extra clarity and naturalness of the betrons"
– i was using them on several different pieces of equipment
so maybe i damaged them in some way.  
they ended up sounding very much like the symphonizeds.
i found that lightly sealing the back vents of the symphonizeds with the tips of my fingers tightened up and leveled off the bass – better to my tastes.  
"if you like this you could try sealing them permanently but be cautious as solvent vapor from adhesives, including the acetic acid from regular silicone, will get trapped inside and may damage ‘phones.  "
obviously this will void your warranty – proceed at your own risk.
"the panasonic rp-hje120 has taut bass, good mids, and slightly rolled off highs but is very musical – if you are on a budget and/or replace ‘phones a lot"
they are a great choice.  
"on this list they would place behind the betrons and the symphonizeds, which offer better dynamics and a better “hear through” to portions of the live performance, with the panasonics offering a more natural frequency profile."
i ended up returning the bitwolfs and the cococats.  
the bitwolfs suffered from too much bass.  
"i tried a 5db octave bass rolloff starting at 160hz which helped, but even then the overall sound was not as good as the betrons or symphonizeds.  "
the cococats had too much high mids and treble.  
in addition there was a slight ‘smearing’ of treble sounds making them not as clear or natural as any other headphones mentioned here.  
i think they would be better off using one larger speaker driver instead of two smaller ones.

"i found these earbuds when i was searching for koss earbuds, which are cheap and great quality."
the betron ysm1000 earbuds also showed up in my search and i read the reviews on amazon and online
and they came with a high rating 4.5 stars and above.
so i decided why not try these out
and i am glad i did.
the material is solid quality from the connector  to the earbuds.
"many times the connector to your phone or computer gets worn out over time from plugging in and out, but these have a solid built that i am confident will last a long time."
"ok now on to the most important part, the sound."
"when i first used them the bass was a bit high, but after adjusting them on my phone, which is a oneplus 5, they sound is as good as any of the earbuds"
$50 or higher.
"it never waivers from listening to music, watching a movie or a podcast."
"another nice thing is they come with a nice pouch to store them in and extra ear pieces, not the flimsy ones the other companies give you, but foam and plastic ones of different sizes."
i like the foam ones because they fit well and buffer out the outside noises.
"of course i only have had them for a few weeks and my star rating could change, but as of right now i give them 5 stars."
"these buds are really nice to look at, perceived value is quite high."
"after you choose the correct pad for your ears the sound is good, bass is good and the ""noise isolating"" does appear to work."
what i found out was that if you are active (such as washing you car)
the buds tend to move slightly and when the buds move
"the sound is reduced to a tinny am transistor radio sound, the bass and noise isolating goes away too."
"these buds seem to have a very tiny range, in your ear, in which all the features work well, move out of that tiny range (the bud moves for whatever reason) and the sound degrades dramatically."
summing: if you are quite and don't move a lot
these buds are very nice
", if you move around then i hope you experience will be better than mine."
"i am very, very picky with my earbuds."
"a lack of clarity just bother me, i can't not hear it."
"i'm not a sound expert, so i can't tell you specifically what's wrong with a pair of earbuds when i listen, but i can certainly perceive the flaws."
"further, i am pretty rough on my earbuds; not to the extreme"
but i don't exactly go out of my way to shield them in my daily life.
my earbuds will inevitably be pushed and tugged and wound tight and tangled and put under all kinds of strains.
i've even accidentally dunked mine in water an unfortunate amount of times.
i purchased two of these.
"one of them had a slight audio defect in the left ear that made it sound slightly muddy, so i set them aside for backup until someone else"
i know wanted them (they couldn't hear the issue.
"like i said, i'm picky)."
the other pair was fine.
"they, admittedly, did die eventually."
"but they survived all of the abuse i put them through for almost a year before doing so, which is longer than basically any other pair of earbuds"
i've ever had - and that includes a set of boses i got as a christmas present.
"in fact, that's what this pair replaced."
"i purchased my two in august last year under one of amazon's lighting deals and not only did they come packaged impressively, but the ones i kept met my very particular standards of audio quality and maintained that quality until their unfortunate demise."
what killed them?
probably just wear and tear; one of the earbuds just stopped working one day.
this is to say that the product perhaps needs further quality control - or at least did when mine were made - since one set of earbuds came out minorly flawed and the other more durable than any other i've purchased at this pricepoint.
"that's why i give this four stars instead of five, even though i really loved the pair i kept."
would i recommend them?
sure.
there's hundreds of different earbud brands at this point and you can probably find similar quality for cheaper if you're willing to play buyer's roulette with amazon.
"currently i'm using another pair of gift earbuds, but when those inevitably die, i'll come check these out again."
these headphones are okay.
"i tried out so many different ear squishies to get the right fit, and never really found one, so my right ear was constantly falling out."
"the sound quality was good, and blocked out noise outside a little bit, pretty well for little cheap things."
"the problem is that yesterday, they started zapping my ear!!"
"it's been about 3 months since i started using them; i take care of them by putting them into the little baggie all the time, and not scrunching the wires, and loosely coiling them so they don't get tangled, but wow, the noise would crackle for a second, and then quickly zap my ear, and it hurts, but was bearable,"
"so i kept wearing them throughout the day, but they just kept increasing in frequency, so i stopped listening to music at that point."
pretty disappointed and sad.
i will meet it half way with a three stars.
pros:
*
price is just too hard to beat.
*
it has a distinct look to it.
cons:
*
it sounds as much as it cost.
if you watched a youtuber saying this sound good then you should definitely never again watch anything from such.
it just sounds like utter trash compared to any headphones i have ever owned.
now if sounds is not your thing.. and you could care less
then sure this are for you.
*
fragile.
the foam tips don't stay well on the piece as mentioned by other reviewers.
to be sincere they had reviews for this piece blocked for a long time.
i feel like the ratio of good and bad reviews would be much different if that wasn't the case.
i don't know..
just feels fishy.
"i've been looking for good, affordable headphones for a while"
and i decided to purchase these.
i purchased one and then bought another a short while later because i liked the quality of the sound.
"however, one pair is already showing signs of a defect."
one earbud's sound is way quieter than the other ear bud after only a few months of light use.
"sad, because i liked these while they lasted."
:(edit:
it seems like both of my headphones keep doing the same thing where one ear bud's sound quality would go down.
"however, when i use them a few days later the quality comes back."
very weird.
but i raised my review from 2 stars to 3 stars.
for the price these are fantastic.
clear bass kicks.
no distortion that i could notice even at high volume.
well built.
the steel feel and design is awesome.
i’ve had them for a month now
and they’ve become my everyday set over my bluetooth set.
fantastic product for the price.
edit:bought these in march.
it is june 17 and the left earbud stopped working.
real shame that they didn’t last me a full 3 months.
i will downgrade them accordingly.
i really wanted to like these earbuds.
but the durability does not seem to be there.
the sound quality is pretty good (considering the price).
"combined with the fact that you can't hear much of your surroundings when playing music, these earbuds make for a clear and immersive experience for studying or activities."
"the bass is good, but it doesn't stand out much from other earbuds i've owned."
i bought these last fall and probably would have given them 4 stars if not for an electrocution problem that started probably 1 month ago.
it wasn't too painful and the air was really dry at the time
and so i just figured that it was the static electricity and not the earbuds themselves.
"after the dry air subsided, they went back to normal function."
"but this week, without any warning and without anything extraneous that could possibly explain it, both earbuds (which were in my ears) electrocuted me."
"when i say electrocuted, i mean it more in the sense that it felt like someone took a needle and poked it at my eardrums simultaneously rather than sticking a metal fork into an outlet."
"it was painful, unexpected, and i will not be using them again after this."
i'd prefer to retain my ability to hear things.
"so, that said, solid earbuds for the price, but there may be a chance that they'll electrocute you."
"first, they're built like brass cufflinks."
rock solid and aren't going to pop apart when you set something down on them like the ubiquitous <$10 plastic buds.  
"if you care about aesthetics, they look like jewelry."
sound:  
"i would characterize these as full, balanced and crisp."
the bass is good
"( bach organ works sounds great) if not huge, without sacrificing definition in the mids and highs."
"if you only care about bass, then get the bs10 , but for jazz and classical and"
"all things acoustic,  these are superb.  "
"for $15us and free prime shipping, they're also an unbeatable value."
these headphones it is easy to tell are high quality and packaged very beautifully like apple does.
i am very happy with the purchase.
the wire leading to each earbud is even see through and braided.
(very classsy).
they is a quality bass response.
i can finally throw away my cheap chinese made
ear bud headphones whose bad quality has been very frustrating to use.
(they were 8.00 approximately.
these headphones are worth the extra money).
i only wish i did not throw away the beautiffully crafted box they come in.
it would have been good to store the extra bud sizes and wire that these quality headphones come with.
my mistake!
"first things first, the aesthetics and presentation blew me away right out of the mailbox."
"i know ""don't judge a book by its cover"", but"
"the nice little box, the headphones tucked nicely into their little channels, the plastic sheath over the plug, the magnetic carrying case..."
very nice stuff.
"the headphones themselves feel and look quite nice, the cable is a good flexible, smooth rubber, feels almost like silicone."
the sound seems solid so far.
"the bass is present but not overpowering, still solid and not muddy."
"the mids could maybe be dialed back, but they seem to sit in the right spot for heavy metal guitars where you get the crunch and body, but it doesn't make the guitars sound like they're made of cardboard if that makes sense."
"the mids aren't ""honky""."
the highs are clear enough but not piercing.
i'm sure 5 minutes with some eq adjustments and these things will sound like a million bucks.
will update with any issues
great buds
but....no different in sound quality to some of the skullcandy buds from fivebelow.
"if there is, it's very minimal."
"and for me, the comfort was the difference."
"the bud rubbers were a bit too fat for my ears, so i gave em to my girl."
"she gave me her skullcandy's, and they fit just right, plus sound quality was not compromised."
things that make me go hmmm...
"if i can get skullcandy buds with equal sound quality, why am i buying these if i can buy 2-3 of those?"
i'm always skeptical of headphones as they always seem to fall apart no matter how expensive they might be.
i find these fit into my ear well even though they look a bit too long compared to most options out there.
they seem to stay in more than others have and experienced no discomfort wearing for long periods.
"the sound is pretty full for all genres, cord stays pretty tangle free for the most part."
"after some good use they haven't showed any sign of breaking at the earbud connection that is common, though the aux plug is bent a little after some gym use."
for as inexpensive as they are
i'm pretty happy with the purchase.
"after studying the earbuds, and checking the website i had to write to the company to ask which earbud was for which ear.  "
i got a reply back almost instantly.  
the reply was:  the l and r symbols are engraved under the gold coating right under the earbud.  
"i had to use the magnifier and flashlight on my phone to find it, and even that wasn't the easiest.  "
"it should just say on the box or, at least, on the website.  "
"black is for the left ear, red is for the right ear."
"so far, very nice earbuds.  "
"a little bigger than most, which only really matters as i sleep with one in, but not much of an issue.  "
the sound is very nice and they have a very pleasant look.  
they come with a soft case and different sized covers to fit your ear.  
"for the price, i am very happy with this purchase."
very quick delivery even though these were back-ordered.
"i didn't realize it when i ordered them, so i wrote them a message"
and indeed they shipped me
the earbuds earlier than they thought they could.
so that was a plus.
"also, i instantly tried out the sound quality compared to my old earbuds"
"and yes, they do carry bass better."
"since i have a hearing loss, this was another plus."
"finally, the only thing that makes me nervous is that the plug part is straight and not at a 90 degree angle - in the past these tend to crunch"
"and then i lose sound in one of the two earbuds - however, that isn't the case so far and it's my own fault for not having noticed the style i bought for the plug."
"i am satisfied with the quality of these upon receiving, and very happy to have them before thursday."
the weighted brass on the ear buds gives a nice feeling of a sturdy build which i hope lasts.
the default cushions that came on the earbuds fit perfectly in my ears and does a very good job at canceling outside noise.
when using these on my computer i had to adjust some of the audio levels to avoid a weird muffled sound
but it was very minimal work on my end.
the deep bass that this product advertise is indeed deep and gets better if you're able to adjust the audio levels to get a consistent sound.
"overall, i'm very please with this product."
the headphones and even the aux jack are made with really durable quality materials.
however the cable itself is unfortunately very delicate.
"with mine, the issue was that when i connected the headphones to my phone and put the phone in my pocket  the cable would fold and rub over the sharp edged base of the aux jack."
over a really short period of time (a month and a half)
the headphones just stopped working.
i wouldn't recommend purchasing this.
"i preemptively put sugru moldable glue and electrical tape, because i could really tell this was going to be an issue upon first seeming it."
it only shortly delayed the inevitable.
"it's a shame, because these headphones were pretty good, but having such a debilitatingly fragile cable just cancels out all of it."
earphones worked great for a bit.
"sound quality wasn't bad at all, and regardless of it not having a mic, they worked."
"unfortunately, not even a month later, the left earbud gradually got lower and lower (which aren't labeled, but red"
=right and blue
=left)
compared to the right.
"i've tried setting the audio settings on my phone to make the left one sound louder to try and counteract it, but it was too low to even work with."
"luckily, i'm able to return these in time."
i wouldn't recommend them due to the fact that i can go to wal-mart and buy $20 ones that last much longer (not a good thing).
"good earbuds for the price, but after 6 months of use, i continue to be aggravated by the fit.  "
"the earbuds are very round, and often fall out of my ears.  "
"i wear them often while moving around, chores, commuting, etc."
and am continually having to push them in.  
"besides this, the sound is good, and the cording is great.  "
other earbuds in this price range fail due to bad wiring within a few weeks to months.  
these are well made.  
"if you won't be moving around too much, i.e. at a desk, or relatively still while listening, you'll be happy."
"seem to be very well made, and are visually appealing, but as far as the sound, i have better in the same price range."
"bass is as advertised and treble is good, but it all falls apart in the mid range."
very muddy and almost muffled sounding.
"used a headphone amp and it cleaned up a bit, but still noticeable lack in the mids."
have
many iem's
"so i am not a novice, and it's great"
"that there as so many positive reviews, but these are just not for me."
the sound quality on these earbuds are excellent.
listening to music on these compared to my old earbuds was an awesome experience.
"however, there is one major flaw-"
these do not stay in ththe ears very well at all.
"i can't use these earbuds when exercising because they fall out with any motion, which is too bad."
the headphones have an upscale look and feel good in the ear.
"nice bass and mids, treble is poor / muffled."
"if you're interested in the look or fashion, a good buy."
not so much if you want good sound.
i'll start off by saying that even with all the different tip options these ear buds are big and didn't fit in mine or my daughter's ears.
"even after managing to get them usable, they do not stay in even sitting"
still let alone moving around.
"for the price, the sound is good, but only when they are properly seated in the ears."
"if that can't happen, sound quality becomes pointless."
"after all the fuss trying them out, i didn't feel right returning them."
hopefully i can find someone who likes them.
i wasn't impressed.  
"i bought these, because of the reviews..."
"for the life of me, i don't know how they got such positive reviews.  "
"the sound wasn't great, there is no heavy deep bass, and they fit weird in my ears.  "
"for $10, they may be totally awesome..."
"but, i'd rather spend more money and get true quality sound.  "
ended up keeping these in case
"i don't have my good ones on me, but i literally never use them.  "
ended up buying some bose earbuds compatible with android phones.  
those... are awesome.
bought these after a pair of
sennheiser ear buds started failing on me.  
"construction quality of these earbuds seems quite good, but the sound quality isn't as good as my old sennheisers..."
they're a little muddier and less clear.  
for the price though they're a very good value and worth trying.
july 10 2019 update...managed to trash these headphones...
the cord got snagged as i walked by something and the cord separated from the headphone plug.  
despite the apparently weak wires i'm buying another set of these...
they get the job done.
i exclusively use sennheiser headphones for everything
but i wanted to get a new pair of earbuds for specific reasons.
i am extremely surprised at the quality of these for the price.
these are terrific earbuds.
comes with a convenient pouch for the accessories that also double for storing them while not in use.
would absolutely purchase again.
"i won't be the first to note it, but the bass on these things is insane."
"if you're a purist who wants the truest sound reproduction possible, these earbuds are not for you."
"if you like your music to have some extra kick, though, and you don't want to spend a lot of money, you should most definitely buy these."
"another plus: they fit my ear canals snugly right out of the box, which almost never happens with earbuds."
well worth the price.  
elaborate packaging made it feel like they couldve toned it down and charged a couple bucks less.
"i also dont like the solid metal jack as i listen with my phone in my jeans front pocket and it already bent, which makes me worry about it actually breaking my phone since it cannot give."
they arent kidding about the deep bass.  
its
"a little muddy and kinda  too much mid-bass, but that works well enough for most kinds of music.  "
i tried every iphone equalizer setting and couldnt get the sound right.  
then i remembered they were ten bucks.
love the deep bass these headphones provide!
i have seen other reviews that say these headphones don't have bass and are flat.
well these people must not have their equipment properly tuned or are using crap equipment.
"they sound great on my xbox one s, both my samsung galaxy tab s, and my tab s3."
they also sound really good connected to my phone.
the bass is pounding and sound awesome!
"they come with a case, extra earbuds and a clip."
even the box is high quality.
all for 15.99 on amazon!
i am definitely going to tell all my friends and family about these!
these earbuds appear to be well made with high quality materials.
the sound is brighter and with better volume than with the cheaper earbuds i had been using.
the base is there too but not as much as you would expect from true headphones.
i would not want to deafen myself by cranking up the sound any greater than i have too.
i would say these are well balanced.
"at 3x the cost of what i had been using, i think the added expense is worth it."
only time will tell how durable they are.
my ears are happy; what else matters !
the end of the headphones (gold part) got stuck inside my phone's jack when i pulled out my headphones from my phone after getting home from work.
i had to go to a cell phone repair store & pay $50 to get that part extracted from my phone.
"also, prior to this, i had to intermittently twist it inside the jack to get sound."
one other reviewer mentioned the same thing so i will not be repurchasing this
(i thought maybe it was a fluke
but it was my 2nd
pair!-the 1st pair was ok).
it may stem from usually listening to music while having the phone in my back pants pocket and the cable folding over.
off to find a new brand!
"the sound quality of these headphone are solid, but it’s hard to appreciate when the buds won’t stay in my ears (for any of the various bud sizes provided)."
"also, after a couple of months, they started making static popping noises as i walked around with them connected to my phone."
"at first i thought it was the iphone headphone adapter, but after buying a new one of those and testing with another set of headphones, i figured out it was these guys at fault."
"also, i’m fairly certain they’ve shocked me a few times (feels like a static shock) despite never dropping/harming them in any conceivable way, and i just now read another user’s review that says they’ve experienced this as well."
look elsewhere for another pair of earbuds.
i have different headphones i use for different things and
these i use for movies and by far the sound quality is amazing the bass is awesome
my ear vibrates and the sound is crisp
", there light weight don’t let that make you think there cheap they are simply now one of my favorite sets of audio headphones i have, and definitely recommend getting these if you want to feel all aspects of sound that your listening,"
im definitely
a audio freak
so i have tons of ear phones these are better then beats and enjoy beats alot but these are better
terrible.
they fall out of my ears after about 1 minute.
tried all the different plugs that case with it.
the cheapos that came with my cell phone work better.
find another product.
sound was nothing to write home about either.
these are a pretty average pair of ear buds.
i'm not sure why everyone thinks the sound quality is so great.
"don't get me wrong, they sound fine, but they're nothing to get too excited about."
"the long cord twists, gets caught on things, and then pulls out a lot."
the cord material attracts a lot of static which can shock your ears.
they also don't stay in your ears very well.
but they do look nice.
and they haven't shorted out yet after about a month.
"so overall, they're ok but not great."
update:
one of the ear buds shorted out.
they lasted about a month and and a half.
"i guess they come with a warranty,  so you can get a new pair of mediocre ear buds if you want."
i probably won't.
got these for my son for christmas.  
"he wasn't real excited about the gold color, but he loves the quality of the sound.  "
"when he's got these earbuds in, he can't hear anything but his music.  "
he's already recommended them to all of his friends.  
he says it's weird to see his classmates talking and not be able to hear anything they're saying (when he's wearing the ear buds).  
"not sure how durable they are, since we've only had them for a month, but he loves them!"

"i bought two pair, one for hubby without the mic."
one pair for myself with the mic.
both of us decided to watch a movie on our computer's using the headphones.
the first thing i noticed was how high the volume was on my old headphones.
because the sound is very clear on the betron headphones there is no need to have the volume set so high.
i really enjoyed hearing every word and the music sounded clear and beautiful.
i will be buying these again as gifts.
i give them two thumbs up!
earbuds in general do not hold up for long.
and much of the time there is little difference between a twenty dollar pair and a fifty dollar pair.
my last earbuds cost thirty dollars and lasted about six months.
this pair is half the cost
and i must say i find very little difference in sound.
"overall good quality for fifteen dollars, however they are not the most comfortable earbuds to wear."
"keep that in mind, especially if you are going to be walking around while using them."
i’m not a big stereo  
professor
but i’ve heard more lyrics and background stuff that i’ve never heard before.
it’s a great experience thinking you have heard it before and realize there was more to the song that you’ve never heard.
you cannot put a price on on your best song and hear something you didn’t realize was there....
totally worth the price and a quality product to boot
headphones without a mic!
i just wanted to be able to listen to my guided meditations and music every once in awhile.
not fight a stupid mic/volume control that would keep launching all my music apps and constantly adjust the volume up and down.
doesn't really help with mindfulness.these are just headphones and they sound pretty good for the price
the quality of looks and feel are very good.  
my earbuds came with different plugs for different size ears.  
"i tried them all, but it didn't make much difference.  "
not much bass at all.  
sound quality was severely lacking.  
the ear buds that came free with
my apple ipod sound better than these.  
"a waste of money, but i will keep them for a back up, just because i hate returning things of low value."
product arrived as advised in nice quality packaging.  
"inside the box, which i keep to store them in, was some nice accessories."
"sound quality is great compared to earbuds of a similar, and even more expensive price point.  "
"the look and feel of these do make you feel like you have a quality, well built product.  "
my only complaint and
"it is minor, is that even using the smallest size ear piece covers, it feels too big for my ear canal."
i got these to augment using the earbuds that came with my apple i-pod.  
these have decent sound quality but are not all that comfortable --  
the padding feels thin and i am concerned the padding will come off in my ears --  and interestingly they send several extra plastic earbud pads
......  
i had a cheap pair ($4.99) from a discount store and they were just as good.
"i always buy bose in-ear headphones for $100, but when i saw these i figured what the hell, and ordered them.  "
i am very impressed - for the cost they sound like much more expensive earbuds.  
i wear these a lot
and they are very comfortable.  
highly recommended
i purchased these headphones for my husband for his birthday.
he is very pleased with the sound.
he has told me many times now that they sound great.
they come with a little velvet bag for safe keeping.
he always keeps them in their little bag and is very protective of them.
that's how i know he really likes them.
he has four or five sets of headphones in a drawer by his chair and this set he uses everyday
"and they have not yet, after a month, been stuck in the drawer."
i was skeptical at first.
i bought a couple of budget earphones from a rabbit hole of headphone reviews i found myself in.
i've gambled on $100 phones before with disappointing results.
i figured $50 a several budget ones is not a terrible investment for an experiment.
among them was the panasonic rp-hje125-a. i totally loved those ones.
cheap with no bells and whistles.
gave them a 5.
these actually beat them.
they have a much fuller sound.
i have zero complaints.
"the only things i noticed that could be a con to some are that the cord is kind of heavy and you can feel it pulling the pieces out of the ear and that in a quiet room, the quietest volume is louder than most(at least on my moto z)."
"for some of my music, when i wanted to turn it down more, i was already at lowest volume and next step was mute."
i listen to very intricate jazz at low volumes.
pros:
these look
"amazingthey come with three extra ear buds other than the ones already on, so you've got a variety to choose fromcons: although they're sleek-looking, when you put them in your ears"
they're actually quite bulky.
it's ridicilous looking honestly
"i don't think i'd wear this in publicso the sound quality is good, but when there are quiet notes or not much noise going on, you can hear space-y sounds."
"like, sort of  airy empty background ambient sound."
it's very annoying*note: i gave it 4stars for durability because it's required to rate it
but i haven't actually tested it long enough*
these headphones are amazing!
i can feel the base and acoustics are clear and crisp.
pros:
"good, deep base"
you can
feelcrisp vocals and clean acousticscord is long enough to have in pant pocket
"and it not stretchgood noise cancellationgood, strong materials,"
high qualityno damage to cord after being in pocket for hundreds of usescons: foam tips on the ear buds come off in pocket.
these are the first nearly total noise dampening earbuds i have ever used.  
the different buds were easy to put on and take off to ensure the best fit.  
i am using these for in-ear monitoring and they work great.  
i will probably purchase another set with a mic to use with my phone.
really nice product.
"also, the packaging is top notch.  "
hardshell box with magnetic closure and storage bag.
i was impressed with the range
the bass boosting was able to produce.
i am not one for loud bass though so they are a bit overpowering to me and feel like the mids suffer.
i was listening while i had a fan on me and the sound of the air/wire moving was amplified and sent to my ear which was very annoying.
i can't just ignore it personally.
"i used to only use skull candy ear buds, but then i found this gem!"
"great price, sounds almost as good as one of the 70$ plus head phones i own."
ok the awesome part is the bass!!!
"you can really hear the lows, and when the volume is all the way up"
"it tickles your ear drum, very loud, very clear and stylish if you like that sort of thing."
this the 2nd pair that i bought.
check
which one
"you are getting first, there’s one with the microphone and one without it, i messed up and ordered one without it"
but it’s
still a great buy!
whole heartedly recommend these to anyone who is a beat fiend
"these sound pretty good, especially for the price."
"however, the noise cancelling earbuds also made by betron sound really great for only about three dollars more."
"i was asked to rate the bass, but i honestly didn't really pay attention to the bass."
keeping these as pretty nice backups to the nose cancelling ones.
i have to compare with my previous earbuds that are no longer available at amazon.
they were very comfortable and never hurt me.
unfortunately these ones just hurt my ears.
i have tried them for 2 days now on and off and i can't get used to them because they make my ears sore and they fall out all the time.
it must be their  design.
very disappointed.
unbelievable!!!
the packaging was so well presented.
i literally felt guilty to take them out of the box.
lol.
they fit really comfortably.
that was my biggest concern along with bass quality.
the sound quality is on point and the bass sounds like the actual song.
"so just in case you expect these to enhance the bass of your music, it didn't do that for me."
it sounded just as the actual music.
that's why i love it though.
it doesn't mess with the audio quality of my music.
crisp and accurate sound.
"love, love, love."
will definitely be giving these for gifts at christmas.
i have been through so many different brands of earbuds.
"no matter how much more i spent on them, none of them would ever even last me through a year."
i'm super hard on earbuds.
i bought these on a whim after my samsung headphones went out because i just liked the look of them and read a few very positive reviews.
"let me just say, i looooove these earbuds."
the sound is fabulous; so much better than any skullcandys i've ever had.
they are also super stylish and don't tangle up as easily as others i have had because of the cord material.
these have also lasted me 8 months so far.
i will probably never buy another brand again.
these are good headphones for people who want to upgrade from inexpensive headphones.
the bass can be very heavy at times but it is good.
"if you are looking for headphones that sound good when listening to primarily treble range music, then you should look elsewhere."
"i'm an orchestra woodwind player and when i went to listen to some of my favorite symphony pieces and operas, the instruments and voices sounded not original."
almost muffled.
"i had a pair of sony ex mdr15 earbuds, and i was able to hear each and every instrument and their tone colors."
almost like i was back in my rehearsals.
"however, they broke in less than a year.  "
these earbuds are good for bass lovers
"but, if you love the treble range and want that nice, rich and open sound in the high voices, keep doing research."
i had  a pair of beats that finally the wiring wore out on left side so only right side worked.
after researching amazon found these betron ysm1000 earbuds.
am blown away from the manufacturing and durability aspects  of this product.
cost is amazing as well.
and the noise cancelling and sound caliber are as good as the beats.
very happy!!
"the description for these earbuds is a little misleading as they are not extremely ""bass-y""."
"if it is a lot of bass you want, these probably won't be the buds for you."
"if you desire crisp, clean sound through the highs and lows, then look no further."
my 8 yr old daughter tried these on and loves them.
"and since it does not have the ear drum busting bass, i am comfortable letting her use them."
looks like i will need to purchase another pair.
i've been using these for awhile now.
they are fairly durable (accidentally washed and dried them).
sound is good but you have to jam them in your ear to get the full audio effect
(and for them stay in your ear).
so much so that sometimes it feels like i have swimming ear plugs in.
they are starting to fall apart now but still work like new.
i have bought countless headphones.
i have an iphone and hate the earbuds they sell.
these betrons have good sound quality and stay in my ears.
i have had them 4 or 5 months with no problems.
i bought beats and within a month one side stopped working.
these are still kicking loud and proud.
dropped my kindle and bent the head of these ear phones.
not a good thing
but they still work.
ear buds are large and good for sitting and listening to a story.
they don't work as well if you are moving around unless you screw them into your ears to try to hold them in.
their weight is the problem there.
sound is fine.
highly recommend.
i bought a second pair to replace the ones i bent but still use the bent ones.
they turned out to be tougher
"then i first thought,"
these earbuds came exactly as advertised.
"they are well made, quality constructed and  came with"
all the accessories promised.
"most importantly, the sound quality is excellent."
"deep bass, very little distortion at high volumes.  "
in my opinion these arethe hands down best earbuds for less then $100.
all the bigger brand names do not even compare.
"i would by them again, no doubt.  "
"the only thing some people might not like is they are a bit heavy, but to me that is a mark of heavy duty construction."
the sound quality is fine.
"not bad, not amazing."
works for me.
"it's very cheaply made though, and fell apart after a few moths of use."
now i'm having to find a different pair to buy.
"if you're looking for something that's going to last a while, these might not be your best bet."
pros:-nonecons:-the 4 different sized rubber adapters are larger and stiffer than any other earbuds.
they do not fit my ears.-the foam adapter is the most uncomfortable thing ever.-these are the only headphones that i've ever had that have died within the first month of getting them.
"one minute they are fine, and the next a random side will stop working entirely.-sound quality is as good as my phone speaker, and my speaker is punctured from metal chips from 3 years of cnc machining.-the glue used to hold these together seems like it was almost dried before they even assembled them, the inner plates fell out within the first month."
i delayed writing this review because when i first tried them they seemed kind of large fitting in my ears.
even with the smallest rubber buds on.
but i eventually got used to them and are quite pleased with this purchase.
the only reason i didn't give 5 stars is because the straight jack input.
i use these primarily on my lap top and the straight jack often gets caught on things.
compared to my old ones that had a 90 degree jack.
"sound wise, these are definitely superior to any other ear buds i've used before."
i am 57 and i find myself asking people to repeat what they've said more often than i like.
that being said these ear buds feel substantial.
"not heavy, they just have the feel of good materials."
the sound seems to be good
but i can't be a good judge of that.
if i had the need i would buy another set.
got wireless ear buds for my granddaughter
but she felt it wasn't cool to not have wired earbuds connected to her smart phone.  
got several as she goes thru the wired earbuds pretty quickly since most of them have very thin wires that don't hold up to any kind of abuse.  
she likes them
and i inherited the wireless buds.  
good trade
i’ve had my betron 1000’s for a few weeks now
and i love them more and more.
so much so that i plan to get them for a couple of music lovers in my family for gifts!
awesome indeed!
still 5 stars!i must say the bass was overwhelming when i tried these ysm 1000s for the first time.
then i remembered a reviewer saying he used an equalizer to tone down the bass.
for the first time i went to sounds on my i phone and low and behold...
there was an equlizer setting.
i found the one that i liked and now enjoy the best listening experience ever on a pair of earbuds!
i’m totally satisfied and would definitely recommend!
"after researching earphone options, i noticed betron's ad."
"i read several reviews and specs on several models, and decided on the ysm1000 model."
they are exactly what i needed and they sound great.
they had a sale going to boot
so that was an added bonus.
i have purchased many brands of earphones and so far betron'shas stood the test of the usual abuse.
betron will be my go to company when making future purchases.
"great product, service, and reasonable prices."
thank you betron.
gcg
the earbuds were a bit bottom heavy and it was hard to use them when exercising (
though that's probably not the recommended use).
"i did enjoy the sound quality, though, but after about 6 to 8 months, the wires on the connecting to one of the earbuds came a bit loose on the inside and the sound comes and goes."
hi..
"i don't know what happened, but i already submitted a review."
"regardless, i love these earbuds..."
"they are crisp,clear and dominate!"
i was offered a brand new pair of d .dre..
for similar money and did not like them at all.
.and
then i heard yours.
apple made a huge mistake.
i actually was considering purchasing an additional pair soon for back up.
by far superior to the outrageously overpriced d de....5*for betron.. keep it up.
thx
..r.w.rice
"the diameter on these seems to be a tiny bit wider than some of my other earbuds, so my ears ache a little after an hour or so."
that could just be me though.
"besides that, the sound is amazing."
i compared these to my bose over the ear headphones and they were similar.
i’m on my second set and the first set lasted almost 2 years.
it’s surprising
these don’t cost more.
the noise canceling properties are fire.
supreme sound quality with great bass for the size.
i wish betron would be able to sell the set of replacement buds i purchased from ebay.
for some reason they can’t sell them in the us.
it took 3 months for them get to me by mail.
but better than any replacement buds i have found.
use the foam for best noise canceling.
"these are quality, even better than other more expensive brands."
these feel great and have fantastic sound for the price.
"my only (huge) gripe is that whenever shifting in your seat, the static discharge finds its way from the metal of these headphones to your ears and can be pretty painful."
"i find myself shifting very carefully by habit, even if i'm not wearing them, because getting your ears repeatedly shocked hurts pretty bad."
"i loved my first pair of these that sounded awesome until my dog decided to modify them for me,  oh well i will just reorder them..."
what i recieved was not the same pair of headphones.  
look like knock offs and didn't even come with the same nice little pouch.  
music is tinny and very disappointing.
came in a box labeled plextone rich bass not the same set.
love the look and comfort of these headphones.
the sound is great for the price.
the cord doesn't tangle like other brands.
"they came with 4 sets of rubber earbuds (3 gray & 1 black) in different sizes, a clip and carrying case."
i ordered these without really looking at the details
so i assumed they had a volume control/mic on the cord in the photo....
"unfortunately, they don't."
"other than that, they are great for the price."
way better than the apple ones they give you with your phone or when you don't want to wear bulky over ear headphones.
these earbuds are without a doubt the best i've put in my ears!
"i've bought skullcandy ink'd, klipsch r6, shure se315 and various others that came with cell phones."
the ysm1000's are very bass heavy but also have a nice full range when used in conjuntion with an eq.
they are also very loud with no distortion unless you are partially deaf and need to push the volume.
"i find them to be the best at any price point, much less for $13."
"jeez man, you can't beat that with a stick!any problem other reviewers have with these earbuds are plain silly."
"get these earbuds, download a decent eq and you will achieve aural nirvana!"
"i didn't think i could afford a good set of earbuds, so every couple months when the current set broke"
i just bought whatever $15-$20 option there was at walgreens.
little
did i know that a fantastic set could be had for the same price.
"i'm not a pedantic audiophile, so i can't tell you about fancy levels and stuff, but these sound great and the sound cancelling works well in the dense city i live in."
highly recommend.
i bought this first pair for myself and i was so impressed with sound quality and all areas feel of the ear buds.
perfect in earbud size and length of cord.
my kids wanted a pair
so i ordered another pair of the exact ones just different color
unfortunately the color is
no different and sound quality is not so good its completely lacking bass.
im puzzled as to why they are different.
the sound quality of these headphones rivals their higher-priced competition.
they look as good in person as they do in the pictures and are well made from quality materials.
these are not simple plastic headphones.  
the packaging is frustration free (
no rigid plastics for the consumer to saw though) and very professional looking.  
"for the price, it's worth giving them a try!  "
highly recommended.
i was impressed with the look and feel of these headphones when they came in.
the wire and metal detail looked to be high quality.
i was pretty let down the first time i used them though.
"my old apple earbuds have a much crisper sound, as well as better bass."
"these betron was heavy treble, and the sound was alright, but did not have a patch on my older apple ones."
"i'd like to give this a straight 4-star review, but i've only used these headphones 2 now."
"every time i haven't used them, i kept them in the little pouch they came with for protection."
i've tried to use them in three different media devices and only one side of the earphones worked.
"there should be absolutely no reason these aren't working, and they're not.... very disappointing."
"as i said in the title, these earbuds have great sound, the bass response is excellent."
"part of the success of these buds, at least for me, is the great fit."
"no airspaces between my ear and these buds, and there's no  annoying lip or offset near the base that some buds have, which can sometimes prevent them from going far enough into the ear."
the great fit really helps with the bass response.  
"and the microphone sounds fine, but not quite as good as my red skullcandy earbuds."
theyre a nice looking pair of in ear head phones.
none of the provided earbuds are really comfortable for my ears
but i have that issue with many brands.
my main issue is that i have owned my own pair for only a little over a month and one of the earbuds popped off the wire after i had tugged them over my backpack with very slight force.
makes me glad i bought the warranty
but i have never had that happen to be with other in ear headphones of the lower and higher price.
used to only buy skullcandy..
i've been making a mistake.
"listening to music, you need these puppies."
i mean i'm not a dj or a musician
but i've bought a lot of headphones and ear buds and these are a freaking steal.
i just bought another pair to give someone else.

this was the worst pair of headphones i've purchased.
right went
i got the headphones
the part that plugs in bent.  
sound came in and out.
"i constantly had to twist the headphones, while in the jack, to fet any sound."
eventually the part the goes into the jack
broke off in my tablet
and i have to get it out piece by piece.  
this took a few months.
problem started just weeks into when i bought them.
these earbuds are great.
the elegant packaging make them an impressive gift.
quality build of product.
comes with a nice carrying pouch.
sound quality is spot on.
"went to sleep with them on, when i woke up they were still in place."
no tangeling at all.  
best earbuds at this  price point by far.
they look and sound like $100.00 plus earbuds.
highly recommend.
"my family and i have a quaint home and when the children are doing homework, i need to be quiet"
(talk about role reversal!)
", so i now listen to investing podcasts with my headphones on."
i am very happy with the way it fits in my ear and
the extra earbud covers were a nice addition.  
they seem to be well made.
"i used these headphones 2 times over the course of 1 month, always keeping them in a container when not in-use, went to use them a 3rd time and the left earbud no longer works and its past their return date."
"when they worked they sounded ok, just a little disappointing that they broke for seemingly no reason."
i've been testing out these headphones for two weeks now
and i can say that these are pretty good.
"the sound quality is great for these types of headphones with no static or fuzziness, and the bass is a small but nice touch(though if you want something with better bass i'd recommend looking for headsets that go over the ears rather than in the canal)."
they're also an eyecatcher with the gold accents
(i can't tell if it's actual gold though) and transparent cord.
"the packaging is also great, as it opens like a book and holds the headphones and replacement earbuds if needed."
"in conclusion, i can safely recommend these to anyone who needs some quality headphones."
needed another pair of earbuds for use at the gym after my etymotics (rather expensive) quit.
these had very good reviews
and i can see why.
"highs are crisp, bass is great and for the price, they cannot be beat."
buy them again in a heartbeat.
i have a set of over ear headphones but wanted to purchase some earbuds with quality sound for walking and going to the gym.  
i didn't want wireless or anything with a microphone.  
this set was just what i was looking for at a great price.  
they fit perfect and are much more convenient to take out of the house than my larger over the ear phones.
"nice earbuds, but one side stopped working after about three months."
"i use my headphones heavily for listening to podcasts and music and tend to stuff them in my purse instead of neatly tucking them away in their little pouch, so perhaps i'm to blame."
"however, soon after, i bought a pair of hypergear earbuds on sale for $9.99 with even better noise-cancelling and they have been working reliably for over a year now, despite my rough treatment."
"i also recommend amazon basic wireless headphones, but i like to have a wired backup pair for when the battery dies."
amazingly good sound and build quality for earbuds this inexpensive.
would be a bargain at twice the price!
"in fact, i doubt i could tell the difference in sound quality against the most expensive earbuds."
"i think you would have to consider yourself an ""audiophile"" before you would notice."
i have been looking for headphones for a while.
"i tried all kinds, the sound was off, some too low bass some no bass and just nothing good in sound quality."
the sound and bass was perfect for what i was looking for.
as an audio engineer this was a surprise to find some good quality sound without spending hundreds on headphones.
i will be buying a couple more for christmas gifts.
"this was a christmas present for my wife, who had a history of going through earbuds at a high rate, and being dissatisfied with the quality of those she'd bought in the past."
she
*loves*
the betron earbuds.
"the fit is perfect, the sounds quality is top-notch, and she is amazed that they never end up tangled in her purse."
excellent!
the backs of these earbuds are so heavy that they don't stay in the ear.  
both my husband
"and i tried all the included tip sizes, but the earbuds were constantly breaking the seal and falling out."
"there are many big companies out there that will insure that you will have the best sound ever, but don't keep that promise."
"i have been true to skullcandy for about 4 years, i have had buds from bose to beats."
"betron being a new company i had to be optimistic,"
the moment my package arrived
i knew i was in for a surprise!
"they sounded phenomenal, you can have foam and or sysnthetic inserts."
i will buy betron headphones for as long as they produce them.
i can't believe how great these earbuds sounded!
i decided to take a chance and get these earbuds instead of a name brand item.
i'm glad i did!
these buds actually sound better than some higher priced items: they are definitely noise isolating.
they are absolutely brilliant for traveling and won't weigh you down like over the ear headphones.
these buds come in a little carrying case and sansa clip size mp3 players fit in perfectly.
"my version does not have a mic, so it can't be used for calls, but i only bought it for listening.  "
a really great purchase: recommend.
"i have bought these headphones 3 times now for my son, as he seems to be incompetion for them with our dog, who eqally likes them.  "
"but admitidly, they are too small for my dogs ears.  "
"so speaking for my son, he favors them above all others that i have purchased for them."
"the headphones have a metallic feel to them, giving them a more expensive look and feel."
the sound quality is great for the price.
"also, the box that the headphones came in was sleek and nice looking (think google products)."
"only complaint is that the ear pieces could be a little lighter, however, i expect i will get used to this, and it will no longer be a problem."
"the headphones have a metallic feel to them, giving them a more expensive look and feel."

"only complaint is that the ear pieces could be a little lighter, however, i expect i will get used to this, and it will no longer be a problem."
"the price on these is great for what you get: good not great sound quality that can get loud, which is a plus."
it feels durable and for months now has held up.
"comes with varying sizes for ear bud gels for all ear sizes, which i need for my small ears as the stock ones are too large."
"if your looking for solid headphones at a cheap price i very much recommend them, just don't expect bose over here."
purchased product july 2018.
have used exclusively for my daily walks for the past six months.
the right ear bud no longer provides any audio.
can't complain too much as i only paid $15.99 for them.
"checked out product and price has gone up, and complaints about product quality are spot on."
can't seem to get a year out of any pair of ear buds.
oh well.
"these head phone are decent quality, especially for the price.  "
"good range, etc.  "
they're better than the apple ear buds
"(but... that's not saying much).one side of mine developed a short after about 6 months, but i use them a lot.  "
almost every day for the last 3 months
", so... i'm not sure how much of that is the fault of the headphones."
"actually got these for the wife, as she listens to her stone (yes, an antique mp3 player) often and goes thru the cheaper drugstore earphones quickly.  "
"she loves how these fit in her ear, the sound quality is excellent, and so far, after several months use, they still work and the cord hasn't broken.  "
was worth the cost for the quality.
they sound pretty decent especially for the price.
then build quality is pretty solid.
overall performance is decent.
"however, they are so uncomfortable."
the metal bud hurts your ear and they tend to fall out constantly.
honestly there are better options out there.
this product is top notch as the construction is one to none!nothing compares to betron earbuds quality.
metal componentsreplace all plastics of other brands and the clarity of sound is wonderful.
i will be a repeat consumer in the future.
the best feature on these headphones is the jack that connects the player to the phones.
it is very sturdy metal and doesn't bend or break.
"the only trouble with these headphones in the long run, is that one side or the other stops working and"
the sound is no longer stereo.
that's why i had to purchase another one.
when you move the wires rub which translates mechanically to tons of noise.
"my cheap-o panasonic earbuds have wires made of a softer material, so the don't have this problem."
other than that these earbuds have great audio.
wow.  
"the quality of ""lower-priced"" earbuds have come a loooong way.  "
i had a pair of jlabs j5 that died after 5 tough years.  
i decided to try these ysm 1000.  
"top quality all around from the quick delivery, packaging, and most importantly = the sound.  "
"i have not ""burned"" them in (although many feel this is bs, and not necessary), but the first hour on a long run has been amazing.  "
very comfortable.  
"go for it,  you won't be disappointed."
i am very impressed by the build quality.
"with the construction being of metal though, ambient temperatures need to taken into consideration."
"for instance, dont leave them in a hot car and expect to use them right away because they get quite warm."
the only real complaint was with the mid range frequency.
"i found it a lacking, but it was an easy fix by adjusting the eq on my note 9 phone."
i think i would have been more disappointed if i didnt have a multiband eq to adjust the sound though.
aside from that the low end frequency meets expectations and the highs were very clear.
all in all a good product for a great value.
was looking for a replacement for an old pair of skull candy earphones that died.  
i bought two styles of betron headphones which included the ysm1000 set.  
"these are very well constructed, comfortable and the sound is superb.  "
the leads are a bit lighter in weight than on my other dc950 betron's and i tend to wear these around the house more.
these are freaking awesome!
"i have had to resort to buying cheap until i found a good pair, these are endgame."
"absolutely phenomenal sound quality, metal is stunning on these, not tinny, hollow, or plastic sounding."
nice bass to it.
i don't have them turned up
but maybe half way where i would other headphones.
noise cancelling is superb.
i myself recommend these.
to whom it may concern.
i have never used earbuds before.
i wanted to try something new and these had so many good reviews that i ordered them
i thought since they were so cheap that they would not sound good at all.
i put them on and i was shocked on how good they sounded for the price.
i would recommend them.
i got these as a replacement for my old (more than 5 years old) apple earphones.  
i'm very happy with them.  
mostly listen to movies and podcasts.  
sound is great - requires much less power
(i need to turn the volume down a bit when i plug them
in).overall
i would buy them again.  
quite happy with the product.
"got em in january, now it’s"
june
"and they just started doing that thing where the sound cuts out when you rotate the headphone jack, which usually happens before stopping working entirely."
expected at least a few more months of use at this price point
"so i’m a bit disappointed, especially since there’s no damage to it at all, it just gave out."
"also, the sale price is misleading, it’s always been that price and the quality reflects that."
"you’re getting a $20 pair of headphones, nothing more."
"i read a lot of comments regarding about the sound quality, well..."
after months of usage i can tell the experience it's pretty solid; mid and high pitches are nice; the bass is amazingly good and since i prefer bass driven music i was satisfied.
the box includes a few pairs of silicone caps so you can switch those for comfort .
the material quality feels a little bit cheap but all in all (considering the price)
these ones are good for anyone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money.
"i forgot these earbuds in my pocket a couple of times (as i do with every pair) and they survived many washes, but they do not last through the dryer very well."
i had them for a very long time (for earbuds) and they had really good sound quality as well as external noise blocking.
"i love that they're metal too, never had metal earbuds before this and honestly, they are awesome."
i am a headphones junky.
always buying headphones
and then the cord will break
and then i would have to buy some more again.
the sound of these headphones are crisp and loud.
just hoping that they last.
i'm learning to take more care of my headphones instead of just stuffing them away or throwing them around.
great sound for the price.
visually striking compared to any other set of headphones that i've owned.
the best part about all of this though is the fact that this product comes from a family owned business that stands by its products and is very customer oriented.
"i purchased an extended warranty that actually covers damage, and i plan on buying another pair for backup in case i need to send them off."
the headphones also come with an attractive carrying pouch that help protect them when not in use.
i expect to get good use out of these guys.
2018 august update:  one full year later and still working.  
nor many of my prior earbuds can say the same.  
here is the original 2017 review ...
"these days the under $50 headphones have been getting better and better, so when i saw this well rated $40 earbud discounted to $20, i decided to take a chance.  "
i have poor tolerance for bad earbuds  and have tossed out more than a few pairs rather than let them ruin my music.  
"so for $20, i figured it was was worth taking a chance.  "
"when i tried it, my reaction was wow!  "
"this is good, very good.  "
it reproduces great music that is loud and clear.
"in fact, it's louder than all of my other earbuds.  "
"it hit's the highs, the midrange, and some of the base ."
"most importantly, the singers voice are sharp and clear."
"even at $40, it would be worth the money.  "
so what does doesn't it do?.
you noticed
"i said ""some of the base."
"""  "
"it gets enough bass for easy listening and you'll definitely know it's there, but it wont shake your head, rock your socks, or kick your boots.  "
a few of my other headphones get more bass.  
"however, for under $50, i have to trade off something, volume, clarity, highs, mid-range, or bass.  "
"if you want to get all of this, you'll need to buy a bose soundsport pulse or another $200 earbud.  "
"(i haven't tried all of the pricey buds, but i just tried out the soundsport pulse this morning.  "
"i'd love to have one, but it's way outside"
"my budget.)2018 updateorignal ""good earbud should last at least a year.  "
"if it doesn't make the cut, i will update this rating."
"""  "
it's august 2018
and they are still going strong.  
it made the cut.
"bought it on sale, looked like a quality product, but it is far from that."
even the ear buds
it comes with suck and fall out of my ear easily.
noise cancelling is more like when you push them in your ear
"you are greeted with a loud, ear drum bursting pressure click feature which actually physically hurts."
worst purchase i've made in a long time.
"didn't do any research, do yourself a favor and buy something else."
these really aren't good.
i bought a pair for my nintendo switch.
i decided to try them on my tablet while listening to imagine dragons and was impressed by the bass.
so impressed
"i bought 3 more, one for my wife and the others for gifts."
the retail box they came in is impressive.
the ear buds came with a carrying pouch with extra rubber ear pieces.
"if you want great sound on a budget, i highly recommend."
the aux tip became loose and they stopped working in a little over a month.  
i checked on warranty for the item
but the site i went to had scan written all over it.
they should not need my amazon  security code after i give them my order number.
"betron, if you would like this review changed, contact me with a way to warranty."
"i purchased this item on august 21, 2017."
it is perfect for watching tv with headphones.
one major problem is that the headphones are heavy because they're metal
so they easily fall out of your ears
but i managed.
"for the past six months, there has been a problem with the left earbud with sound getting cut off and today the left earbud completely stopped working."
i purchased a square trade extended warranty but they don't have betron under the list of manufacturers on their website.
"these are excellent, particularly given the reasonable price.  "
i have never seen a better one for anywhere near the price of these.  
highest recommendation.  
"great sound, and really put together well for good durability."
my husband and i are musicians
these are the best ones we have used to hear all the layers of the music.
"after about 6 months or so one side stopped working, but let me tell you i emailed the company and within a week i had a replacement!"
that is impressive!
i won't ever buy another type than these.
i was very impressed by these ear buds.
extremely nice quality and sound.
"not excellent in the noise cancellation department, but good enough for what i am using them for."
i would purchase these again and recommend them to anyone.
"i got this since i use earbuds alot, like pretty much everyday and these had good reviews."
but it turns out the durability is total trash.
only a few months in and its already bent with audio cutting in and out.
"i got this in october, thats terrible."
hell even the $9 skull candy buds would last me ay least half a year.
dont bother with these.
"generally, i like these headphones."
ill give you some pros and cons.
pros:
"clear sound, good presentation, good built."
cons:
"earbuds don't really fit in ear, american version of packaging has little amount of extra ear tips."
"finally about the bass, its not as heavy as i thought"
but in general its quite good.
i have owned jvc xx  hafx1x before and its bass was superior than this.
"these are the best sounding earbud headphones i have heard, including brands that are close to $90."
"excellent sound, very balanced.  "
the cord is reinforced tangle free too.  
"i got these for my wife and bought a couple more expensive ones on prime day sale for myself, but once i heard these i kept them for myself, the others sit in their boxes."
"i love it, sound is really good,"
"what i love the most even if the music is off  you need to take it out of your ear to hear what people is saying to you, wonderful"
i don't have to pretend that i can't hear....
lol
"i love the sound these put out, especially for the price."
however i have had to change out the neoprene or whatever material
the earpieces are at least 5 times.
"other than that part, the headphones are unbeatable for the price."
"i purchased these earbuds about 5 months ago, and they were amazing."
"great sound quality, great bass, and noise isolating."
"about 4 weeks ago the left earbud randomly stopped working for no reason, but i wasn’t worried since i’d bought a 4-year protection plan."
"the one thing i can tell you about betron is that they do not respond to your emails, and they will not help you whatsoever."
"i emailed them with my order number 3 times, and they haven’t responded."
"overall, great sound, not very durable, and terrible customer support."
after only 1 month of slight use the headphones barely outputted sound.
"i contacted betron as they claim to have “vip” support, but i got no response."
they are based in the u.k.
and they ignored my requests for support.
a waste of money.
terrible company!
i purchased these headphones.
"i am a professional musician, i record music, and i listen to all types."
for the price these headphones are excellent.
"they lack depth in the low frequencies, but they are loud and clear."
good for the car or in public places where there is noise to compete with..
edit:
"after a few weeks of using this pair, i've gone back to my old earbuds."
i couldn't get used to how poor these sound.
"the headphone build has a very premium feel to it and they look very nice, but the sound is just kind of average."
"the bass comes through well but vocals, mids and highs are muddy and washed out."
the cheap skullcandies that i were using before this pair actually sounded much better.
these are not stereo but that's okay for me because i got them only to use when my blue tooth head set is charging.
"best customer service in all of amazon land,"
"right ear volume went real low, contacted them"
and they sent me another pair without no other action.
that is beyond any cs ever.
my son loves these...
he's a lot like me and likes several headphones to choose from.
these are now at the top of his list and daily use!great buy!
great fit!
great sound!
great bass!
love them!
these earbuds are wonderful.
"after trying several mid-range priced earbuds and returning them, i found these."
a real bargain.
the sound is exactly what i was hoping for.
"it has a good beefy cable that seems less likely to break and cheap ones, only downside is that the driver is wider than others, making it a little more difficult to find the perfect silicone cushion that fits your ears."
"once you find the that works for you, you will be happy with these"
i am sure.
"these sound fantastic, though i usually use them to listen to podcasts so look to other reviews for sound quality."
minus one star because the plugin was too big for my case.
i used a razor blade on my phone case to widen the opening.
also notice there is no sound control-
"you must pull out your phone to adjust volume, pause etc."
i'm blown away!
"so, here's the deal."
i'm a flight attendant
and i commute
so i'm sitting on airplanes constantly
and it's important to have have headphones that drown everything out when i'm not working.
i've gone thru hundreds of headphones in my career.
these just blew everything out of the water i've ever owned.
i don't get it.
they weren't even expensive.
i'm hooked!
this is an excellent product.  
i bought this for international traveling.  
it is used for noise reduction and watch inflight movies.  
i compared this with a sony earbud i purchased a few years back.  
the sound quality reflected true movie sound.  
"if you put this on before take off, you should not have any hearing  issue after landing.  "
i recommend to several friends and they all had the same response.
bought a set for my wife...
when i checked them out the sound quality was excellent..
i am am bit deaf from 26 years in the army..
the earphones  have clear sound
and i can understand every word...
the fit is excellent...
the price excellent...
i would recommended these even over skull candy..
these are the best headphones i've ever bought.
"usually, for me, headphones break within 2-3 months with daily use, if not sooner--even the ones advertised as durable and long lasting."
i have tried probably a dozen different brands looking for a pair that wouldn't crap out so soon while also being comfortable and having good sound quality.
"betrons have gone above and beyond the rest in terms of quality and comfort, and are on par with most other brands for sound quality."
"oh and the little rubber tips rarely fall off, as opposed to the other brands i've tried that fall off every other use."
i bought these heavier duty earphones because i walk a lot especially near traffic.  
these are awesome:
"clear, great bass, well balanced sound.  "
very comfortable...
put them in once and didn't have to mess with.  
they seem to block out a lot of outside noise too.  
glad
i bought a second pair.  
for the price they're great!
these earbuds sound great.
nice bass response and comfortable feel.
extra ear cushions are provided to ensure a snug fit.
"the bass resonse is impressive, no joke."
you just have to push them deep into your ear hole to get a good sonic seal.
otherwise they can sound tinny at no fault of their own.
i recommend these highly.
got these for my old ipod mini to replace some sony ones i loved.
"tried more expensive models, but these had the best bass, way better than a $100 pair."
"wish the cord were flat because these do tangle, but the sound is worth it."
"they look good, but that's it.- i couldn't wear these for"
"more than 30 minutes.- drivers are not that bad, but they come horribly equalized."
"sound quality is poor, sounds muffled and not clear at all."
"you can kinda fix this if your device has equalizer, if not wouldn't recommend at all, and even if so, there are better options.- build quality seems good, but haven't had this for too long, and many reviews say that they stop working after some time."
"this is the 2nd pair of buds that i have purchased from this brand, i had a pair of bose before i  would say the over all quality is better, wonderful; sound and if not running over the last pair with my chair, the last pair would be still in service (5 years later)"
these sound fine to me and are very comfortable for every day use.
"they are not very secure, but i use them sitting at a desk"
so it doesn’t matter.
"unfortunately, they have not held up well."
after less than a year of use the wire mesh on the inside and outside of the earphones are falling out.
"while i knew they weren’t high end headphones, i hoped for better than 9-10 months of use."
all mid no bass - sounds is very thin and flat with iphone..
i’m using these as my backup emergency pair only  for my laptop where i can sorta help them by using an equalizer
"very nice, work and sound very good."
"would be nice to have a clothes clip on the cord to help hold things secure while walking as the cord coupler piece is heavy, read as well made."
still very nice.
"purchased these for the spouse, she instructed me to give them a 5 star review, she seems to be satisfied with every aspect of these ear phones, i too am happy, simply because i no longer have to listen to her music."
"when i purchased these headphones they kept slipping off after 5 minutes of use without moving my body in any form, so i can only imagine how often it would slip off for someone with a big ear canal."
i had to really shove the buds in there
"and it created this uncomfortable pressure that displeased my listening experience,"
"so i had to wrap the wire over my ear and then put them on to negate the slipping, even though they still slipped."
"these seem to be a good value, as they work well, are comfortable, and quite affordable."
"i originally bought them to be my gym headphones, but they won't work for that, as they slip out too easily if i am active (fine otherwise)."
using them for the office instead.
"have been using these for about one week now, daily for about 6-8 hours at a time."
"so far so good,"
no issues and nothing i would change.
i have actually gotten compliments and questions about the earbuds/company because of the look of them.
they also come with a nice simple case for when they are not being used.
i hope these last
and i can continue to enjoy.
as a hearing impaired person i am very critical of headphones that have the right amount of balance in their audio output.  
the thing that i love about these earbuds are that you don't have to turn the voume all the way up if you want to hear clearly.  
this allows for clear and concise listening.  
when working out with these buds the chord is extrememly flexible and lightweight
so there isn't this feeling of heaviness when wearing them.  
they fit really well in my ear when i would jump up and down and haven't fallen out rarely.  
plus the gold looks pretty slick and they seem to be very durable.
i am a radio producer and it's imperative that i have quality ear buds.
i went from over the ear headsets some time back and never found earbuds that were comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time.
these are durable and perfect for my work.
if you have tiny ears like me...they fit great!
i am hearing impaired.  
that may disqualify my opinion
....that's ok.  
"but, these earphones allow me to hear with an accuracy i have not enjoyed in years !"
these are great little ear buds.
especially for the price.
i'm a trained vocalist and appreciate good quality sound.
the aren't studio quality but definitely better than expected for the price point.
i only just received them so can't comment on durability.
"but at such a great price, if they last a year, i'll buy them again."
i'm not very happy with these earbuds.  
the right and left are not marked and buds the tend to fall out of my ears.  
"the sound is o.k., but not any better than cheaper ones.  "
"all in all, i'm using them, but i don't love them."
holy .....
i'm very serious about my music and my last set of earbuds
finally died.  
thank god they did
and i found these.  
what a huge difference.  
do yourself a favor and just buy these .  
you won't regret it!!!
"i’m a headphone junkie, so i’m always gonna be a bit hard on earbuds, but these aren’t bad."
"kinda fit weird and noise cancellation is definitely not something it’s strong on, but they’re functional."
the earbuds are good but they shocks me crazy when i wear shorts
and i had the earbuds for more then 2 months and one of the earbuds stoped working
and i usually use them for a couple of hours a day on music
"these earbuds are not for the average listener, unless you like crazy bass."
"these things, when turned up to full volume, rattle my ear drums with how much bass these little things put out."
"that is, if u listen to the right songs."
they still are good for normal listening and have a nice premium build quality for the price.
the gold plating on the end and the all metal buds really add to the premium feel.
they don't have quite the right fit and stick out a bunch when in the ears but its a small price to pay for how cheap they are.
"definitely a good, cheap pair of ear buds, would recommend."
i am using these for my mp3 player while i work out.  
"the sound is great, rich tones, great on both the bass and treble ends.  "
comes with extra ear cushions in other sizes.  
i am truly impressed with these headphones.
"i ordered these blind,not knowing what to expect."
i was pleasantly surprised.
they came in impressive packaging and the sound is amazing.
great little pair of earbuds.
i will order again from this seller.
these headphones have lasted me about 6 months and there still going.
value for the money is great.
great sound quality.
"i have usually small ears, so i cant use thess with the pastic part."
and the inner screen came unglued.
thank god it didn't go in my ear!
"they sounded great out of the package, however the left earbud died out in a little over a month and a half."
they're now residing in the trashcan.
spend a little extra money and get a pair of earbuds that will stand the test of time.
really really bad sound.  
i feel like i'm listening to music through a 1970's stock car radio.  
"super low bass volume/power, contrary to what's advertised.  "
terrrrrrible earphones.
earphones cannot stick in my ear no matter which buds i used
"(the earphones did come with 3 sizes of buds, plus a pair of foam tip ones) and it is extremely annoying that they keep falling out."
they are quite heavy which makes it easier for them to fall out too.
"in terms of sound, there is not much bass and the sound is quite tinny with really high treble."
"these are cheap, but there are better cheap earphones out there."
"the rest of the quality is good, wires are strong and the earphones look like they're good quality, but in the end it just didn't work out for me."
these headphones are amazing and a excellent price for 4 headphones
so far these work great.
the sound is good and they seem to be made rather well for the price.
i think they are a great buy.
they are better than some single ones i have gotten.
"bought these for a 10 hour flight to england, they worked great!  "
had movies saved on my ipad to watch.  
these made the 10 hours go by so much faster!
these have to be the best earbuds i've used yet.
i'm very picky about how they fit and sound and the large rubber seals provide the best noise isolation i've had in a long while.
the audio is crisp and clear and the bass is just right.
highly recommended to anyone looking for good quality budget earbuds.
i wasn’t expecting much
but i was expecting a bit more than this.
"they have a weird little sliding piece that is supposed to increase and decrease the volume, which for the emailing it moves is pretty useless"
and i’m not sure why it’s there.
"also, only one side works well."
the other is significantly lower in quality and volume.
"i thought i was getting a few throwaway extras for when i didn’t have my good earphones, but you’re better off just spending a few more dollars on one pair of decent ones rather than four pairs of unusable ones."
not happy at all when you walk the wires hit against your clothing they would make a lot of noise all i got was complaints
every time i used them to people said that it would hurt their ears that all they would hear was the noise of the wire hitting against my clothes and a lot of static that they couldn't hear me so i would have to take them of they
okay if your sitting down and not moving around.
i ordered the wrong one's
i wanted the first one that i ordered those where good and came 4 in a pack🙂
not one bad thing to say about this product
", i use them at work everyday and for the gym."
"i can move around at work without getting tangled in wires and can easily run, lift weights at the gym without them falling out."
they last all day without having to be charged.
"the different settings really allow you to customize the sound, and the earpieces are so comfortable!"
i would def suggest these as a great gift for the holidays and stocking stuffer! :)
"i use earbuds a lot for work phone calls, have been on the phone better part of 20 hrs / week throughout recent years."
"the mic seems fine (which is hard to come by so that is a plus), but the speaker quality is rotten, i can't describe but these are the worst i've ever had, almost hurts to have in ear and hear someone talk, my ears hurts from the sound quality."
i know i shouldn’t have bet on the deal with only 9 dollars for 4 headphones.
working worse on anti-noise and people can hear my music out loud.
"no super bass (of course), one side of one of the pairs started to get fizzle when i accidentally dropped from table to the floor."
i don’t recommend this.
purchased these for my kids and they live them!  
the variety of colors is great as it prevents arguments over who’s headphones are who’s.
so far these work great.
the sound is good and they seem to be made rather well for the price.

"if you read some of the articles/reviews of these headphones, you'll see that they talk about sound quality --"
"and yes, there are earphones that sound better than these."
"for me, though, the design quite makes up for this."
"i run with them in 90 degree weather, and they do not slip in my ears (no matter how sweaty i get, ewwwww)."
i'm also a big fan of the nifty way you can securely loop the cable; no more knots.
"if these had a volume button and the sound was a bit more crisp, i'd be willing to give them five stars."
"of course, then they would probably be more expensive, so for the money, they're a good little product."
"note that i've only been using them for about a month, so the real test will be how long they last before they start to short out."
i have been a fan of urbanears products since 2012.
i think the overall product quality is great and the price isn't expensive.
these earphones have excellent sound quality...
10/10.
"but, with this particular product, the comfort level is a 2."
the insides of my ears are small (whenever earphones come with the interchangeable silicone tips i have to choose the smallest ones or else they won't even fit in my ear).
"since these have a round shape and you are unable to change the size, they become extremely uncomfortable to wear after about 15 minutes."
"20 minutes later, i have to take them out because it hurts."
normal ear
insides = definitely buy!!
small ear insides = stay away!
"i'm on web conferences constantly, and like to listen to my music on the go."
"between work and general use, i generally go through a pair of earbuds every few months - faster, depending on the quality of cable & mic."
the past two headsets i had ordered in a similar price range ($25-50) had worse mic's and sound quality.
"especially for these being an ""external"" earbud that sits in, rather than jams in to your ear, i was surprised by how good the sound quality is."
"no tangle cord seems pretty durable, and the hook design + rubber bit to wrap the cord is pretty neat."
"so far, i'm impressed - especially for the price."
"the mic is great, and has great pick up without grabbing too much background white noise ("
eg. wind).
recommend.
i read the reviews saying that the plastic things on the buds come off easily but ignored them.
i should have listened because it's really annoying
and you only get two replacement buds--essentially making them unusable after a couple of weeks.
they're getting two stars because they did have good sound quality.
these are the newer version of urbanears.
the old version - kransen - were much better.
they fit into your ear canals and were mostly sound-isolating.
they were very comfortable.
"these are the sumpan version - the fit terribly in your ear, hurt your ear if you wear them too long, and are not isolating at all."
the rubber covers also fall off really easily.
i strongly recommend buying something else.
this is too bad since i owned 5 pairs of kransen buds before they changed the design.
"in the photo, the old version is yellow and the new version is grey."
i received a pair of already opened and possibly used headphones.
came tangled in the box and missing the spare rubber ears tips (which many users say fall off easily so it’s necessary to have the spares).
no idea if sound quality is good or not as i will not put used earbuds in my ears.
they hurt.
"the sound is good, better than most.  "
"they'll do in a pinch for a short commute, but i suffered wearing them more than an hour."
the pods need to be thinner.
they are durable and the included a cable management is nice.
two things good about this is the wire and sound.
"otherwise, i hate when the rubber piece falls out a lot and does not always stay on my ear."
i spent $5 for another brand that stays on and rubber piece much better than this.
will not buy this brand again.
design is exceptional but its a bit hard to keep in your ear.
there's definitely room for improvement.
not a major issue because you can still use it
and it works well.
"this was my second item, the first one started to fall apart by the first week and got return."
"i love the brand i have bought multiple of them, all different styles."
all of them still working to this day or lost them before they started to fall apart or stopped working.
so i'm very disappointed that these didn't last 2 months.

"yes, sound quality is great."
"aside from that, thisparticular model is so uncomfortable for the tragus part of the ear."
i can only use them for 20 minutes at a time.
i am disappointed i spent this much for my ears to ache.
"i had another style of urbanears, and thought i was getting the same ones, but these are a different model and not as comfortable."
i bought urbanears kransen headphones and was totally blown away by them but these sumpans aren't the best.  
"the kransens connect nicely at the back of the earbuds, but these have a hook instead, which means the cord tangles a lot by design!  "
"also, these aren't isolating like the kransens; they are more like apple earbuds, which is ok"
but i loved how isolating the kransens were.  
"these are really just ok; the color is great, the quality is pretty good, but the cool parts of the kransens are missing in the sumpans."
update:
i am not too impressed with these earbuds.  
the covering comes off them pretty easily
and i lost one.  
they aren’t really isolating
and they tangle too much.  
not that much better than iphone earbuds.
do not buy these earphones they will shock you from static electricity.  
urbanears will not refund your money and they do not stand behind the product.
"i like it in concept, but the little ear covers fell off almost immediately."
the supplied in-ear headphone piece/
s designed comes only in one size probably l (large) and always fall even on simple activity like walking.
these are the only headphones i use anymore.
"great sound, awesome colors, and"
they’re very comfortable to wear!
fall apart easily!
don't waste your $$
"headphone connector doesn't seat properly in any device, constant crackling audio that makes them impossible to use."
they contour to my ear much like the apple headphones which i really like.
the rubber covers on the headphones are very comfortable and overall very good sound quality
this was destined to be bad from the get-go.
let's start that this got to me two weeks after the expected delivery date.
"being a user of urbanears headphones, i thought this was an easy decision to make."
wrong!
i use the krandon's which is a different form factor and it should have stayed that way.
since all eares are not made equal there is a good chance that these will not fit your particular ear.
"in my case, they kept falling out."
don't get me wrong
i love the crisp sound that these earphones provide in both phone calls and while playing music
but you ready can't enjoy either with
they keep falling out.
to me these headphones are like the iphone headphones they sound great but are definitely not for me.
i ended up giving them away and incredibly so the person i gave them to loved them because they were a perfect fit.
"it is not so good,but not too bad!"
it is easier to lose some small accessories.
"however,it is not broken,i still use it,i like the color."
"the headphones have great sound but the rubber headphone protectors fall off constantly just from keeping them in your pocket/backpack, things that quality headphones would have no issue with."
stopped working after two months of normal use.
"sound quality is very good, but they aren't very comfortable in your ears and they don't stay in your ears very well at all."
the additional ear buds fell off but i can still enjoy these great head phones...
perfect
the ear grip of the earphones is very bad.
after a while the earphones will start making irritating your earlobes.
very poor design.
not worth the purchase because the earphones are not great and the ear buds keep falling off.
just a waste of money.
i would not purchase it again
fantastic sound quality and overall design and versatility.
perfect for every day life.
sound & fit are both bad.
i don't recommend.
"great headphones, and different from the standard apple buds."
while i'm a big fan of this brand
i was a little disappointed in these.
the rubber inside the ear part always falls off and after using them daily for a few months they're already starting to give off a cracking kind of sound when the bass is too loud.
"received these with our peloton bike, without a doubt the worst ear buds on the market."
"absolute junk, the don't stay positioned in the rear canal while doing any kind of activity."
the also sound like a $2 set of headphones you get at the gas station.
very disappointed in urbanears for trying to pass these off as headphones by having fancy little cord holders and clip together eat buds integrated into them.
they also do not seal l to the ear very well as outside sound tends to bleed in freely.
i can put up with alot of misgivings in headphones but these have crossed the line!
i gave them away after 2 days of use.
never again urbanears!
bought a cheap set of jay birds and never looked back.
i would strongly advise against this headphones.
it’s aesthetically cute but man
it hurts inside your ears.
it does not fit snuggly.
it is not ergonomically aligned with the shape of human ear.
such poor design.
"these things will not stay in my ears, and i rarely have a problem with in-ear headphones staying put."
these don't seem to have been designed to stay in human ears.
"the rubber headphone covers also slide around, blocking sound, or else completely fall off."
"either walking around or sitting down, these make for an infuriating listening experience."
they're cute.
i got the bright yellow/mustard color.
"the cord doesn't tangle easily, and the little hook on the headphone jack is really helpful."
"unfortunately, that's where the pros end."
the size of the ear piece is not interchangable.
"they're rather big, and if i don't insert it at a certain angle, they give me ear pain."
those little silicone 'covers' tend to loosen over time and slip off.
"my earphones only came with two pairs of covers, and now i'm on my last pair."
"if i lose these, well, sucks to be me."
"when buying these, consider carrying around a little pouch to keep your earphones safe."
i think these headphones are great.
good sound.
i especially love the fabric cable and how the earbuds can connect so they don't fall off when i'm not listening to them.
i was listening for five seconds and immediately knew that with this earbuds i have finally found my replacement for my loved sony mdr-21lp's which unfortunately are not produced anymore since a long time.
after ten hours they still sound great.
i'm very happy about that since i was looking for something like this for years.
they fit perfectly in my ears (much better than standard- in ears) and produce a very deep bass boost.
"sound is awesome, full, warm and deep, and i tried many earbuds in this price category."
(i mostly listen to rock and metal).
heigts are a little less pleasant as with the sony mdr-21lps but
"in my opinion, they sound much better than the apple earpods, maybe this is only because they hold much better in my ears."
"these sound crappy, and don't fit tightly in your ears."
ear pieces covered in plastic to prevent touching inner ear skin.
is waterproof which makes for long lasting and a cloth band to prevent getting stretched out of margins.
like it
holy

*!
these are amazing headphones!
"sound, quality, even a stylish convenient carry case!"
these are over the top and for a price i couldn't believe.
thank the heavens and sound gods and all that care so much about precision.
"my ears are happy too because these aren't made with latex material which burn my skin, so now i have a choice between over the ear headphones and these :)))))))))  "
soooo happy
after reading the reviews i was under the impression these earbuds were going to be impressive but to my disappointment they do not live up to what some of these reviewers said.
they sound tinny and don't have any real bass.
sure they come in a fancy package and look like higher quality earbuds
but they aren't.
i'm glad i only paid around $15 for them because they aren't worth anymore then that and i would have felt they should be in the $5 -$8 range (sort of like the kind you give a 10 year old knowing they are going to get trashed).at the same time i ordered these i also ordered the following earbuds earphones in ear headphones earbuds with microphone and volume control for iphone android smartphone
tablet laptop 3.5mm
audio plug devices black that were even less expensive but
"had much, much, much better sound quality than the betron bs10 earbuds."
i can only surmise that most of these reviews for the betron bs10 earbuds are not honest reviews.
i have submitted a picture to show both the earbuds i have referred to in this review as evidence that i have compared them.
"i ordered these because they were advertised to have ""powerfull bass driven sound"" that went to 20hz.  "
i can tell you with 100% certainty that this is not true after testing them with a 20hz test tone.  
they will do 40hz
though although the base is truly subpar.  
"these really aren't any better to me than the $5.00 earbuds you can get at the supermarket but with really nice packaging (magnetic flap on the box, nice little pouch for spare earbuds).to say i'm disappointed is an understatement.  "
they don't meet the advertised specifications at all.  
i would not say these provide powerful bass at all.  
"like most earbuds, they are very crisp on the highs and severely lacking on the low range.  "
waste of money imho.
"perfect fit, recesses flush into the ear."
"natural, deep bass and smooth mid-range with crisp highs."
"sounds like much more expensive phones, excellent quality."
"braided cords, tangle resistant."
"bought two, gave one to my son who loves them too, then i just ordered another for a spare for myself."
very happy with this purchase.
great sound quality.
the only problem with them is my husband misplaces them.
earphones need to have a tracker.
great sounding headphones for the money!  
"i've owned many brands, including shure, rha, ultimate ears and bowers & wilkens.  "
these bs10s can compete with any of those.  
the highs are silky smooth and the low end is well controlled with a taut and detailed bass.
"the sound is surprisingly neutral, and the sound stage is decent as well, especially when used with my fiio e17!  "
a real bargain for the money!
"i was a little skeptical of the many glowing reviews of these earphones, and indeed found them to be a mixed bag in terms of quality.  "
"the overall sound is clear and full, but mid-range notes tend to be sharp and brassy.  "
"the bass is certainly better than most earphones in this price range, but by no means booming.  "
"the earphones do stay in your ear with this unusual and stylish design, but the design is not especially comfortable for extended wear.  "
"build quality, particularly the cords, appears above average.  "
the packaging is nicely presented but frankly unnecessary for a lower-end product like this.  
"if like me you are the type who loses a lot of earphones, these are a decent option given the relatively low price, you won't feel that bad losing them.  "
"just don't expect the same sound quality as in much more expensive headphones, and you will be happy with these."
excellent headphones.
would totally recommend.
i ended up buying a 2nd pair a few weeks later.
"i thought they looked great when i bought them, but the funny thing is, they grew on me."
i think these look fantastic now.
good sound and pretty durable.
bought a random $20 pair of headphones and these sound way better.
i'm comparing this earphones to panasonic  rp-hje120-k which you can buy for $8.99 on amazon....
"first impression - box is solid, very good packing, great looking bag and overall really great first impression, however they do feel cheap and fragile..."
but when i decided to test it with my fav songs.... it was awful...
"no bass at all compared to panasonic,"
"yes, maybe sound quality is better but it is not even close to what panasonic has.."
"i used my panasonic for 4 years and always enjoyed music, especially bass, decided to try something ""better"" , more expensive turned out to be worse...."
i should've just keep my panasonics...
"the packaging is really nice, it has a magnetic clip."
it also comes with a pouch to store the headphones and the spare rubber earpads.
the build is really and they feel high quality.
"they don't have a deep bass, but they sound great with rock music (arcade fire, david bowie,etc)."
i will get another pair in case i lose them!
"i would like to write something that appears unrelated, but it is not."
it will help you take a decision; or so i hope.
"in bygone times in my younger years, i was in europe conducting a philharmonic orchestra."
"today, i listen to the music of my guys like tchaikovsky, mozart, bach, vivaldi, beethoven, chopin, and several others."
they all allow me to vividly remember those good times that i experienced in the upper-crust and glitter of the wonderful world of classical music.
"some time ago, i was given the opportunity to listen to their music through $185.00 headphones."
wow!
"i could distinctively hear every instrument, and even chopin whispering..."
"""bonjour georges."
""" i cannot afford headphones that likely cost double that price nowadays."
"so, i settled for the betron bs10 earphones."
"to my immense and gratifying surprise, technology has advanced to the point that my guys and their music are there again."
"even mozart whispered at my ears... """
well comeback!
""" i do not want to tell you that the betron bs10 earphones compare to the headphones i once tried, but considering the price, the sound the breton delivers satisfies my understanding of a philharmonic orchestra playing music meant for those with more elaborated minds."
i doubt that you will regret giving betron bs10 earphones a chance.
great value.
reasonably priced and has pretty good bass for the price although my type of music is not bass heavy.
"one thing though, the ear buds might not be for everyone."
i love them but my wife could not stand them.
i was shocked at the quality of the construction and even the quality of packaging on these headphones for the price they are.
they are comfortable and work well so far.
i really like the material the cord is made with
", it's sturdy and doesn't tangle as easily as other headphones i have."
"these headphones are quite shocking, but not in the good way."
i've read the reviews and they all seem pretty good.
"shortly after ordering these, around two months after, the left headphone has started giving shock torture to my left"
"ear, as in actual electric shocks that are quite painful."
"it happens every time i move my head, body, anything, it shocks me."
"if i wanted shock torture, i'd commit a crime."
"it's a shame too, because almost everything about these bad boys are top notch for how cheap they are."
these headphones have better sound quality than a $60 pair of headphones i had before getting these.
too bad i have to deal with pain whenever i wear these.
i'll have to switch back to another pair or find something that won't give me a shock (not in the good way)
every time i wear these.
there's no sign of damage either.
it looks perfectly fine.
maybe i'm the problem here?
your run of the mill cheap earbuds usually handle highs and mid-range decent enough.
pricing usually goes up based on how they handle bass.
with that in mind most cheap earbuds just plain old cut bass out.
the maker of these opted to leave some resemblance of bass
so when you shove them tight enough into your ear canal it acts as insulator amplifying the “bass” sound.
it’s a cheap work around that ultimately muddies the earbuds overall sound quality.
as for the people who don’t want to do this for various reasons but
"for my example let’s say to allow some background noise in to hear others around you, you get distortion across the board when any hint of bass occurs.  "
they seem put together well enough but don’t get your hopes up
that
"you’ve found some hidden gem for $10, what you’re getting is a poorly executed cheap pair of earbuds in a fancy package."
people saying they get full sound either don't know what they are listening to or received a different product than i. the addd bass in these units come at the price of muddy and muted mids and highs.
this makes these pretty rough for podcasts and talking video.
you end up needing increased volume to compensate which then overextends the bass.
i compared a number of other buds and headphones i had
and these stood out with this muddled sound.
aside from that negative the build quality here appears top notch.
"the wire is coated in a nice rubber material, the buds are metal, and the plug is metal."
"i'm guessing the durability is great as well, though i won't find out since i'm going back to a clearer ear bud."
i'll probably hand these off to a friend or relative.
"if all you do is listen to music, particularly pop/electronic/rap then these are great."
"if you listen to voice sensitive audio, keep looking."
"i like the ergonomic design a lot, these feel like they won't ever fall out of my ears."
i'm not an audio elitist
so all i can tell you is that they sound just fine.
my only real complaint is that the cord is rubbery and tends to be more difficult to work with sometimes than standard thinner cords.
"oh, and it has a sleeve to put the two cords together, which is huge for me because i can only listen to one at a time when at work."
i'm considering buying a second pair if i can get the same price.
these are garbage headphones.
not built to last.
mine malfunctioned within a couple months.
they claim to offer a one year warranty which i tried to sign up for the day the headphones arrived.
"however, when i tried to apply for the warranty on their website, i was redirected to a page where they ask you to sign up for a mailing list to receive special offers."
"once the headphones malfunctioned i emailed the merchants a few times to ask them to honor the warranty, and they stopped responding to me."
they are scam artists.
do not purchase this product.
"it does not last, there is no warranty, and the merchants are scam artists who will stop responding to you."
will never do business with these scam artists again
great headphones and great quality.
the metal on the 1/8th-inch connection and the ear buds is a great touch.
it makes them feel more durable.
the sound is full and they isolate well with the addition of the larger silicone ear bud.
the ergonomic design is awesome because you can lay down on your side and still listen comfortably.
i will buy from them again.
i was excited for these but unfortunately was disappointed.
i use my earbuds every day and even while i sleep.
i wake up super easy at the smallest noise
so i tried noise isolating earbuds that came with my galaxy note 8 to watch videos as i sleep
and it works great
but these aren't noise isolating at all
and they're super uncomfortable in my ears.
the sound quality was fine but the con's out weight the pros.
maybe i got a defective unit so this review is just for that.
i ordered these as an upgrade from my cheapo ergofit panasonics that were destroyed after months of very heavy use.
i first assumed maybe it was my ear playing tricks and tried repositioning the left ear bud for optimal sound
but that didn't solve my issue.  
i bought a dollar store pair for comparison and those were more balanced than these.
i had other people test them and the same appeared to be true.
the left bud produced a lower volume and less clear image than the right ear bud.
i really wanted to like these ear buds as they feel very nice and fit my ears perfectly
but i can't get over how ridiculously unbalanced they are.  
maybe i received a dud.... ????
"in february of this year, i ordered two different in-ear earbud earphones to replace my iluv earbuds, purchased in 2014 from amazon, but which were beginning to fray at the plug end of the cable."
the model i purchased then was no longer available and the other iluv models got mixed reviews.
i have already reviewed the jayfi jeb-101 earbuds that did no meet my preferences.
the betron bs10 earbuds that i'll review here did.
"first, my preferences: i like a heavy bass line when i listen to music (oldies, rock, r&b, etc.)."
"my favorite earphones, for extended listening, are the sony mdr-xb400 on-ear earphones, also discontinued but still available."
"when paired with my sony walkman nwz-e385 model, they are great."
the 30mm drivers deliver a 5hz low end
really pounds out the bass.
"the 22mhz top end is above my hearing range, so that doesn't matter as much to me."
"my favorite ""test"" song:"
"jaylo's ""if you had my love"" with the heavy bass line that kicks in at about the 18 second mark of the long instrumental lead-in."
in summary: the 12mm drivers of the betron bs10 earbuds do a great job and were a perfect replacement for the unavailable iluv model i've enjoyed for nearly 5 years.
the jayfi jeb-101 were not.
"as a bonus, the betron model was very inexpensive and i found that the angled earbuds were very comfortable as well."
they earned a 5-star rating from me as they fit my listening preferences perfectly.
my standard audio disclaimer: everyone's audio preferences are different.
the betron bs10 match my personal preferences perfectly.
"""you mileage may differ."""

"first, my preferences: i like a heavy bass line when i listen to music (oldies, rock, r&b, etc.)."
"my favorite earphones, for extended listening, are the sony mdr-xb400 on-ear earphones, also discontinued but still available."
"when paired with my sony walkman nwz-e385 model, they are great."
the 30mm drivers deliver a 5hz low end
really pounds out the bass.
"the 22mhz top end is above my hearing range, so that doesn't matter as much to me."
"my favorite ""test"" song:"
"jaylo's ""if you had my love"" with the heavy bass line that kicks in at about the 18 second mark of the long instrumental lead-in."
in summary: the 12mm drivers of the betron bs10 earbuds do a great job and were a perfect replacement for the unavailable iluv model i've enjoyed for nearly 5 years.
the jayfi jeb-101 were not.
"as a bonus, the betron model was very inexpensive and i found that the angled earbuds were very comfortable as well."
they earned a 5-star rating from me as they fit my listening preferences perfectly.
my standard audio disclaimer: everyone's audio preferences are different.
the betron bs10 match my personal preferences perfectly.
"""you mileage may differ."""
initial impression: these earbuds (really really really) surprised me.
"i only bought them as a backup pair, but i ended up using them exclusively."
"i have used earbuds ranging from $15 to $70, but these were actually the cheapest i've bought at around $11."
i am not exaggerating when i say that these sound as good as the $70 pair of sennheisers that i used to use.
sound:
"crystal clear top, mid, and low end."
"perfect bass without artificially ""boosted"" sound."
"i've never heard better sound quality from in ear headphones, but my over the ear sennheisers are better."
though they cost me $160.
"on top of that, these earbuds have enough volume that i don't always have to turn the volume to max, which i normally do with other headphones."
quality:
"still in the early days of owning these, so pretty much all i have to go on is feel and materials used."
"these things are way more sturdy feeling than sony, skullcandy, sennheiser, etc."
earbuds.
they even have metal bands at the plug and the fork
(i have no idea the proper terms for those parts
lol).
"also, they don't have flat cords, but they tangle hardly at all somehow."
they actually tangle less than some flat corded earbuds i've owned.
features:
"these earbuds do not have a mic or any buttons, which is actually what i wanted, but others looking for more features may be disappointed."
there were multiple silicon tips and a pair of foam tips included.
fit: really my only knock on these is that they make my ears sore with extended wear.
the drivers on these are quite big and the way that they fit in my ears puts pressure that gets uncomfortable after 4 or 5 hours of listening to music while doing homework.
"ears are pretty unique, so these may be totally comfortable for you or even less comfortable for you."
"otherwise, the fit of these is more flush than any i've worn."
"they do not stick out of your ears like most earbuds, which may be useful if you are trying to be aerodynamic or something loloverall: nearly perfect earbuds for about $11."
you honestly do not deserve this good of earbuds for $11.
you cannot go wrong buying these.
i would pay $50 for my next pair of these if they raised the price.
"amazing build quality, like others have mentioned you cant get more valhe for the money from any other earphones."
"sound is very clear, good bass (not overwhelming), not sure about noise cancelling"
but they are really loud.
"if you just need a pair of good earphones to listen to music, go for it"
you wont regret it.
this one blow most $50 earphones out of the water.
these hearphones are the best one i've ever purchase...
sound quality is great lovely base and clean sound.
it has great construction - metallic 'jack plug' and earbuds part also...
and the wires are coated in though rubber.
so i believe these earphones is durable...
it was built to last.
it fits and feels comfortable in my ears.
so 5 stars all the way....
no complaints...!!!
very disappointed with these earphones.  
i bought them for the specific purpose of using with an am pocket radio as i mow my 7 acres.  
"i wanted earphones that would stay in my ears and block some of the noise from my tractor, and these met that requirement.  "
"however, the earphones and cables also double as an antenna, and these earphones failed miserably.  "
"i could tell after taking only a half dozen steps, that the am reception, from a very strong, local station, was very poor and varied with each step.  "
"i've used $2.00 earbuds that performed much better, but would not stay in my ears, over bumpy terrain, nor block ambient noise.  "
these are probably adequate for use with ipods or other electronics not requiring reception of radio signals!!
i bought these earbuds following some recommendations online that these were some of the best-sounding cheap earbuds around.
"after comparing some flac files using these and the apple earpods with the same dac, the difference is clear."
"the apple earpods sound much more natural and detailed, while these earbuds sound tinny, lacking in definition, and a little bit like listening to music through a tube."
bass is muddy.
they're alright earbuds if you're not an audiophile and don't care much about sound quality.
they've got nice build quality and a low price.
"however, i would recommend you take reviews boasting about the sound quality of these earbuds with a grain of salt."
"they're pretty much like what you should expect a $13 pair of earbuds to sound like, if half the money had gone to packaging quality."
"pros; good design, fits well in ear, comes with lots accessories."
cons; the sound is very tinny/hollow.
i purchased these because they were supposed to have good bass and the bass is less in quality than my $6
buy one get one free skullcandys headphones which i wish i could get more of but have since been discontinued..
are they worth $13?
sure why not why!
is it worth the hassle to return them ?  
probably not!
"would i buy them again, no, probably not.."
i don't know who is writing all the positive reviews claiming these have bass...
but nothing could be further from the truth.
these are a huge disappointment!
every pair of ear buds i've ever gotten for free have more bass than these.
"they fit awkwardly in the ear at best, and are clumsy to handle."
sure glad i didn't pay more for them.
they aren't even worth what they cost.
do not believe the reviews about these sounding good - they do not.
absolutely no bass at all.
huge disappointment.
i got these back on april 9th and on july 15th the sound stopped coming through the left earbud.
i have been walking around for two days trying to strategically maneuver the cord in a way that the sound will come back and it's maddening.
now i need new headphones.
these lasted three months.
"if you don't care that they won't necessarily last long, they're fine as a throw-away pair of earbuds, but even at the price point they should last longer than that."
i'm going to have to go back to an old brand or try something else new.
"i had high hopes for these with the reviews, but they didn't wow me."
"the sound quality is definitely better than some other i've used, but the bass was still lacking."
"they do stay in your ears well, but the material the cord is made of sort of gets stuck to things"
and i found that to be annoying.
"purchase at your own discretion, but i will be continuing down the road on the quest for great earbuds."
the sound quality of these was awful.
"it's like they focused solely on the bass, as the mid-range & treble are muddy & muffled."
"even the bass notes weren't clean & clear, just forceful & ham-handed."
"i tried several different types of music, even my nintendo 2ds, & the awful quality was immediately evident."
"i liked the multiple sets of earbuds included, but the sound quality compared to even the cheapest earbuds out there made it a very easy choice to get rid of these."
"the wire is kind of braided, which struck me as more durable & less tangle-prone, but it also has kind of a gross texture & plasticy smell to it."
"yes, the packaging is pretty, but who cares when the headphones sound like this?one thing i didn't think to check before i bought--it's very hard to tell which side is left & right."
"there's a tiny letter l and r on each that's the same color as the rest of the material (black), so you really have to look for it & have good light."
"as i intended to use these often on public transit & flights, & i care about sounds on the left channel coming into my left ear & right channel into my right ear"
", that would've gotten to be a pain very quickly."
"fortunately, i won't be keeping them long enough to suffer through that."
"like: low price, solid sound quality,durable cable & input jack (it's fallen to the ground [with my phone]"
"a few times and survived the family cat long enough for me to pry it out of his paws),dislike: cable texture & how it sticks to itself and similar materials, drivers are slightly to big for my ears making them not great for joggingit's been 3 months since i got them (which is way longer than i was expecting them to last given their price) and the only notable damage in that time is that the glue keeping the mesh on the left headphone wore out and caused it to start making a poping noise sometimes."
this stopped when i removed the mesh.
for 4-8 hours of use every day (44 hours a week average or 6.28 hours a day average) for 3 months and under $20 i've had headphones last as short as a single day
so i'd say for $12.99 i can't think of any other headphones that i've had that have lasted this long.
"i recently had to replace my ear-bud headphones for my kindle, and i didn't want to break the bank, so i looked around on amazon and found these.  "
i was initially drawn to them due to the large magnets.  
"in all speaker/audio equipment, it is large magnets that make the sound fidelity because it improves response.  "
"they cost less than alternatives, so i thought i'd buy one to see how good it was."
"i got the package, and thought they went overboard on quality packaging until i tried them.  "
the packaging is an indicator of just how high a quality these are-  
"in fact, they are the best ear-bud headphones i have ever had.  "
they do not have intrinsic volume control or mic-
but that's ok.  
"they almost completely eliminate outside noise, and the performance is everything i would wish it to be-"
sound response is incredible.  
"no distortion, solid base, and good high notes."
"now, having said that, i must also mention comfort"
/fit-  
"these are the first ear-buds i've ever had that slid in, right out of the box as if they were designed for my ears.  "
amazing!  
"they don't need to be pushed in until it hurts, they do not fall out or 'walk out' of the ear canal.  "
they are so comfortable that i can forget they are in.  
"furthermore, the cabling is a higher quality and resists 'memory' if you coil it.  "
"seems more durable, too."
inside the box they have several ear-canal adapters for you to get the perfect fit.  
the ones already on (out of the box) worked fine for me.
these are great earbuds.  
i am really impressed with the sound quality at both low and higher volumes.  
the sound is warm and balanced.  
"bass is not mushy, highs are not brittle.  "
i can't imagine there is anything better at this price point.  
i think they are easily worth twice what i paid.  
when looking at them online
i was concerned about the shape
but they fit in my ear very comfortably.  
i fall asleep at night with these in and they are comfortable.update
5/6/19
- i've been using these every night for the past 6 weeks.  
i usually wake up in the middle of the night and find them tangled up around my arm or wherever.  
they get yanked on pretty hard
but they are still working perfectly.  
other ear buds i've owned have failed after just a little rough treatment.  
loving these buds more every day.
first purchase of these headphones did not last long and i was very careful with them.
i contacted the seller and they were gracious enough to replace.
the second pair has only lasted 8 months and finally gave out in the left ear.
"the sound quality is great, they do not tangle, the packaging was great, price point is good."
"i will try to repair the earbud myself in the left ear but, this will be my last purchase of this item."
i had a pair of cheaper headphones at $3 that lasted me 2 years but the company sold out.
i am still hopeful to find the perfect pair.
sound is good but the cord is so flimsy.
it cuts off the music at the slightest tap and also i have to keep adjusting the cord for music to play.
it triggers voice stuff even though theres no microphone
so i disabled those things.
this would be great if it didnt stop the music as soon as i put in my pocket.
i even held it in my hand.
wiggled the cord gently and it interrupts the music.
major waste of money for me.
maybe i got a defective set.
i wont be buying again.
so much for amazon choice.
"not bad for $10, you get what you pay for."
due to the design/shape of these they don't create a tight fit in my ear.
"i tried all 3 sizes of rubber tips, even the foam tip, and still not a very good fit."
"you could still hear others in the gym very clearly, whereas you'd  think you could just jam um in a bit more"
"but nope, not these things."
"also, the cord could be a couple inches longer."
"the whole ""super bass"" is a gimmick if you ask me."
"due to the lack of solid seal between ear and earbud, theres no way."
i still give it 3 stars
though- because of the price point
my wife accuses me of buying earbuds like imelda marcos buys shoes.
sometimes i lose them; more often than not my dog eats them.  
"to date, philips has been my brand of choice -- good value, good sound.  "
"but, when my dog ate the last pair, i ordered maxrock sleep earplugs and for a host of reasons (mostly sound quality)"
had to return them.  
what to do?  
"i read some reviews and decided on the betron bs100 earbuds, which were on sale"
"(thank you, amazon!), and could not believe the sound!  "
seriously.  
i listen to everything from gregorian chant to high-fidelity film scores (think hanz zimmer) at night.  
it's that last bit of entertainment i afford myself before i close out the day.  
"i was blown away with how well these fit (just twist them a little once they're in your ear to get the right fit), put the sleep timer on pandora, and voila!  "
they don't dig into your ear when you're laying on a pillow.  
"i use them during he day on the treadmill, too.  "
"highly recommend karl jenkins, too, if you're into powerful, choral, symphonic music.  "
ahhhh.
i am on a constant search for that holy grail of good earbuds/earphones.
i prefer buds to pods as the pods constantly fall from my ears (i've tried several types -- even wireless-- and none of them would stay in my ears for an appreciable amount of time).  
"and because i'm a petite fleur, the in ear buds eventually make my ears itchy and hurt when i'm wearing them in bed.  "
"earbuds are essential to me, as i have the loudest, snoringest husband ever, and must wear buds to listen to podcasts or music at night in bed  "
(earplugs just don't cut it).  
these earphones are awesome!  
"the design is a combo of buds and pods; the buds go into your ear but not too far down your canal, thus cutting down on the itchiness of having rubber/latex too deep in your ear, and the pod feature sits the ""cup"" of your ear and supports the bud, so nothing falls out.  "
i have had no problems with them falling out while supine or walking around.  
"it's hard to explain without a vocabulary fluent in ent anatomy, but if you take a look at the pic you should be able to figure out what i mean."
"the sound ain't beats (but neither is the price!), but the consistent stereo sound is quite good for the price."
folks: i've purchased tons of earbuds in my life time.  
"i've always stayed away from brands with ""tronic"" ""sonic"" you know: those off brands: that claim some of everything.  "
honestly: i hesitated before purchasing these buds: because of their lack of popular name recognition.  
i connected them to my mp3 player:
and i was hooked!  
clear highs: reach out and touch your ear drums mids:
and hey fella: somebodys knocking on the front door: because your bass is disturbing the neighbors!  
i can't speak on durability: but they are well made: and very nice buds.  
the price can't be beat: for the sound quality of these buds either!  
i'd giv 'em 10
"stars!well: i was reading some of the 1 and 2 star reviews concerning these earbuds sounding ""tinny."
"""  "
when it comes to earbuds: you have to get that complete ear to silicon seel in order to get that full:
bass sound from any pair of buds.  
the foam tips that come with these buds aren't going to give you that type of seel.  
i removed my large silicon tips from an older pair of buds: and that was the perfect fit!  
"try ""large silicon tips"" and try them again."
alright...
so far i'm pretty dang impressed with these!
the quality/price ratio is outstanding.
"i really wasn't expecting much from a $12 pair of headphones but these are comparable even to my expensive, in-ear bass-y sony earbuds!"
and the sony ones cost a lot
more!the quality of sound is that of much larger headphones.
i have no idea how companies manage to pack this kind of quality into tiny earbuds...
i'm a bit older now
"i guess and it used to be that if you wanted quality sound, you had to pay a lot of money and the headphones were massive...."
that seems to be a thing of the past
and i couldn't be happier about that
:) i never liked those gigantic headphones -_-aelec...
well done...
you have my business
and i'll be recommending these to friends!
i have several wireless earbuds and have decided to stay away from that product.
"reason being, i don't know when i will actually use them"
"and when i do, the power has gone down during non-usage."
i am now back to wired.
1)
hard wired direct connection to the player  2)
"no need for batteries/charging 3) direct connection, at least tome, means much better sound.  "
as for the betron bs10.
these earbuds deliver amazing bass.
other instruments are crisp and voices are distinct.
but the bass is what really delivers.
the carrying pouch is very convenient and the included
ear gels provide just the right sizes for most ears.
they are comfortable and are a great fit.
these were better than i expected and worth far more than what i paid for them.
"great product, fast shipping and good packaging."
recommended.
"for comparison, i ordered these to replace a pair of akg's that came with samsung galaxy."
i've loved and used those religiously for about 3 yrs now which were still in perfect condition until my wonderful kitty found them and decided they were a fun chew toy.
"out of the box, these are gorgeous earbuds."
i love the design and quality of materials.
they have an actual metal piece at the connection point and the earbuds themselves fit very nicely and seem very secure.
the wires are covered with soft a plastic which seems like it should hold up fairly well with time and wear.
"also, they come with a nice little carrying pouch to protect and keep them from tangling."
love it!
now the not so good...
these do not have a volume/play control on the wire which i'll take blame for not actually reading the description on that one
but that was a slightly disappointing realization.
on to sound quality.
i plugged these into my phone which i always use for music
and i instantly noticed how tiny the sound really is.
"the bass is light, background music fairly loud, but the vocals are just very quiet and overpowered by the music."
i'm not incredibly picky given these are fairly cheap earbuds
and otherwise i love them
and they're incredibly comfortable so will definitely keep them
but someone who is keen on sound quality may want to move on to a more expense item as these probably wont satisfy your ears.
"very, very happy with the bs10,"
"well deserving of ""amazon choice"" and so many 5-star ratings.  "
"the claim of a rich base tone is absolutely true; however, the degree of the base richness depends upon where the audio originates (garbage in = garbage out thing).  "
"pandora broadcasts the base beautifully and full, but not overpowering."
video originating from lesser quality origins does not allow the full base potential =
no brainer
", right?"
trebble is fine.
i was going to order another type of earbud with a tangle-free cord but
"the single cord on the bs10 is thick and wrapped with a cleat plastic, thus making it almost tangle-free but not hindered to allow a neat wrap if desired."
the earbuds have about a 20-degree bend to allow a firm and better fit into the ear canal.
the bud speaker has a small footprint
so it does not extend out of the ear or pressure the ear and cause discomfort.
the 3.5mm jack has a very nice metal grip surface to prevent stress on the cord.
nice little case and spare tips included.
it is just a great product
and i would buy it again and recommend it without reservation.
i investigated the reviews
and i couldn't resist trying these.
"i use ear buds alot riding my motorcycles, i've had a difficult time find some that fit and sound good."
well these are it!!!
the bass and sound of these is simply amazing.
"for the price you really can't ask for more, but you get alot more."
like any earbud getting the helmet on/off is difficult.
"once you do get it right, you likely won't have pressure points."
they only fit better due to the way they are designed.
"translating for your benefit less road noise, volume, and battery used.  "
you can spend 20$ and usually get junk at walmart.
you can not beat this deal.
i would not recommend these headphones for working out because they do not stay in the ear firmly.  
i do recommend them for use in the office or anywhere where one will not be all active.  
"i love the sleek look, strong cord and the packaging"
is shows the manufacturers made an effort to give a quality product to the customer.  
i am not an expert with sound
but i know good clear crisp sound when i hear it.  
"bass is important to me and this has the right amount good enough to listen smooth jazz, but not the kicking bass that is required for reggae.  "
i have scored it five for sound quality for the cost of it.  
i get a sense that with good care i will have this earbud for a few years...
"first off excellent quality sound, period."
for the $$ excellent buy.
why2 stars?
"i had the buds for about 8 days, and the output jack became ""wonky""...started loosing sound in one bud,"
then the other and finally broke as i was removing them from my laptop.
there is a warranty
", i am looking into it, will report on how that comes out."
i bought another set of betron's
", this time with the l shaped output jack, hoping this will not be hit by dogs,as the truth is me damn english mastiff slapped the jack, and from then on it was troubles."
bottom line?
"sound as reported, not mastiff proof."
i have been using these headphones daily for a couple weeks.  
"i use them for around 10 hours per day, 5 days a week at work.  "
i am very impressed with these headphones.  
"they have good treble, impressive bass and a fairly full sound.  "
they have a very elegant sleek look.  
the cord is about the perfect length to put my mp3 player into my jeans pocket.  
"they fit my ears perfect and do not fall out, even if i turn my head to the side and shake it.  "
i also really like the provided clip
so i can clip the cord to my shirt to
it's not pulling down on my ears.  
i have also gone to sleep with them in listening to music.  
they fit flush enough to my head that they don't press on my inner ear.  
all in all i really like these.  
which is why i've already purchases a few more pairs.  
always nice to have extra headphones laying around...
these headphones feel higher quality than most earbuds i've ever had.
the metal of the actual bud is heavy and does not feel cheap.
"the wires feel more ""heavy duty"""
then any bud
i've seen.
"the deal breaker, to me, is the sound."
"i don't know is this is the sound that most people like nowadays, but i found these buds lacking in the mids and highs."
no i'm not a audiophile...
i've never paid more than 125 for a pair of headphones.
"i just like a ""flatter"" sound in my headphones."
"yes i like some bass, but i don't want it at the expense of crystal clear highs."
i had been using the s7 oem samsung earbuds.  
i have reordered these many times and sometimes tried other brands.
"but no matter what reviewers say, all buds sound pretty much the same.  "
i haven't had these bs10s long enough to grade quality/durability but the build quality looks good and sturdy.  
the sound is amazing!  
"they are not a replacement for my audio technica atm-50s, but they are by far the best sounding earbuds i have ever heard!"
the ergonomics of the bud is great and sits in-ear comfortably.  
i will be buying these as replacements from now on.
the title says it all.
my ears were sore as hell after a couple days use with these earbuds.
"i find my ears to be pretty average-size, but these really made my ears sore after extended use with the larger driver piece rubbing against the inside of my ear the whole time."
"overall sound quality was good, if a little bass-driven and louder than might be appreciated."
"if you can get them for cheap, then there's no point in not trying them, but let me just give you a heads up to make sure you've selected the proper with/without mic option before you purchase."
"i selected the one, and ended up with the other being shipped somehow, but i'm not going to take points off for that since it was probably user (my) error."
i bought these for my pre-teen.  
he loves them.  
fit in his ears and mine very well.
"if you're looking for sound isolation, remember you pay for what you get -"
these rely on the fit of the earbud into your ear canal.  
"no magic there - if it fits snugly, it'll block a good portion of exterior sound.  "
"if the buds don't fit well, then you're not going to get much sound isolation.  "
"maybe try comply tips, i haven't tried with these yet."
i think the sound is very good for a $15 set of earphones.  
"don't expect too much, they aren't high-end audiophile equipment..."
but they are very good.  
i'll buy again.
the fit of the earphones were strange.
"even after trying all of the ear pieces, the earphones still very loosely fit into my ear."
they would occasionally fall out during use.
i was okay with this up until today when it started shocking my ears.
"during normal use, they suddenly sent a shock to my ears"
and i had to yank them out.
"after trying to use them on another source, i had the same issue after a few seconds."
they worked fine for the two weeks prior
but i did not expect them to have issues so soon.
i'd be okay if they just stopped playing sound
but these earphones actually lightly electrocuted me.
i purchased these earphones as a quick fix when i misplaced my original samsung earphones by akg.
"i did a search for those and these particular earphones came up, so i bought them."
"if you're looking for the quality of those original samsung earbuds, you won't find them in these 12.99 earbuds."
"but, these earphones are decent."
"other reviews complain about the bass, or lack thereof - and they're right"
", it's not as good as maybe they were expecting, but the bass it"
okay.
what are you expecting when you're paying under $20 for these?
"that said, the build and quality of the components are better than i was expecting."
"the material doesn't feel cheap, and it comes with a nifty carrying case that also includes replacement ear bud covers."
pleasantly surprised.
a really great deal for pretty good earphones!
i wanted some decent earphones for work but with good bass because there's nothing worse than listening to some hip hop and have it sounding flat.  
"at first i was disappointed because i plugged them into my computer monitor and played something, and it still sounded awful and flat, just like my old pair.  "
"then, i plugged them into my phone and the bass was amazing!  "
"the sound is smooth, and there's plenty of bass for me.  "
"only drawback is that i really wanted to use them with my work computer, but it must be an issue with how sound is delivered through the monitors, and not the earphones since they work great with my phone.  "
"when i wear these out, i'll definitely buy another pair.  "
great value!
the sound quality is good.
"i have seen others complain about the base, but i found the base was good."
what i really can't take is how much pain i'm in while trying to use these buds.
"i was previously using the cheapy panasonic buds you can find on amazon, but the quality control made me go in search of a new pair."
"i was hoping this would be the answer, but the fact that i'm in physical pain while using the smallest bud covers is totally unacceptable."
"very disappointing, because, while the quality of the panasonics was not great, i could wear them for hours without any issues."
the search goes on....
"i was tired if the canny sound of the old pair of in-ear headphones i was using with my roku (plugged into remote), i needed something more bass heavy."
decided to give these a try before spending money on name-brand ones.
wow!
these sound amazing!
"been listening to bolt thrower, thee o sees, the smiths, carousel, and the mahavishnu orchestra."
they all sound amazing on these!
the sound on my wireless sony wh-1000xm2s is more defined and balanced but because of the heavy bass on these buds it absolutely sounds like you're at a live concert.
of these bands!
that would be some ticket!
can't believe they're only $11!
"even the packaging is beautiful, and it comes with replacement eartips in a wide range of sizes, an optional little clamp to clip the wire to your clothes, and a neat little storage pouch (like a wallet i had as a kid, brilliant)."
what a steal!
"yeah, they have lots of base, but the mids/highs are lacking so much that i had to throw them away."
betron needs to spend less money on packaging/branding and more or r and d to get these things to sound right
"these headphones sound exceptionally good for all sorts of music, the bass is not overemphesized like you would think."
i use them with my lg v30 that is equipped with a hifi dac and they sound stunning.
"i don't listen to bass heavy musin but bands that mostly rely on mid and high spectrum such as rush,"
"yes, manfred mann's earth band, pink floyd etc."
i have had hard time putting them down once i start listening as the sound is nothing short of magic.
"the bass does not muddle miss and highs, vocals are very good."
the only complaint i have is that they get uncomfortable inside my ears after a while due to a rectangular nature of the part going inside your ear
i think.
built quality seems to be sturdy and reinforcement points seem to be made to last (metal made).
i would recommend if you are short on cash but still want a better quality sound for next to nothing.
you can do a lot worst then these.
these are so uncomfortable.
the earbuds are metal and the ear piece is on the side of the metal circle.
that means you have the edge of the metal circle jamming in your ear cartilage the whole time you have these in.
because of the weird fit they also have trouble staying in your ears.
"just a really weird design, why is the ear piece on the side of the circle like that?edit"
: 2 months later and they're already broken!!!
"these earbuds sound ok for the price, not a lot of bass, but the mids and highs come through crystal clear."
"they're very comfortable to wear because of the design, and the cord doesn't tangle like most earbuds."
maybe after a break in period they will sound better.
"as far as noise isolation, they might block 50%-60% of ambient/outside noise, but at this price point, you're not getting the best, nor the worst, you get what you pay for, and these are priced accordingly."
all in all a nice set of earbuds at a fair price with decent sound.
"i was looking to replace an old pair of skull candy earbuds, that have a very nice sound, but were never as robust as i would like."
"i looked at many reviews, both on amazon, as well as many other independent sites."
", and initially ordered symphonized that were well reviewed and said they had good base."
"sadly, although very nice sound otherwise, they completely lacked any base at all, and actually sounded identical to my old skull candy."
"so, after returning those, i circled back to these betron bs10 earbuds, and on initial listening, am quite pleased."
"they have a beautifully balanced sound, and for the price, a decently worthy base as well."
"i use earbuds like these mostly on long plane rides, and are looking forward to trying these out in a couple weeks."
i will check back with any more feedback.
this is a mixed review.
the sound on these earbuds is very good.
the quality of the materials is very good.
the only down side after using these for over a month is the cords.
the thick rubber coating makes them bounce around like a pinball while exercising .  
"on more than one occasion while on my elliptical and really working it, the cord bounced and jumped with my movement, until it caught on either my hand or the machine and rippped the buds out of my ears."
"also, all the bounce in the cords will transfer noise to the buds as well."
on a plus they never tangle but the cords are just out of control.
"i'm not sure what some of the negative reviews are talking about, but these headphones deliver!"
"if anything, there is a sliver of too much bass, but it definitely doesn't ruin the sound for me."
i enjoy a nice full sound when i listen to my music and the bass helps in that.
"for the price, these are great headphones."
*
*revised 1-03-19--these earbuds have a very balance sound.  
"from about 45hz to 10hz, it has the neutral flat sound.  "
you can hear the highs and low end.  
"these won't blow your ear with bass, but you can hear the low end."
"compared to the akg earbuds that come with galayx s8's, these have a lower end bass extension.  "
but the akgs have a higher end frequency response.
for $13 its more than worth it.
only mistake i made was....
"the pics for these show a plug for a set with mic, but these don't have  mic."
"so i can't review the quality of these, because i never even got the chance to use them."
hence the 3's across the board.
i have small ears.
the default paddings for these was too big for me.
"not a big deal, they added replacements."
"after fighting with getting the defaults off the buds (having to resort to using pliers to get one off, and tearing it in the process), i looked through the options provided."
the even bigger ones were obviously not going to work for mine.
"they had some really long, solid-foam ones that looked appealing, because i noticed these ones don't go in very far, and i prefer snug fits in the ear canal."
so i decided to try them.
that's when i first realized the problem.
"the designers of these earbuds, in their infinite wisdom, decided to make the stubs that the padding goes around really wide ovals (with the same thickness as normal round stubs)."
and then shipped padding that conforms to the standard round stubs.
"after fighting with the long foam ones, and tearing one nearly in half in the process, i gave up and went for the rubber ones."
surely they'd fit better.
boy was i mistaken.
i was already skeptical once i saw that the stub was literally larger than the only smaller bud provided.
"but after managing to tear that one trying to get it on, i just gave up."
"decided to go back to the original buds that it came with, pictured here."
"needless to say, i tore one and gave up entirely."
"i hope betron is happy with their design, and i hope that they, their reseller, and amazon are happy with my $14."
because i don't consider it worth all of the effort and driving to return these.
"so they can keep my money, but i am never going to get to use these."
"indeed, this is the purchase that turned me off from using amazon altogether."
"every single purchase i've made from amazon over the past 2 years was a terrible experience, from getting the entirely wrong item, to electronics dying in less than 4 hours of receiving them, to literally being unable to even use them, such as this case."
i don't blame anyone but my terrible luck.
but i'm also not stupid enough to put my hand on the stove the fourth time.
i'm only sticking to buying things that i can physically test first-hand from now on.
"but if you're a person who needs to replace the padding on earbuds often, for whatever reason, i advise you think long and hard about purchasing these."
"personally, i'd suggest you go somewhere else."
but the decision is yours.
i believe better sound could be had if the rubber ear inserts had a smaller hole.
i had to use equalization to get sound that i liked.
the bass seemed a little weak and the mid tones and treble sounded brittle.
"everyone hears differently, but i expected a little more from earbuds with such large diaphragms."
"they're ok, not great and it's reflected in the price."
"i've had these for well over a year now, and they still work great!"
my jack got a little bent because i wasn't being careful and it still works.
"other ear buds would've begun having problems after the jack gets bent a little, but this thing is still kickin."
sound quality is really decent too!
i'm a bass lover and this thing is alright for it.
"there is some noise isolation, but it's not too much"
and i like that because i like to kinda know what's going on around me.
i can still barely hear people if they're talking to me close.
"overall, great ear buds and"
they're durable af.
pros:
decent audiodurable!stays in your earcomfortable to wearkinda noise islolatingcons:
"no microphone, but this is the non mic version."
so not really a con.
hasn't broken or lost sound in one ear yet which means i don't need to buy another pair of earphones
and i really want to.
but i won't until this one breaks or loses sound.
conclusion:
buy these.
highly recommend.
"i bought 1 for my step mom and 1 for my little sister, and they both work just as great."
you won't regret your purchase of these earphones.
these are awesome.  
the sound is wonderful.  
"i also have particularly small ears, and these are comfortable.  "
"when i attach the small piece to insert into my ear, they stay put without hurting me.  "
"i will also say, i am about to order my 3rd pair..."
not because i just want 3 pairs (although that would be amazing) but because my p-
i-t-a cat also seems to love them.  
"while snuggling on my lap, she has bitten through the delicate wire on 2 pairs of these, the second time on the day they arrived!  "
grrrrr...  
enjoy them at the peril of your kitty's sharp teeth.
easily one of the best headphones i've ever had.
"i needed an inexpensive (and thus, cheap quality, right?)"
"headphones for work, and phone these while grazing amazon."
i took the chance of buying a product not from one of the big names.
"(panasonic, sony, bose, etc.)"
"i am shocked at how well made and great sounding these earbuds are!anytime i get new headphones, i test them out on ""prelude and fugue in c major, bwv 549,written for pipe organ."
""" the highs show off the high end of the earbuds, while still providing a heavy bass range."
i'm very happy with these.  
the way they fit makes a big difference for me - they stay in much better than the typical earbuds.
"i do have a lot of difficulty getting used to using them, but am assured that this is common - everybody has to get used to this and it will become comfortable in time.  "
i am a late starter : )
it is wonderful to be able to hear my movies while other things are going on around me
- i hear them so much better than i thought i was hearing them when nothing is going on around me now.
i bought these headphones for the advertised high bass.
my $10 skull candys from radio shack 10 years ago produce much more bass than these.
very disappointed.
also the odd shape of the in ear piece doesn't seal tight into my ears.
"i tried all the different size attachments, even the foam ones."
the sound quality is ok but not a wow factor.
sadly it's not worth my time and effort to return them.
i was blown away by how good these headphones are.  
all i wanted was an inexpensive pair to play my music trivia game.  
i have bluetooth ones for when i work out.  
but the sound quality was so good
", i have been bringing these to the gym with me...."
love the bass from these!!!  
definitely buy these if you have the chance!
didnt know what to expect with buying $14 earbuds.
actually surprised with the high quality of these.
"they are comfortable, have excellent sound and look good."
"listened to hardstyle, hip hop , house , and some pop music."
"(david guetta , nick jonas, chris brown,  r3hab, wild thing by tone loc and"
"even bee gees stayin alive, for example.)"
i bought 3 different earbuds and tried them all out to see which ones i liked the most.
two jvc and these betrons.
these betrons are by far higher quality.
"these have great bass in them too, not a fake sounding bass either."
the other earbuds i tried gave fatigue to my ears quickly.
so thats the biggest red flag.
these betrons dont do that thankfully.
give them a try
"i've never had expensive or fancy headphones, so i wouldn't know how these compare to anything like that."
"however, i do really like these"
they seem like they're really good quality for the price
and they look very sleek.
"my only complaint is that it doesn't come with additional sizes for the earbud part, because the default is too large for it to fit comfortably inside my ears."
correction:
it did come with additional sizes.
i just didn't bother to open up the travel pouch.
super happy now.
found product ok.
good quality.
replaced my old walkman earbuds...
sound not quite as good as old buds and walkman uses earbuds for antenna
.....
reception seems a little less.  
after a little trial and error got to fit ear.
also comes with additional sizes ear pieces.  
i like the way they stay in place.
did not really notice noise cancelling feature.
i use mainly doing yardwork and bike riding......
interested to see how hold up to be mainly outside use over time.
this is my second pair of betron bs-10 earbuds.  
i recently lost the first pair after having them over a year
and i was heartbroken.  
"most earbuds even the more expensive ones have shallow, empty sound.  "
"betron bs-10s sound is rich, full and definitely"
"bass driven, which i love."
my original set did not fall apart and were in perfect condition before they were lost and this after a year of very frequent usage.  
i would recommend this brand of ear buds any day of the week.  
delivery was very timely as well.
these headphones say one thing from start to finish - high end.1.
"beautiful, solid packaging2."
comfortable3.
sound greati was very surprised at the level of quality received for the price.
i expected a backup/throw away set to have for travel
but these are now my primary earbuds.
i am going to buy another set right now for when i end up losing them instead of replacing them when my skull candy buds fall apart again.
"i purchased these earbuds to replace a more expensive set that had just worn out, but didn't have the money to go big, as it were."
these were inexpensive but came with high reviews.
"upon using them, i can say they're pretty good; not great, but better than some."
"for me, the sound is just a bit muffled, but it might be just from where i'm used to something different."
"don't get me wrong, i think these are really good earbuds, and i would order again if needed."
"you won't get a bose-type sound, but for everyday use, you won't go wrong with these."
these are awesome.
they have clear sound.
i don't have to fiddle with the positioning to get optimal bass.
i put them right in and they fit good.
the drivers deliver good bass where the mids and highs aren't drowned out.
i use these for work in the day for active music when moving around and at night for clear soundscapes and binural beats before i go to bed.
so far so good
and they are still going in terms of sound and build; and at the right price.
thanks betron!
i will be ordering more.
i must say how impressed i am with these earbuds.
"i bought these after reading several positive reviews and figured,"
hey i'd give them a try.
"and for the price, i am very happy with how they are performing."
"i've always used the apple earbuds that came with my phones, but since i've used these i don't think i'm able to go back to them."
the sound quality they put out is fantastic.
i'm able to hear so many details that i hadn't been able to hear before with previous earbuds
and i'm able to listen at a much lower volume than i used to thanks to the sound quality.
the durability is something i absolutely love as well.
"i'm the kind of guy that just folds up his earbuds and shoves them in his pocket, essentially ruining them over time."
but with the material these earbuds are made of they're able to stand up to the challenge i give them.
i will say the only downfall of them is the size of the ear inserts.
they're a touch big for my ears
so it starts to feel uncomfortable after prolonged use.
i really like
"that other insert sizes were provided in the package, but they're either too big or too small as well."
not a fault on the product at all.
my ear canals are just kind of small i guess.
"anyway, fantastic product :)"
these are some of the best sounding and most comfortable buds i've owned!
"the driver housing, as well as the plug and point where the left/right cables join, is metal and very well built."
the way they fit in your ear is incredibly comfortable and secure.
great design!
"the sound is amazing, too."
full rich bass.
they don't get as loud as some earbuds i've used and they do leak a little outside sound.
i'm still experimenting with the fit
"so maybe with different earpieces i can get them to seal better, but otherwise they are perfect."
very impressive!
i'm underwhelmed.
"i bought these to use with my work computer, and the cord is so short there's no slack."
"it would work fine for your phone or ipod, but it fails on this application."
"as for the bass, it's barely there with moderate listening levels."
40hz at -3db is just detectable; these buds don't really hit their stride until 60-65hz.
the extremely generic beats clones
i bought three years ago (for eight bucks)
outperform these in terms of sound quality.
"i have average ears, but even the smallest ""silicon"" (false marketing,"
these are foam)
pads start to feel uncomfortable after about 10 minutes.
spend your money on anything else.
these aren't good.
for the price it's a good product.
it happened to not be for me because they're really painful for me to wear.
"i tried to use the smallest ear buds provided, i reversed them, tried upside down, tried not anchoring and just balancing them."
they hurt.
the packaging is beautiful.
"the cord is thick, and tangle resistant."
sound and canceling are good enough.
"this is best suited for those who can wear the largest fitting ear buds that typically come with a set, that way at least the smallest could fit you."
after two months of use i needed to replace the so called premium jbl ear phones that came with my roku ultra streamer.  
(roku claims a 29.99 value)  
"they were no better, actually worse than the cheaper 6.99/9.99 ear phone i've ordered in the past."
so i thought i would give these a try.
i'm glad i did!
"they come in a nice box, with a storage pouch and replacement buds for the ears."
the wire is heavier and better quality.
and best of all they are very comfortable and have a great sound distribution.
i don't think you will regret purchasing these.
this pair of earphones have excellent sound quality.
they are molded to nicely fit into your ear too.
i have been using these for awhile with not a problem.
"the earphones come in a nice pouch with extra covers and even a clip, it all stores within the pouch."
i am not easily impressed by ear bud style headphones.
"most either don't fit right, don't stay in right"
", don't handle sweat right, don't sound right, bass sucks and so on."
many pairs i have ordered recently are literally all of the above.
this pair is pretty awesome.
very heavy bass.
i cannot turn them all the way up on my iphone without some discomfort
(this is a good thing).
good job guys.
good to know there's still good products hiding deep in the bowels of amazon.
:)
sound quality is the only one i needed for this product coz it really delivered.
well balanced but still lack the effectiveness on the base other than
that it’s perfect.  
"tried on my cell phone , ipad , ipod and most of all on my hires player to which it delivers the best sound yet .  "
i gave
only four star could have been 4 1/2 but it won’t allow us to .
so far this is it for me and with regards to noise canceling it can be done better for future products .
they sound pretty good for a set of inexpensive earbuds.
they fit nicely.
long enough chord for me to put my phone in my pocket and still reach my ears
"but i'm 5'11.5""."
all in all great deal
and i use them frequently.
i have been using sony extended bass buds (about $50) for a few years.
i wanted a cheaper pair to throw in my car or backpack.
i tried a few but they were not as good as the sonys.....until now.
i really can not tell a difference between these and my favorite sony pair except cost.
maybe not bose
but they are comfortable and sound well.
as a bass player i like buds that allow me to hear the bass line...
these work.
"the offset design of the ear buds helps keep them in place when exercising, and the sound is excellent for the price.  "
"on first use, only one of the earbuds carried sound when plugged in to any of five different devises.  "
wiggling the plug-in jack in the devices provided erratic stereo.  
then it occurred to me to clean the plug-in jack with an alcohol wipe and that seems to have fixed the problem.
"these are good earphones , only thing i've noticed that everytime there is a kick on a song with a deep bass or expansive frequency"
it kind of covers treble and the voice of the singer
"when it shouldn't, but overall, not bad headphones , i had some earphones purchased twice from a local store from maxwell solid2 , for 12$"
", they didn't even last me 8 months both , one side always stopped working"
so what i wish for these earphones is to last at least 1 year
"+ , i generally take good care of my belongings."
i bought these because another reviewer commented on the warm tone these give music - something which i find sorely lacking in this digital age.
and the reviewer spoke truthfully.
the sound is warm and rich.
but the vocals and guitars do sound slightly muddier than i'm used to.
"if i had a more advanced equalizer to customize the other levels to accommodate the rich bass, i'm sure i could clean it up."
noise cancelling is spot on.
these will be great on my next flight.
"all in all, good enough for me."
the muddiness isn't so bad that i can't deal.
and overall sound quality is superior to the sony buds i've been buying for the last several years.
the sound of these earbuds is very good - better than a skullcandy pair i was using.
i’m able to hear more of the music with these.
"the bass is very good, but not overpowering."
i would describe the sound as balanced and clear.
i’m
sure i got my money’s worth.
"surely the units that cost several times as much must sound even better, but i see nothing wrong with these."
the materials seem to be quality.
the wires have a rubbery feel.
they are not flat and they will tangle.
the sound quality of these earphones compare very favorably to more expensive ones.  
with the help of a sound enhancer they are amazing.  
they are capable of excellent highs and bass with a little help.  
for the price i highly recommend that everyone try these.  
"they aren't perfect, but i am so happy with them"
i decided to try another model by this company.  
the quality of materials and finish are excellent.  
i rated these high for durability based on the materials and how well they appear to be built not on length of use.  
i just received these today.
these came in a suprisingly nice looking package/box - would make a nice looking gift.
"the form factor of the earbuds is not quite as smooth/minimal as they could be - there’s a little circular protusion on the part facing away from the ear, but this does not affect comfort."
they do sit a little bit shallow in my ear but they are comfortable and tend to stay in.
"cord, material quality etc is thin but somewhat rigid and seems well to be well made."
sound quality is really nice.
these were definitely worth the money.
"quick delivery, on time, very inexpensive for quality."
"great sound, which is the most important to me."
i don't regret buying them.
"however, they're odd oval shape, and silver part (driver?)"
make it
so they don't stay in my ears.
and i mean..not at all.
"they don't wrap around my ear comfortably to stay in, nor do they seal enough in the ear to cancel the outside noise like they're supposed to."
"i changed from the soft grey buds to the solid black foam ones, and they are better, but you only get one set of the foam ones and they rip really easy when putting them on the ear phone."
"because they are so inexpensive and the quality is excellent, i'm jerry-rigging them to fit while i do my work, but i would love it if the manufacturer would fix the design, so i could buy more."
"i would pay triple for them, if they did."
sound is fine for the price of the item.
"had a minor issue with the first ones shipped, the mesh on the left earbud was slanted a bit and caused some it to stick outwards which seemed dangerous."
i returned them out of fear of metal bits getting in my ear.
"the second pair i received also had the same problem on the left side, but not as bad as the first."
i haven't bought earbuds in at least ten years
so i don't know if messed up mesh is much of a concern or if its common.
"anyways: tldr - decent sound for price, earbud mesh might have issues"
i bought this earphone with the intention of casual use as a replacement to my lost xiaomi piston 2.i
don't claim to be an audiophile
so don't take this review too seriously
", i'm not an expert on these things."
two things that i immediately noticed with this earphone is that the audio sensitivity is high and there's a huge bass emphasis.
it basically means that this earphone is good for those audio devices with mediocre audio volume output.
it does the job on that regard.
"as for the audio balance, this earphone is too cranked up on the bass side, at the slight expense of the mids and the highs, in my personal opinion."
"do not expect balance on this thing, though i'm quite certain that there are other betron models more suited for that."
"this is something that you'll notice as an audophile, but for casual listening, people would be impressed, i'd imagine."
"there are certain music genres that are better suited for this setup, but certainly, this is not a one-type-fits-all kind of earphone for all music types."
"still, the built quality is quite okay."
doesn't feel cheap.
"i've been looking for a new set of earbuds, and i've tried and had multiple kinds in the past."
"i can safely say that the audio quality crispness is there, but there isn't much suitability for bass."
"it's there, but don't expect much from earbuds on that front anyway."
"in terms of how clear the audio is, its a 9/10 for me."
"these earbuds do not come with mics or music functions, probably to shave off the cost."
but they do have exceptional build quality to make up for that.
"they seem very durable, and i'll update this in a few weeks just to confirm but the metal-laced wired prevents tangle (to a large degree but not completely) and it overall has a pretty solid feel."
one other gripe is the buds.
they will 100% fall off if you are rough with your earbuds.
"shoving them in your pockets or backpack is asking for them to come off, never to be found again."
"they include a traveling case, and although i don't fiddle with small tedious things, i might need to actually use this one."
"they dig into your ear enough to maintain a grip, but not deep enough for sports use, look to other earbuds for a better grip if that's what you need."
"but overall, its a solid product with its focus being on its audio quality."
"don't know if i just expect too much out of a product only $13.99, but the filter mesh on both earbuds fell out after about a year of use.  "
looks like it was just cheaply glued on and was only a matter of time before it happened.  
sounds were mediocre and were on par with the price.  
bass was not impressive.  
appropriate value for this earphone
and i'm not terribly upset with what it offers at its price point...
but i would not buy again.  
just underwhelming in all aspects and not durable.
"the earbuds are large yet fit securely inside the ears, unlike the popular brand whose earbuds are too large for my ears  comfortable, stay in place for me."
"and the last pair have lasted well over a year and still working perfectly, unlike the same-priced brands in the store."
i highly recommend these.
"i tried these out yesterday and i'm impressed with the bass and the sound quality, the bass is great and the sound quality is fantastic, these are great, i've bought other earbuds that promise extra bass but don't deliver, these do."
wear these to ride my motorcycle to work.
"good, loud, clear music."
took some adjusting to the larger body earbuds.
the bass is good and loud.
bass is louder but not as deep as the subsonic bass on panasonic ergofit.
could be because of the fit and placement of the earbuds and not for a lack of effort on the part of the drivers.
should have spent $2 more and bought the model with microphone and controller buttons.
still a good quality buy all the same.
it's been 2 wks since i've started using this headphone
& i must admit that it has surpassed my expectations.
i hear everything clearly at d lowest volume on my device.
"it fits comfortably in your ears, there are also extra pairs of different sizes sent with the purchase."
the noise cancellation feature works extremely well.
i would recommend this purchase & i'm usually very critical of headphones
but this one is worth more than the price.
"these are, so far, the best earphones i've used for sleeping (white noise apps, etc.)."
"they are low-profile and don't form an airtight seal in your ear canal, but pretty close."
"this isn't a bad thing, it prevents that plastic 'crinkle' noise you get changing air pressure in your ears from using completely-airtight buds that can make it hard to fall or stay asleep."
the sound quality is also better than most earphones in this price range.
they also look great and
even the packaging and travel pouch show
that someone cared about the unboxing experience.
"well done, betron."
"the sound quality is pretty good, although i will say i was underwhelmed by the bass, considering these are “bass-boosted.”  "
"my last pair of headphones were cheap and broke easily, but i liked the bass and sound quality of those a little bit better than these.  "
"this might be the most durable pair of headphones i’ve owned, though, which is a major plus.  "
"also, the buds fit comfortably in my ears and rarely fall out.  "
these would be great to buy if you’re looking for a durable pair of cheaper headphones that don’t have the magnificent bass or sound quality of more expensive headphones.
"betron bs10 earphones headphones, powerfull bass driven sound, 12mm large drivers, ergonomic design for iphone, ipad, ipod, samsung and mp3 playersthese are the most comfortable ear buds ever!  "
"they are contoured to fit in like earbuds, but the bulk is not stuck in your ear canal.  "
they fit flat and they don't stick out of the ear.  
"so, they look nice, fit in nice and flush and have great sound with deep base.  "
my wife and kids tried them and now i have to buy two more  :-)
"for the price, these are awesome."
"good bass, clear sound"
and it comes with multiple covers for the speaker so you can find the size that will fit in your ear perfectly.
i use these at work and the gym.
they stay in place when i’m running and lifting weights and they drown out all the annoying coworkers at work too :)
these are the best earbuds i've heard for less than $100.  
"they've got a simple not too flashy ergonomic design, good quality wires, and for $13 they're an absolute steal.  "
i've tried a lot of different earbuds
", i lose them all the time"
"so i'm not looking to spend a ton of money, just something basic that sounds good and easily replaceable; as soon as i tried these out i was so impressed"
", i ordered 2 more.  "
these will be my new go-to earbuds.
great sound!
plus great noise isolation!
....
but this model does not have an inline mic.  
"i assumed they did, but they do not."
my own fault though
", i should have read the product description more carefully.  "
"as stated, these lil buds have a real good punch to them, they are very comfortable to wear, and look pretty cool to boot."
"as a bonus, i like the little clam pouch that comes with them."
the pouch keeps them tangle free in my pocket or bag.  
"the only knock i have on these, is that they are not the best at full range audio."
"the lows are great, but if you're looking for something with great full range, these are not it."
but!!!
for the price??
?
?
you cannot go wrong!  
i would buy these again but will definitely get the model that includes the mic for phone calls and such.  
"overall, pretty great ear buds!"
the sound quality of these headphones is fine.
"however, they are made out of an extremely sticky rubber that will get caught on everything and anything."
"they are not good for working out, because the sticky rubber will catch on your skin and violently rip the buds out of your ears."
it has happened to me often.
they also cause irritation on my skin because they are so sticky.
1/10.
this sounds great!
it literally surprised me when i was watching a documentary with a surround sound bass that kicked in.
it doesn't look or feel cheaply made at all--for any price.
"therefore, it shouldn't fall apart."
the only thing is...
it hurts your ears a little bit sometimes after wearing them for a long period due to the awkward design of the tip of the earphones.
it's a little bit wide.
"otherwise, they're perfect."
i hope they go crazy with the bass for the next one they make.
i'm grabbing a life time supply of these earphones in case
this company doesn't make it--before they come off the market.
these rascals are loud!!
"what, i"
can't hear you!!!
"the output is ridiculous and the only miff is they lack the high end, so if your have an equalizer, you'll need to promote the high end on these as the bass is overwhelming."
i use them for my daily walk and i can cancel out traffic quite easily.
"the fit is snug, they don't protrude from the ear much and they let you listen to what you want to hear cancelling out everything else.."
the packaging for this was just fantastic.
it was really neat and sophisticated and included things i didn't even think were coming.  
there was a magnetic click and a bag to hold the extra supplement of earbuds.
most of the times my earphones just come in a plastic bag
so it was great to have an actual box.
the earphone's sound quality is as good
i as it was mentioned in the advertisement; the only thing i am worried bout is durability.
based on my recent earphones they break easily with me
i am always on the move shoving them into my pocket and by 2 months there is some sort of damage.
hopefully with this one it will durable due to the extra bucks i spent.
oh and does anyone know how to exactly work the warranty i had one for my sonic earphone before
but i didn't really know how to use them after it broke on one side.
these are my new go-to wired headphones.
the price is amazing the and quality is excellent.
i immediately bought a second back up pair just to have on hand and just in case they change the craftsmanship.
good headphones for the price
"(update: now that i listen to them more, there is very little bass."
what do you expect from $12 headphones?
don’t think you’ll get much bass).
know that it does not have a mic.
"they don’t act like they do, but they also don’t make it clear enough."
i wouldn’t have bought if i knew they didn’t have a mic.
not sure why any headphones (outside of studio) would be made without mics in the current year
this is solid for most uses such as brain entrainment and music.
it has a flat response with deep full bass.
low ohm resistance at 16ohm
i believe based on performance from my phone and having used various buds with different characteristics.
i can describe it best as a mix of the sony extra bass xb50 and panasonic ergofits.
the question will be how long they hold up.
"with gold plated connectors and comfortable fit, i am very impressed."
the sony is too bulky and the panasonic bass is better than most but not quite there so it can blow with smartphone use and end up with a rattle.
"since these are 12mm, i suspect it won't be an issue."
this is a real review by a real person with a strong recommendation to buy these instead of ergofits or the sony xb50.
"only caveat is i don't know how long they'll last, but i'll update if they fail."
"ok, i look for phones, at a budget price, that can make the day go by.  "
this headphones work.  
just a level or three more bass added to your music without drowning the teble.
i switched out the silicon tips for memory foam tips and the fit is excellent.
youtube videos sound great along with my personal mixs.  
love the fact i don't hear co-workers bad daily reviews of netflix shows.  
good product.
"as a person who lives the hellish existence of wanting earbuds with good sound quality that last a long time but not wanting to pay a lot of money for them, this is a gamechanger."
"previously, i'd bought skull candy ones for about $15, and these easily blow those out of the water in terms of sound, quality of materials, and general feel."
"the audio is really clean, much better than the other earbuds i've gotten in my life, which have ranged from $10-$20."
"they don't fall out of my ears, they really are noise-canceling, and i can lie on my side without them poking into my ear uncomfortably."
"the additional accessories are nice bonuses, especially the foam buds included with the other extra rubber buds; they feel like earplugs and really help with noise cancellation."
"plus, you can register for free on their website and get a 12-month warranty."
there is no reason not to get these at this price.
fantastic!

"i bought this earphones, because it seems that it was one of the most bought and popular"
"i don't know if i receive a defective earphones, but it only works if i'm holding my phone in my hand"
"also when using the them indoors it seems like the person on the other end is screaming, it's also uncomfortable in my ears, maybe i received a bad set."
"best sound quality, and they look durable too."
time will tell.
"however, i sometimes receive electric shocks in my ears with these."
this is a completely new sensation for me.
my family members using the other two that i bought have not experienced this.
weird.

weird.
i bought these specifically to listen to music and bought another betron model simultaneously that is also excellent.  
"well made, non twist cord, feels quality, but most of all, good deep bass (not overdriven), balanced by open and natural mid range and highs, close to a rival for professional headphones."
"i have had dozens of earbuds, and i did a side by side comparison to these."
"at this price, you can't beat these betrons."
i gotten this pair of ear buds by wrong shipping.
"because i bought bs10 model, which identical to this model in everyway but with talking microphone."
"when i've realized that i've gotten the wrong product, i thought, no matter, within six months, the connecter of the audio jack will be broken, which happen to every pair of ear buds i've ever purchased."
"but not this pair, as i'm typing this, i'm wearing the ear buds in question, and it's still going beautifully."
"that's why i'm buying another pair of betron bs10, which i hope they will give me the right product this time, and the quality of this ear buds is not an anomaly."
"after the earbuds that came with my galaxy s8+ stopped working, my mom gave me a pair of earbuds to use.  "
"i really disliked the audio quality, so"
i decided to order these based on the price and all of the reviews that i read.  
"i don't know a whole lot about audio and can't really identify what a truly great sound is, but i am still fairly picky and these seem great to me for listening to music and watching videos.  "
"it took me some time to get used to the sound after being so used to my old earbuds, and i'm not really sure whether that was a difference in quality or they just sound different, but now i really like the sound"
and i love using these.  
"i haven't had them long, but from what i have seen the durability seems quite good, and they look pretty cool too.  "
"also, the packaging they come in is really nice"
:)  
"i don't know what a true audiophile would think of these, but from my experience i definitely recommend them."
i bought these to replace my skull candy ear buds that went kaput.
the sound is not even close to skullcandy’s.
i had to turn my volume way up
and it wasn’t as clear.
also the button on the cord that should allow for you to pause didn’t work.
don’t be fooled by the 9.99 price.
not worth it
for the quality of the earbuds you cannot beat the price.  
the attention to details such as packaging including multi-ear pieces along with a earbud cloth bag to store the set was a really nice touch by betron.  
sound is quite good and fit is very good for me allowing the bud to seal and block unwanted noise.  
so far listening has been around the house and when the weather breaks the real test will come in when i use them on the motorcycle communications system and if it can withstand the wind blast.
i'm actually giving these earbuds
"3 1/2 stars, mostly for the sound."
"after reading the reviews, i thought these would be better than the original earbuds that came with my ipod."
i found that i liked the original earbuds better and they fit better in my ear.
i didn't experience the heavier bass that people described and
i thought the sound was a little flat.
"that being said, these earphones seem to be pretty durable."
i've owned a lot of cheap headphones in my days.
my goto mid-level headphones are usually apple earbuds
which i feel strike a really good balance.
these phones have a strong mid-range and surprisingly decent bass.
"the highs are a bit harsh and the overall range is limited, but you could do a lot worse."
these are great backup headphones and solid for the money
if you need something for sitting and listening to music/podcasts/video/etc.
"these are great, especially for the price."
"i wasn't expecting much, just something to use for a trip so i wouldn't have to worry about my bluetooth headsets dying and these exceeded expectations."
"don't completely block out external sound, but they do a pretty good job at it."
"for cheap earbuds, these are simply fantastic.  "
"the cable seems to be good quality, as are the components attached to it.  "
the earbuds come with three sizes of those little rubber domes but they also come with a set of foam domes which i found to be more comfortable.  
the little carry pouch is well designed and convenient for keeping the cord from becoming tangled while in my laptop bag.  
"finally, the sound quality is decent for the form factor; certainly better than others i've tried.  "
i wasn't expecting much for $12
but
.... damn!  
would buy again.

absolutely amazing headphones for the price.
"looking through a wide range of headphones for a quick replacement for the ones i lost, i found these and read the review which cited the build quality."
"of course, i wasn’t expecting much when i bought them for the price, but these headphones blow me out of the water."
"the build quality is fantastic, quite honestly the best i’ve had in comparison to the apple earphones i used to use."
"these are robust, and they’ll last a very long time."
"the sound quality is amazing, and my only gripe is the lack of volume control/microphone, but i bought these headphones for cheap and am blown away by all other aspects."
"i would easily pay an additional $40 if there was volume control and a microphone, but otherwise highly recommend this product"
earbuds are awesome.
the metal construction is robust but not heavy.
they fit great and do not fall out of my ears.
the sound is very clear with very good bass.
"it could have a little more mid to make it louder, probably just my deaf ears, but the overall sound and bass are great."
i would put these up against any $100 earbuds any day.
i highly recommend you buy these if you are looking for a superb product at a reasonable cost.
like the carrying case as well.
deep bass as it said.
"i was nervous they would not fit inside my ear comfortablely, but they do."
nice buy for the price
", the sound matched some pricey skull candies i use to own."
stop using those temporary mono sounding ear phones and just get these.
"i know you lost,washed your good pair and thinking you will get by on cheap until you have money to get top dollar pair"
", that's a dream or a bonus check away."
"get these, they will not disappoint."
"i've own a lot of different brand head phones, more on the expensive side."
talk about quality with these ones.
"fit nice and snug in the ear, no ear pain with long use, one of the best designs i've seen for head phones, comes in a nice package with 6 different ear buds."
"the sound quality is so crisp, and the bass is 50/50 with the crisp sound making it just perfect."
"for this price, you're missing out if you go with a different brand"
"i was looking forward to using this earphone and when i got it, the sound was pretty good."
but i stop using it because i felt i was getting a shock for the ear piece...
it happened a few times
so i stop using them.
i wonder has anyone else had this same experience?
"i have several in-ear head sets and some are great and some not so good, but never got shocked."
maybe it's me
but i can't recommend this earphones.
the betron bs10 earphones i received had to go back.
the sound quality fell flat on its face.  
"no range, hollow, empty, lifeless sound."
if my pair was not defective (likely not) the validity  of highly favorable reviews must be questioned.  
too bad amazon does not use its ai prowess to identity and cull the fake reviews.  
"just the sheer number of like devices for sale, number of purchasees  and reviews, and the high percentage of favorable reviews sticks out like a sore thumb."
buying sony at best buy can't be beat.  
imho.
ymmv.
so i have an audiophile sound system an enjoy it immensely.  
no these headphones do not compare
but i don't expect them to.  
they are terrific through the mid range and balanced nicely in bass and treble.  
"smooth, comfortable, durable, and a pleasure to listen to.  "
get um
if you don't need all the bells and whistles and want something that (appears) will last a long time.  
only time  will tell though.
"originally i have purchased this earbuds for the wire and the earbuds casing for fixing another expensive headset, but i have to say i was amazed when i tried."
especially for the price.
"their is no volume control, because it's a pair of regular earbuds."
the sound quality is very similar to my earbuds
i got with note 8.
"if i have to get another set, i will definitely get this again."
deep bass noted by other reviewers is true but comes at the cost of other higher and mid-range tones being very muddy.
pleasantly surprised by feel of materials and packaging (as if packaging really matters).  
comes with pouch to keep them.
parts that look like metal feel like metal too.  
"plug is very good and the wire is thick, and almost tangle free.  "
"comfortable, almost as much as the panasonic ergofit.  "
all in all worth what i paid.  
~11 dollars each.  
i bought two pairs at once.
i like these.
the sound and build quality are very good for the price.
"the only quibble i have is i wish they would put l and r indicators on the two sides, as there is only one way they can fit properly and labeling them"
would make it easier to determine which side is which whenever you go to put them on.
this pair of headphones has no static.
the other betron headphones that has the microphone and volume control gave me electric shocks.
"also, this headphones does not make my volume go automatically to zero randomly."
such nice sound out of a very inexpensive set of earbuds.
high quality construction and
i am only guessing
but i suspect the durability will be high also judging from the materials used.
i personally would rather have a symmetrical design
but i bought on the basis of my research of ratings
and i am not disappointed with the sound reproduction.
by far the best set of earbuds that i have owned.
i apparently have ear canals that are different from other people's -- the smallest rubber pieces on other in-ear headphones
don't fit me.
so this review might not help you.
"these fit me very nicely, so i bought several pairs."
i believe that the value for the price is excellent.
i have not used them to work-out.
i'm rough on earbuds and these didn't last more than a few weeks.
i usually fall asleep in them at night and the rolling and tossing and turning does a number on them.
these didn't even last the usual 3 months i can get from the $5 wal mart ones.
"they didn't sound too bad, but with so many options out there, i know there's something better in the same price range."
i like the way these fit my ears.
they are comfortable and stay in place.
"the sound cancelling is great, i wear them in an open office setting and they block out all that officer chatter."
i am in love with these.
"i have long hair, so i've always struggled with headphones snagging."
the design of these keeps them flush with the side of my face.
they've not fallen out once.
the oval shape of the actual ear buds has also been surprisingly comfortable--i wear them all day at work and haven't been getting headaches at all.
wish they had a mic
"so i could use them for calls, but definitely going to purchase again in the future regardless!"
"ok so i broke my real oem akg ""tuned"" headphones that came with my note 9.  "
i purchased these betron and some more akg headphones here on amazon.  
the betron are on par with the akgs that come with android phones and probably better.  
these sound is pretty good with decent base and they fit in the ear great.  
do not buy akg here on amazon.  
for some reason they are fake knockoffs and sound horrible.
terrible sound quality!
"after 2 days of use, these randomly shocked my ear.  "
"i tried to return with the square trade warranty,  "
but that is a joke.  
they couldn't locate my info and wouldn't refund me
amazing packaging.
these are slightly above average ear buds but the bass isn't what i was expecting.
extra bass should mean more bass.
not so with these.
plenty of ear fitment options
but they didn't fit in my ears
so well.
i bought these and use then with an earbud amp.  
"so, these little beauties deal with my regular phone volume plus and amp on top and perform like magic.  "
how are they so cheap?
i spent twice as much on some sony earbuds and blew one.  
it started clipping badly.  
granted ive used them only a few times.  
but they take all this amp can give.  
i cant even crank it all the way up.  
"nice cord, good connex, just boss all around.  "
would pay twice as much had i known.  
very happy puppy right here!
"i stumbled onto these when looking for wired buds without a mic, and am glad i did!"
build quality is much higher than expected for the price.
"the bass might be a little heavy for some users, but it is how i like my music"
so i enjoy it.
"sound is clear and well rounded, no sharp highs."
the extra buds make the fitment great and are soft and comfortable; the shirt clip keeps the wires where i want them; the carrying case/pouch keeps everything together.
"overall, i’m very satisfied and would highly recommend."
i am not an expert in headphones
and i am not interested in expensive versions.  
"but, i do like to listen to music and audio books when i go on walks in the city, so the quality of the headphones are important.  "
i have tried four versions and this one is the big winner.  
"when i lose these (or when my wife or kids grab them), i will just buy them again."
pro:
biggest bass i've ever heard from an earbud.
(12mm drivers + ported)
bob marley would
approve.con: not as good for jazz or classical.  
"if you drive these to max volume, the mids/highs  will become a muddy  mish-mash."
conclusion:  
buy these for big bass and the ysm1000 for everything else.
this has incredible sound quality for the price.
much better than i really expected.
i use headphones for listening to the bass guitar part of songs i want to learn.
this has sound quality that compares to full size headphones costing 10 times more.
quality construction too.
i might buy a second pair as a spare.
i’m well satisfied with my purchase and can honestly say these are the best ear buds i’ve ever owned.
however tho i cannot compare them with the really expensive kind because i only ever buy the $10 to $30 range but these are the best in my experience for the price.
i use them daily commuting by crotch rocket and they stay in place nicely when putting on my helmet.
good range of frequencies and loud enough to almost cut the wind completely out.
love the braided wires and the packaging was a pleasant surprise with several sizes of ear buds and also a pair of foam buds that conform to the shape of your ear canal.
i was pleasantly surprised when i first received these headphones.
very nice quality and extremely comfortable to wear.
"as a musician and songwriter with quite a bit of recording experience, i'm sensitive to audio quality and find these to do an excellent job of delivering an enjoyable listening experience!"
i use these headphones for gaming.
some of the best i've ever had.
this brand continues to surprise me every time i buy their products.
the music alone is outright amazing with these headphones.
"less than a week in, i really like these earbuds."
i can't speak to how long they'll last but for the price
they are great.
"sound quality is good enough for me, i mostly listen to podcasts and some music."
i wouldn't consider them noise canceling.
"the design is good, fits in my ear well and stays in, i wouldn't try to sleep in them though."
"i bought at least five pairs of headphones in the past couple of years, ranging from $10 to over a $100."
"i got these for watching videos to fall asleep with, and for that they are perfect."
"for a side sleeper, the buds are so comfortable i can't tell they are there."
"the sound quality isn't as good as the top brands, but for what i need it's more than adequate."
i bought these to serve as a spare in the event that my wireless headphones aren't charged up.
i read a previous review that said the sound was a bit tinny.
that's a fair evaluation.
these are good headphones for the price and deliver crisp sound.
the carrying case is very convenient as i have lots of wires and cords in my school bag.
the cord is like tubing which is awesome for resisting tangles.  
it is also connected with metal hardware
so you know this will last.  
the ear pieces fit perfectly without any ache at all.  
they also include multiple fitting options in a small baggie that you use to store these in after use.  
"lightweight and with a nice, long cord with optional shirt clip."
i like how it came with a carrying case.
it's really convenient for keeping your headphones untangled (if you coil them up every time) and dont need to be pulling the cords when you have to take them out of your bag.
the only thing i can't say for sure right now is how durable they will be.
i have had trouble with lots of headphones that last me only a couple months and hoping these will last a long time.
i will be sure to come back and re-comment if they last me a year.
i wanted some low profile headphones to listen to asmr while laying in bed and trying to sleep.
these work great!
they come with rubber and foam ear buds.
i use the foam because they are softer while i sleep.
i can lay on my side without feeling like my earphones are being jammed into my brain.
great buy in my opinion.
lovely packaging.
i like the small baggie to store the extra ear rubber pieces.
i could also store the headset in the little bag.
"now about the sound quality, it is similar to studio acoustic production mixing.  "
"great buy, its fits comfortable and after sometime you dont even feel it in the ear."
very nice earphones with very good sound quality.
reasonably priced (i paid $12.99).
apparently solid construction.
easy to open packaging.
includes a nice soft carrying case.
"i especially like the slim plug (the main reason i purchased this brand), which is needed to access the port through the protective case on my samsung phone."
"i've only had the earbuds a few days, but, so far, i would recommend them."
"i've had the headphones now for just about a week, so i'm not able to say anything about their long-term use, but so far i am very impressed by the quality of the headphones, especially for their price."
"the design of the earpieces is similar to others that i've seen, but i quite like the way they fit, almost acting as a noise buffer to outside noises."
"my only ""issue"" would be that they become uncomfortable in the ear after an extended period of time, but it's only a minor discomfort, and some adjustment of their placement or a break from use resolves the discomfort."
"i definitely would recommend, especially if you're like me and dislike over-the-ear headphones."
"i bought these because they looked like good quality earbuds, which they are.  "
i also bought them because they are ergonomic and fit perfectly in my ears.  
i can't wear regular earbuds because i have little ears
i guess because every pair always tend to fall out.  
i like the quality of these earbuds
", however, the back piece is just a little too big for my ears because while wearing them, it pushes against my ear and is uncomfortable.  "
when i took them out it felt like my ear was bruised.  
i wish the outside was a little bit smaller.
i'm always looking for cheap quality headphones because i refuse to pay a hefty price for items i can't keep up with and these fit the bills.  
sound quality is crisp and clear and they fit nicely in my ear.  
the cord seems durable but time will test its durability.  
these were included in the daily deals
so i was able to save a few bucks.  
great buy!
"i was looking for some budget earbuds to beat around (yard work, walking, house chores etc.)"
came across these.
it is a good purchase.
"the sound is crisp, clear highs"
but i would say the bass is not powerful as the description.
but for this price range it is a good buy if you are not an audiophile.
sound isolating is okay but don’t expect sound cancelling.
"excellent packaging, comes with different size ear pieces and a pouch."
for a budget conscious consumer it is a great buy.
a tremendous set ofwired  ear buds and the harder wire makes for much easier retrieval when you store them in your pocket or loosely.  
the sound is really good but light on the bass
but i wouln't expect that for less than $15 headphones.  
these will definitely be m gotos for the gym and biking.
great product for a very reasonable price.
the sound is amazing.
very crisp and clear with no buzz.
the quality of the product is top notch.
love the extra cord reinforcement.
does not tangle.
the bag it comes with is excellent and the perfect size for stowing.
the packaging this set arrived in was very professional as well.
bought one for my son who goes through headphones like they grow on trees
and he has yet to figure out how to damage this one.
we have a winner!!
i would highly recommend.
mediocre build quality.
i went through 3 of these in a span of less than half a year.
"the first broke when i dropped my phone while it was plugged in and the usb snapped off on my dorm floor, but that's to be expected."
"the next two pairs would have the right earbud stop working after less than a few months from regular use, and the problem seems to be with the cable connected to the usb."
"a minor problem, but"
i also noticed a sight shock in my left earbud whenever my phone is bouncing around in my jacket pocket while i'm walking.
"the sound quality is good considering the price, but i'm not sure if i want to buy anymore considering the mediocre cable."
these economical in ear headphone sound pretty good and are exceptional value for money.  
"i was surprised they sounded so good, but they do feel a tad heavy, which might well be expected considering the vey reasonable cost  "
well made and the wiring feels robust enough endure.  
they are comfortable in the ear and do not fall out.
i replaced these with expensive wired head pods which never stayed in my ears.  
the ergonomic design of the ear pieces keeps them from falling out (i use primarily for walking).  
there are 2 optional size
ear pieces included.  
who says you have to spend lots of money for good sounding head pods?  
get these instead
i like to sleep with something on from a podcast.
most headsets stick out too far to make that possible.
this headset sits very close to the ear and is comfortable to roll onto your side.
"regardless of that, it's comfortable, the cord is high quality and the sound is good."
"this is a great deal, and it comes with a nice storage pouch."
"these are so uncomfortable, not sure how theyve gotten good reviews so far other than the low price."
"ear piece is jammed up against the plastic, so the bud ca'nt fully enter your ear unless you enjoy pain.  "
sound is average.
wires are so thin they get tangled in no time/are so delicate.
"also, no microphone :/ just going to replace my old sony bass boosters instead."
"(they de-tangle easier, are comfortable, good sound,  and have a mic."
lasted 3yrs).
"fits nicely into your ear because of the curve, just love the overall bass when hearing any rap song in particular beastie boys, $uicideboy$, lil uzi vert, and etc."
also like that it was a cheap price to have good quality as this.
"love it, thx redcoats."
edit: upgraded to 4 stars.
"originally i thought the sound was muddled and flat, but i must say i'm now impressed with the sound after a few hours of listening time -- i suppose these may have required some ""burn in"" time to get a good sound."
"so as a note to all users, give them a few hours before forming an opinion."
"i'd describe the sound as strong in mid-tones and ""full"" and ""warm."""
"not the sharpest on the treble, and perhaps not the heaviest bass, but definitely a strong and encompassing low and mid-range."
i'm now a fan.
good deal for the price.
"i go through a lot of earbuds just from excessive use during workouts, so i never really like to buy expensive ones"
& i am always a little skeptical when i buy cheaper
(cost effective)
earbuds.....  
but these are great!  
sound is clean & awesome & very comfortable in my ears during my workouts!
"i am an audiophile by no means, but i do know what i like."
"even though i have bt earbuds now, i saw these had a larger driver, and excellent reviews, so"
i decided to try them.
"so far, i am very, very glad i did!"
"the larger drivers(12mm) seem to give these better low end response, and crispness."
the high end is just as good!
"i have no complaints, so add me to the long list of 5 star reviewers!"
i was ready to return it but decided to keep it asa backup.
it does not have the ‘bass’ you note in your description.
it’s ‘tinny’ and also does not sit in my ears no matter what adapter i use.
i have another product that i am going to keep as my ‘go to earbuds.
headphones sound and feel like they should cost at least $30!
comes with a case and extra rubber covers.
sound quality is excellent!
for 13 bucks you can’t  get a better set of earbuds!
"earphones are really comfortable for me, comfortable enough to sleep with."
"good sound overall, could do with a bit more bass, but that's kind of subjective."
great
and i mean great quality.
"i've been using them almost every day for a month, not a spec of a problem."
i would definitely buy again.
fits nice and snug in my ears.
the little pack it comes in is great too (now ill always want a little pack for my earphones) and i can carry the other attachments around anywhere for any situation now.
and the cable seems harder to get all twisty (tangled can still happen of course but keeping them in the little pouch
prevents that!)
which is really nice.
"coming off of apple earphones, id say the apple ones have slighlty better sound quality, and having the little volume button on the cable itself was nice too, but those are minor nitpicks."
this is a good product.
that is my 18-th headphone i bought from amazon on $10-$100 price range - and the best one for audio book listening.
the shape looks weird - however it fits perfectly and very comfortable.
the 12 mm size of drivers produces a natural sound similar to over-the-ear headphones.
you can purchase the right headphones without my long searching
:)  
if you need a super-bass for music - sony could be the right choice -
but if you need a natural voice sound - this is it.
i bought these as a surprise for my husband for when he does yard work.  
he was using the headphones that came with our phones
but they are super uncomfortable.  
i bought these because they were inexpensive and had really good reviews.  
he loves them!  
he actually enjoys doing yard work now.  
he really likes the fact that he doesn't have to turn the volume up extremely loud like with our other ones.  
the lawn mower and almost every other noise is canceled out
(i promise it's not selective when he's using them).  
i would totally buy these for myself if i was able to use earbuds more often.
i had bose earbuds and eventually after few years the wires gave up
and they were dead.
"i was looking for a cheaper alternative to try and found this one and decided to give it a shot, and oh boy this earphones deliver."
the bass is too good rivaling the more expensive earphones.
overall sound quality is also fantastic for the price point.
just don't expect absolute crystal clear high fidelity sound like bose or other expensive earphone.
but for the price point they are absolutely the best and can easily be your daily drivers and you won't be disappointed.
"overall, i'd say the sound quality of these headphones is pretty subpar."
the mids are very muddy.
"yet, the design of these headphones is fantastic."
"the cord is nice and sleek, and the drivers fit all the way into your ears."
most comfortable sleep headphones
"i've found, even if they don't sound great."
i'm not a big fan of earbuds with the rubber ear things because usually they are too big for me.
i was surprised to see that the alternative rubber things has a very small size that fits perfectly.
"the noise cancellation might be too good, there is even an earplug attach variant, so there's that."
"for that price, that sound quality is quite good."
"i'm no audiophile, but everything sounds clear to me."
"i'm mostly hoping this lasts for at least 4-6 months with heavy use, if it reaches that and more."
i'll gladly buy another pair when it wears out with a price point like this.
would recommend.
"company claims heavy on bass, which it slightly is."
"the headphones have slight larger magnets than most headphones, but the mids and highs aren't quite as crisp as i wanted it to be."
"it's kind of flat for my taste, but i can't complain for the price point either."
my favorite part about these headphones that others can't achieve is the ability to lay flat on my pillow ears down.
it's actually comfortable!
i can watch movies and listen to music w them on while i doze off!
it sits flush w my ears
so kudos to that!
"yo, these headphones are by far the fanciest, gorgeous, most amazing buds ever!"
"the cord is strong, the earbud design is comfortable."
i loved the packaging and the pouch with magnetic closure.
and the sound?
so good!
"i ""tested"" it when my brother had his loud friends in his room."
fell asleep and stayed asleep like a baby.
👍
it came in a neatly packed (and fancy- at least to me) packaging.
"the sound quality is excellent, with quite a bit of bass which i enjoy."
i was excited to try these out after seeing so many positive reviews.
while i think the build quality and presentation is excellent.
"nevertheless, the sound quality is just alright."
"for a lesser price and better sound quality, i would rather buy the panasonic ergofit."
not happy with these earbuds sound.
they just sound really echoing with almost no bass
what so ever. :((
i needed to replace the buds with “double flange” buds.
love the quality and sound
but i have small ears and the buds kept falling out of my ears.
"however, once i replaced them with “double flange” buds, i was all set."
"i really love these earbuds, i have super sensitive ears and they’re probably the most comfortable pair"
i’ve ever owned.
"and they actually stay in, which is a nice change of pace."
i can put them in and forget about them.  
it’s even comfortable to sleep with them in.
"they sound great, too."
i mostly listen to rock and they have just enough bass for my preferences.
the build quality is really nice as well.
the metal components give them a nice heft and make them feel more substantial than other earbuds
i’ve owned in this price range.
the cord seems sturdy enough.
i like them
so much i bought a second pair for my mom.
i haven't used these for working out because i have wireless ones for that
but i imagine they'd work well.
they fit snugly in the ear so they probably wouldn't fall out while running.
they're great for everyday use tho.
sound is just as remarkable as it claims
i like these for the good sound.
just don't have the big bucks for top quality ear buds.
these work fine.
still wish they had some better base though.
good value for the money.
"now, just hope they last a while.  "
i would recommend these.

"now, just hope they last a while.  "
i would recommend these.
i bought these to use for radio interviews online for noise cancellation and clarity without the conversation being picked up and making the interview sound muffled and they work great for this specific purpose.
i love these earbuds; i use them mainly at the gym.
"they have great sound; heavy on the bass, so i can zone out, while i workout."
this is one of the best wireless earbuds i have used so far.
every feature is great just like described.
the set of earbuds provides amazing beautiful sound quality.
i can always get incredible stereo sound without bothering others.
the feature “auto power on and pairing” works pretty well every time i take them out from the charging case.
"after use and put the earbuds back to the case, the charging indicator light will be flashing on showing that the charging is working now."
the large capacity of battery can charge the earbuds many many times.
the case also has charging port designed for usb device.
"in emergency time, it can be used to charge my phone a little."
the in-ear design can fit in my ears perfectly.
"once put in, they never fell off my ears not like other earbuds i used before."
"the one touch control can be used to play, pause, answer the incoming calls, hang up, power on and off."
i didn’t find out how to use them on volume control and track change.
"in a whole, this set of wireless earbuds is beyond my expectation."
i like it and use it every day.
i received the headphones today.
"when i opened the box, i have never expected this is such excellent headphone."
it comes with a charge box with two wireless headphones inside.  
"in the instruction, i noticed the capacity of the charge is 2200mah, it is quite a high capacity enough for recharging several times of the headphone."
three light showed the remaining charge cost.
good design!
"get out the two headphones, the blue and red signals light on, means i could link to my iphone."
searching the headphones from my iphone is straightforward.
"in the headphone, i could hear that the headphone was connected to my phone."
"opening my music, i was so excited."
the sound quality is excellent.
i think it is better than my other wire headphones.
"that is a good headphone, not expensive but good sounds quality for sure!"
i recommend this product to you.
trust me.
you won't regret it.
:j
ear problems have plagued me my entire life
so earbuds are always an issue for me.  
i usually have trouble getting them to stay in because of multiple ear surgeries.  
these earbuds are very comfortable and stay in my ears even when i am sprinting on the treadmill.  
"the sound quality is wonderful, as well.  "
for this part of the review i will let you know what my husband says because i have to listen to my music at a low level due to my ear issues.  
"my husband who is a old school rocker all the way, says that the bass is fantastic and offer a quality listening experience.  "
we both feel that the earbuds are lightweight and hold up well to sweat while working out.  
"battery life, at least while they are new is pretty decent also.  "
we have been able to use them while working out every day for an hour and a half at a time and only had to recharge at the end of the week.  
( note:  
we work out 4 times a week).  
"as for set up, it was incredibly easy.  "
"once you set it up, you simply take them out of the case and they turn on and link up to your device!  "
it is that easy!  
"i will say that while cleaning the house and listening to an audiobook, i left one room, and my phone to go into another room and"
the sound became very scratchy.  
"i am unsure of the distance, but you don't have too much range.  "
"all, in all, this is a fantastic product at a great price."
i went into this with a heavy dose of skepticism.
i have weird tiny ears
"so earbuds are never comfortable, and i am just a bit of an audiophile and earbuds have never stacked up."
"that said, i have about 20 hours of airports and flights coming up,"
so i wanted something small to pack that wont mess up eyemasks and sleep attempts.
these caught my eye because of the self charging case and long play time.
so i gave them a shot.
"the case is tiny, the top is just see through enough to see the charging lights"
so you don't have to open it to check on the progress.
"red lights for the earbuds and blue for the case, love that they did different colors."
"the earbuds come with a bunch of extra rubber bits in different sizes, and they actually fit comfortably in my ear!"
"no pressure points, nothing."
i am stoked on that alone.
"so i connect them to my phone (super easy to do, instructions included) and pop on my all time favorite band (ghost)"
so i can judge them on something i know by heart.
"the sound is clear, crisp enough that i hear all the little stage details in the live album."
the base is amazing.
i have never had earbuds with bass!
"the stereo is spot on, and the vocals are beautiful."
they are super comfy under my knit cap (
i
m cold
what can i say)i am super happy with this purchase.
"i bought them expecting it to be a trip expense but not something i would use outside the rare occasion, but these are going to end up being my go to headphones now, and i never thought i would say that about ear buds!"
i think they might out perform a few of the bluetooth speakers i have scattered about the house.
"i am shocked, i didnt expect to be happy, but i totally am."
"oh and they have tap controls to do volume,"
"call control, and pause."
i look like a goober tapping my ear when people talk to me to pause and saying 'what'?
"but i don't care, ive got music to listen to people!"
these ear buds are very nice.
they are easy to use .
they almost cancel noise 100% which is very nice
so you can still hear what's going on around you.
loving the fact that there are no buttons to turn these on and off.
it's all touch.
and that they can charge your cell phone as well.
it's a pretty neat addition to these cool ear buds.
the sound quality is amazing.
they have the perfect amount of everything to listen to music or watch movies.
these ear buds are very worth the investment.
you get a few ear cushions of different sizes to make sure of the right fit.
and they are comfortable to wear.
i would definitely  repurchase these again.
my household are fans of these.
we now own 2 pairs.

install flash player just got my ear bud very quick
and i cant wait to try it and review about it.
this is my first wireless ear bud at whole time
and i was always worrying about the duration of the ear bud
because i mighy use long hours without charging.
"but i saw my friend having a wireless ear bud and kinda look forward to having my own since i really dont remember how many corded earphone i ruined in the past as i like to listen to music on bed, sometimes the line will just choke around my neck when i wake up."
thats why i need wireless which means no
trouble.the one i bought isnt apple brand
and i dont
"like apple brand stuff very much , so i try different."
"the ear bud comes with a charger with usb and otg heads, means even if i dont need the ear"
bud
i can still use it to charge my phone with a cord.
"a short usb cord and a bag is included, i like the bag but the usb is too short.the"
quality of the ear bud is good.
it almost pair up instantly when i turn on bluetooth.
i used the ear bud to listen.to youtube hd videos and found the quality of the sound is just like the original good earphone.
"i am not having a professional ear like my brother do tho, but i think the quality is just not losing to the cord one."
"the battery life is ok, i used it over an hour still no problem yet, i havent tried the longest time it can be use wirelessly tho, will try later.overall the earbud worth 5 stars to me, i hope it will last longvand"
i dont need to buy any cord in a near future again .
i have tried several wireless bluetooth headphones and these are probably my favorite.
they connect with bluetooth effortlessly.
the sound is great and they are noise cancelling.
they are supposed to be waterproof which is a huge plus(i say supposed because i haven't tested it).
i've had friends that have ruined headphones just from wearing them to the gym and sweating so being waterproof is awesome.
"they are touch sensitive, you don't have to fish around for a button to pause"
just touch the headphone
and it pauses.
they are awesome
you.
guys.
i am not hip or up to date on what is cool in any sort of technological way.
my friend mentioned thinking wireless ear buds were a great idea.  
i ordered her a pair for a christmas gift.
"then, after all of her talk about how great they were, i decided to order myself a pair."
i am now a believer.
so convenient.  
they are incredibly user friendly - even for a novice like me.  
"i put them in my ears, listen to audio books, podcasts, music, while i work, clean, do house work, whatever needs doing.  "
if i need to talk to someone or listen to something else
i just pull one ear bud out and the music or audio book pauses automatically.  
it's magic.
the sound quality is amazing.  
i kind of wish it would go a little softer.  
"even on the lowest volume in my phone, it's still plenty loud."
i really do see why everyone loves these.
and these have a convenient carrying case
and i have not even had to charge them once
and i've been using them for a while.
all around - fantastic.
these bluetooth earbuds are really nice.
the sound is impeccable and clear.
these connected to my devices easily
and i do not have any problems when using them.
i really like that they have a touch pad on each ear
"bud so that you can stop, play, or pause what you are listening to."
you can even answer phone calls.
this set does come with ear bud tips so you can use the one that fits in your ear the best.
i have not had a problem with these falling out.
the case itself is what charges the earbuds.
you just charge the case and put your earbuds in.
this is great if you are travelling.
it is a micro usb port and it does come with the charging cord.
"there are lights that show you when it need to be charged, when it is charging, and when they are complete."
the case itself is a 22000 mah power bank
so you can use it to charge other things too.
i have really been loving these earbuds and use them all the time.
surprisingly good sound for such cheap earphones.
i bought these as a backup for my apple airpods (since i leave them at home sometimes) and these exceed my expectations.
"they even have a few features that the airpods do not have, like the ability to change the volume with them."
"my favorite secret feature is that the charging case not only charges the earphones, but can also charge your phone two times!"
great feature.
highly recommended overall.
i love these true wireless earbuds!
im always on the go
"and it makes my day so much easier to talk to people and to listen to my music, the sound quality is great and sounds super clear."
these bluetooth headphones are some of the best wireless headphones i have ever had.
there comfortable easy to work and they have great sound an noise cancelation.
"the battery life of the in-ear headphones is excellent, and the battery bank base has an extremely long life."
i had a bus ride that was 2 to 3 hours long and didnt have to plug them in at all.
great for every activity you can imagine.
i really like these bluetooth 5.0 headphones.
"i use these true wireless earbuds at the gym, and not any issues with running with them and also when i'm doing working."
easy to set up.
"of course, the sound quality is super good."
very quiet
and i can have a rested.
the charging case is great.
"did not fall off, the music has not been interrupted, the battery life is amazing, you can also use this small charging case to supplement their power."
i am very happy with them for the price point.
i would recommend these wireless bluetooth headphones.
"this is my first set of earbuds, and so far so good."
they paired to my phone instantly.
"i listen to podcasts a lot, and everything comes over crisp and clear."
part of my job requires headphones for protection from loud equipment.
"these earbuds add another layer of protection, and i can hear them beautifully with the headphones over them and an insanely loud gigantic shop vac right beside me."
the manual is pretty sketchy.
"i can't figure out the ""pressing the button"" maneuver when answering the phone, or when advancing to the next song."
"there is no button, and no give."
"i'll figure it out someday, but am irritated at whoever wrote the manual."
"in any case, i enjoy having these, and would recommend them to friends."
smart little earbuds with cutest storage cum power case which you would like at first thought.
their quality is not as not something you compare with bose or other big brand earbuds
but these are definitely good earbuds
pretty decent earphone.
never loses its bluetooth connection.
easy to pair both ears.
sound is more balance without super high bass.
i like the fact that the earphones are molded to the shape of ears.
just the right size not to big.
and the plastic construction is sturdy.
wish it had usb c
but it comes with micro usb

"the sound quality is excellent, it is heard clearly and without interruption, it fits perfectly to my ears, i love that they are very comfortable and do not hurt, the battery life is super good, the box is small and light, they are also resistant to the water, they are simply perfect."
i just purchased these bluetooth headphones and i'm very impressed with the sound quality.
i have never used outdoor portable bluetooth prior to this.
"you can use one or both ears,  the charging case is holding good backup to charge these multiple times."
i use these in-ear headphones both sitting at my desk at work and when i am out walking
/running.
i would 100% buy these true wireless earbuds again because they surpassed my expectations.
i have already recommended sport wireless earbuds to my other gym friends.
these are absolutely perfect in every way!
these wireless bluetooth headphones are great for listening to music or chatting away while you drive.
ive only had these true wireless earbuds for a week
but ive used them everyday; when driving and around the house!
the sound quality of these bluetooth 5.0 earphones and volume is perfect.
"it accidentally fell into the sink once, i picked it up and wiped it clean, and it can still be used."
really couldn't ask for better!
the sound quality of these true wireless stereois very great and really happy that i bought it.
i no longer need to hassle with my wired earphone any more since this is wireless and i could do any task freely without any disruption.
these in-ear headphones are not bulky like some of the other ones.
"the case is also a small, and not super huge."
you can use just one (either left or right) or both
and they know how to pair in those modes automatically based on the sequence you take them out of the charging case.
i let my wife try these wireless bluetooth headphones on
and i think hes jealous of how great they sound.
well done!!
arrived and paired with my iphone
easily!the battery life is as described and the sound is very good!
i used these mainly at the gym and have not encountered any issues at all.

smart little earbuds with cutest storage cum power case which you would like at first thought.
their quality is not as not something you compare with bose or other big brand earbuds
but these are definitely good earbuds
i have always been looking for a hard and long time for bluetooth earbuds until to the set of earbuds.
they work well the same as described.
"when the wireless earbuds are taken out from the case, they will turn on automatically  and they turn off again once putting back in the case."
"i am a little lazy person,the feature of pairing with each other and connecting to the latest paired device is designed for me."
"most earbuds i've gotten won't last through a simple workout, let alone a run."
"these bluetooth 5.0 headphones were not like the others they are comfortable, stay in my ears, and sound great."
the only thing is i would practice using these sport wireless earbuds before you get to the gym.
"for me, controlling them was a little tricky at first."
"it took a day or so to get comfortable with the buttonless touch features, but after learning, it was simple and provided a clean interface."
"i highly recommend these wireless bluetooth headphones, especially for the price."
i was looking for a best sport wireless earbuds to exercise with.
"it has a very powerful cancel noise function, and has great sound, bass is good, my wife are envious of me to be immersed in my own music world, free from outside interference."
"love the battery life, and the charging case."
i never had one bad experience with these bluetooth 5.0 earphones.
"i have owned several different pairs of wireless headphones, these by far are the best i have gotten."
would recommend to everybody.
buy these true wireless earbuds for yourself who runs and you will absolutely love them.
"after the friends recommendation, i bought these bluetooth 5.0 headphones."
the sound quality for music playback is clear and immersive.
"call quality was good, without fuzz."
these true wireless earbuds comes with a charging case that you can put your headphones in when you are not using them.
"i also very love the charging case to keep them in, the battery life seems good so far, too."
"its amazing, it frees my hands."
"compared to what is currently out in the market, these wireless bluetooth headphones at great for the price."
"overall, very happy with this purchase."
wow!
these connect so easily and the sound quality is great.
"if you listen to your music loudly others will hear it, but that’s to be expected with most ear buds."

"of course, the sound quality is super good."
very quiet
and i can have a rested.
the charging case is great.
"did not fall off, the music has not been interrupted, the battery life is amazing, you can also use this small charging case to supplement their power."
i am very happy with them for the price point.
i would recommend these wireless bluetooth headphones.
"this is my first set of earbuds, and so far so good."
they paired to my phone instantly.
"i listen to podcasts a lot, and everything comes over crisp and clear."
part of my job requires headphones for protection from loud equipment.
"these earbuds add another layer of protection, and i can hear them beautifully with the headphones over them and an insanely loud gigantic shop vac right beside me."
the manual is pretty sketchy.
"i can't figure out the ""pressing the button"" maneuver when answering the phone, or when advancing to the next song."
"there is no button, and no give."
"i'll figure it out someday, but am irritated at whoever wrote the manual."
"in any case, i enjoy having these, and would recommend them to friends."
smart little earbuds with cutest storage cum power case which you would like at first thought.
their quality is not as not something you compare with bose or other big brand earbuds
but these are definitely good earbuds
pretty decent earphone.
never loses its bluetooth connection.
easy to pair both ears.
sound is more balance without super high bass.
i like the fact that the earphones are molded to the shape of ears.
just the right size not to big.
and the plastic construction is sturdy.
wish it had usb c
but it comes with micro usb

"the sound quality is excellent, it is heard clearly and without interruption, it fits perfectly to my ears, i love that they are very comfortable and do not hurt, the battery life is super good, the box is small and light, they are also resistant to the water, they are simply perfect."
i just purchased these bluetooth headphones and i'm very impressed with the sound quality.
i have never used outdoor portable bluetooth prior to this.
"you can use one or both ears,  the charging case is holding good backup to charge these multiple times."
i use these in-ear headphones both sitting at my desk at work and when i am out walking
/running.
i would 100% buy these true wireless earbuds again because they surpassed my expectations.
i have already recommended sport wireless earbuds to my other gym friends.
these are absolutely perfect in every way!
these wireless bluetooth headphones are great for listening to music or chatting away while you drive.
ive only had these true wireless earbuds for a week
but ive used them everyday; when driving and around the house!
the sound quality of these bluetooth 5.0 earphones and volume is perfect.
"it accidentally fell into the sink once, i picked it up and wiped it clean, and it can still be used."
really couldn't ask for better!
the sound quality of these true wireless stereois very great and really happy that i bought it.
i no longer need to hassle with my wired earphone any more since this is wireless and i could do any task freely without any disruption.
these in-ear headphones are not bulky like some of the other ones.
"the case is also a small, and not super huge."
you can use just one (either left or right) or both
and they know how to pair in those modes automatically based on the sequence you take them out of the charging case.
i let my wife try these wireless bluetooth headphones on
and i think hes jealous of how great they sound.
well done!!
arrived and paired with my iphone
easily!the battery life is as described and the sound is very good!
i used these mainly at the gym and have not encountered any issues at all.
very comfortable was well for my 1+hour sessioni
only have to recharge the case 1x every week or so10/10 would recommend!
i have used these wireless bluetooth headphones with my phone and computer and these bluetooth 5.0 earphones work on both with out an issue.
"i can use them to listen to my school lectures, podcasts, conference calls, and make phone calls."
they conform to my ears so that they don't just fall out.
"i also love the case, you get the same quality and comfort, including a very nice charging case."
i like these true wireless earbuds.
the charging bin is my favourite part.
"it could be fully-charged quickly and shows the power in real time,which is so great."
"this charging case is not big for me,so that i could easily put them into my bag, which is exactly what i need."
another great part about these headsets is that the bluetooth connection is very quick.
i can quickly connect them to my phone when i take them out of the charging case.
theyre so convenient to use.
"very comfortable, easy to pair with my cell phone, nice little carrying case (that is also a charger).not"
the loudest earbuds
"i’ve ever used, but they sound great and are plenty loud enough for me."
they come packaged very well and would make for a nice gift too.
these wireless bluetooth headphones have great quality and reasonable price.
the battery life is long enough.
the charging case is small but powerful.
"i dont charge the case othen,but usually it has enough power for me to use."
"just remember to put the true wireless earbuds inside the case when you finish using them,so that we could protect them well and make sure they have enough power."
very satisfied with them!
this is so cool product loved it
it's so so handy and compact the sound quality is amazing
and it's fits the ear so perfectly in all types of ears ...
the box is also amazing fits perfectly in my purse..
amazing product and grt fits to my ears
i have had other wireless earbuds
but these wireless bluetooth headphones are definitely my favorite.
stay in place and super comfortable and has great clear sound.
these ttrue wireless earbuds were very easy to pair and the sound can get loud!
i find the sound quality very good for both loud and soft volumes.
stay in ear pretty well
but i don't know about a super vigorous workout.
easy to charge with a nice charging case.
overall very happy with these earbuds
decent sound quality.  
i prefer having one earbud in at a time and these allow for that.
seem to be a great buy at a great price!
"i use them about six hours a day at work, and have never fallen below a 50%."
i am satisfied with these bluetooth 5.0 earphones.
want to buy one more in-ear headphones for my wife right now.
i use these earbuds primarily for listening to music and audio books while traveling. & still have a clear bluetooth connection.
"great true wireless earbuds, especially for the price."
nice pair of headphones in a snug case.
good for travel or working out.
i like the feature of being able to connect each headphone individually in case
you only want one headphone for listening.
"the case itself is small but easily fits in pockets, jackets, etc."
love the lights that tell me how much battery is left in the case.
sound quality is quite good for the price.
"mids are very clear and with a bit of modification, the bass can strong."
i'd recommend these headphones for anyone who isn't able to afford expensive brands but wants similar sound quality.

the buds are easier to pair than other earbuds i have used.
the sound quality is good.
"i'm just glad to have comfy, sweatproof running earbuds that give me satisfying sound.  "
no chance of having them fall out while running is ideal.  
best sport wireless earbuds.
the sound quality is great for the price
and i do not believe in spending that kind of money for something that i can so easily lose.
i would totally buy these in-ear headphones again for a gift.
great value for the money.
"finally, they are comfortable, and feel secure."
i bought these to replace the wired set that came with my son's phone as he lost them.
i bought a wireless set that didn't work so he wanted wired again.
i bought these because they were a good price compared to the original ones.
so far so food!
he says they fit his ear just fine and the sound is very good!
it came in a nice little case with an elastic pocket on the inside to the hold the different sizes of silicone ear piece sizes.
that's very helpful because we tend to misplace those.
the case is the perfect size for his backpack.
i would definitely buy these again.
(hopefully he won't lose these lol).
"should anything change after he uses them longer, i'll update my review."

and sounds better!
i love these earbuds!
the sound quality is amazing!
i didn’t realize how bad my old earbuds were until i tried these.
crystal clear sound.
fits very comfortably in the ears with extra smaller and larger size ear cushions.

these headphone are my new favorite.
the sounds and comfort out do any earbuds i’ve ever used i definitely recommend them
and i’m
for sure going to be ordering another pair
:) .
order asap you won’t regret it .  
p.s : it also comes in a cool carrying box to store them in :) 5 stars for sure
happy that i decided to give these headphones a try.  
the piece that inserts in the port is very steady.  
the earbuds are shaped in a curve fashion
so they slide right in your ears and feel comfy.  
there are extra ear buds too.  
the end of the cord does not feel like the apple chargers with the wires that fray either.  
the volume and mic works wonders.  
i keep these at my desk
so i can converse on the phone without bothering others.  
plus it has a carrying case.  
the volume is great also.
these are great iphone earbuds.
i used them for my iphone 7.
"they are great quality, and look great too."

this is good product.
it fits great in ear.
sound quality is good.
i wish the wire was little more thick but overall it a great product.
"the color i orded looks like a pink nude but in person it is more of peachy orange nude, but it is still a beautiful color and it goes with my skin tone quite nicely."
"i am pretty much casper white with strawberry blonde hair and freckles, so peach tones always pair well."
it is also light enough for me without completely washing me out.
most nudes tend to be either too dark in comparison to my skin.
so this is a good amount of pigment for me.
"i wouldn't call this a matte lipstick though, or particularly long lasting."
it isn't shiny like a regular lipstick but it doesn't dry like a matte.
it kind of has the feel of chapstick.
i really like it though
and i will be ordering more shades.
this is a great piece furniture.
i have been want a jewelry cabinet for a long time.  
"after some researches, i am glad bought this one."
the full length mirror looks great.
"easy to assemble, the storage space inside is incredible,  there are many space to categorize my jewelry, lipsticks, necklace, earrings etc."
"now i can easy to find the jewelry i want to wear in the morning, compared before i have to put my jewelry in the boxes, i can’t find them."
this is definitely great help.
"great value, recommended to whoever looking for functional piece of jewelry cabinet like this one."
i'm sure many ladies out there have had lipstick malfunctions where you might be digging around in your purse and either your favorite lippie pops outta your purse like a hot rivet and crashes to the floor
leaving the clear plastic cap
"a cracked,  broken mess, or worse"
", the cap comes off in your purse and lipstick ruins the inside of your purse..."
ugh!well
", i decided to give a makeover to my favorite lippie by giving them a new home in one of these high-end looking cases."
"i simply took the wax stick out of its clear plastic packaging and put it into one of these, and presto, your favorite lippie has a new home!"
i have since ordered a few more of these cases to transfer the lipsticks out of their clear plastic drugstore cases and into a more glammed up stylish case.  
love em❤❤❤
this is the best long wearing lipstick i have ever used.  
i have dry lips and other long wearing products dry them out.  
this product lasts all day and the colors are wonderful.
i do actually wear this ring but not as a wedding band like i wanted to.
i order a size 5 and its really more of a small size 4.
i wear a size 5.5 but figured
i be safe since others have said this will strength out a bit.
"yes, it has done that"
and now it's a larger size 4....
not sure if i want to take the chance and order a larger size expecting it to fit....since others didn't seem to have the problem of the size being smaller.
i was looking for this color in doll 10 as a refill for a lipstick/gloss combo that i purchased elsewhere.  
so glad i could find it on amazon.  
i love this color--not too pink but gives color.
having searched locally for this particular color of lipstick by this manufacturer for some time i was delighted to find it so readily available on line.  
it is exactly what i wanted and so very easy to get.  
excellent product!
love the feel of this lipstick.  
i've been looking for a nice neutral color for so long and have bought so many lipsticks only to return them or throw them away.  
this one is fantastic.  
getting another one for my purse.
i really love the shade!
"it's a bit drying, but it's better than most liquid lipsticks."
the staying power is average; i reapplied after lunch because it faded around the inner lip by mu mouth.
"however, it stayed on through the morning's coffee and talking."
"wife loves it, her fav charger now !"
this is a great piece furniture.

a lipstick that is true to it's color.
very happy with it.
would buy it again.
will be one of my 2 staple lipsticks.
these lipstick colors are beautiful and my lips feel so soft after application.
"they have color chap stick feel, not a heavy or dry feel."
"love this ring, it replaced our weddingband..."
many at the job loose their finger due getting their ring stuck in stuff.
this makes sure u won't loose your finger.
so comfortable you don't even know you are wearing it.
"work beautifully with my tkb mold, for my lipsticks."
love everything about this product.
"the lip color case is so cute, complete with a little mirror."
"but the product itself, amazing!"
"i love the intital glossy look, and once the gloss wears off the lip color stains my lips for hours."
will buy again!
loved it
loved it
love it.
the lasting effect of this lipstick is what i love.  
the color is a bright fun color.
"great seller and great color, thank you!"
love this color!  
thank goodness
i can still get them on amazon.
arrived in perfect new condition.  
so happy.
only drugstore lipstick i can’t live without.  
discontinued at our ulta.  
perfect texture and nude to wear alone casually or over a vibrant color to nude it over  
there is no dupe for this super creamy perfection.
"while it’s not really long lasting, it’s still fabulous."
"look really nice for the prize, no one can tell they are cheap"
was a gift for my wife
and she loves it
fair price.
shipping isn't so fast tho.
five stars for the quality and look.
size did not fit but nothing to do with the quality of the product.
ok
"beautifull color, fast delivery"
"listing says 5 arrived with 6 , product is exactly as described."
didn't expect the quality i received considering the price.
very impressed.
easy to use
it's a perfect size and i like the color too.
it's works well with my phone.
this mulberry lipstick is one of my favorites.  
it goes with all skin and hair colors.  
it stays on a long time.  
i highly recommend it!
i love the rich color not stickygreat coverage
loved it!  
stayed on long time and color
was more natural looking!
can’t find them
love it
perfect nude
makes a charming little gift.
really cute!
love the wider band!
i've tried a couple other silicone brands but my actual wedding rings are wider so the thin bands were hard to get use to.
i wear a size 4-4.5
so the 5 is a tad big but not enough to bother me.
very comfortable.

was looking for something different and this was it.
must have product!
"use before applying mascara for thicker, longer lashes."
amazing!!!
absolutely perfect!  
i chose this one because it's flat and has the grooves for character.
doesn't look like i put a rubber washer on my finger
like i thought the other ones would.
very comfortable and true to size.
wet n wild silk finish dark wine  
is my favorite lipstick.  
i have ordered this product many times.
lipsticks are nice colors and full size.  
delivery was fast.  
very happy with purchase.
"no issues, wife loves that color, keep smiling!"
"i absolutely love this ring..sparkle,sparkle,sparkle!!!"
and it spins sparkle...
i'm so in love 😍😍
a very pleasant color that lasts better than my other brands.
she is  very  happy with her ring
and it is very comfortable and the camo design shows off well.
would recommend it highly.
i like the lip color alot!
love!
"for the price, they're too good"
perfect for lash cleaning
great color and moisture.
beautiful color
"it's red, just red!!"
awesome product!
it is true to size.
the ring is not bulky like other silicone rings.
it is a great purchase!
will be buying one for my husband soon.
favorite color
the picture on amazon didn't do it justice.
the color stays on.
it didn't crack or flake off.
i never noticed so many people look at my lips when i spoke before.
liquid lipsticks sure have revolutionized the world of lip color.
fits good
natural color
"for the price, it's great!"
"i bought the 3-pack and put 1 each atop a xmas gift for my daughters, the color is fabulous."

"i was looking for a good makeup brush holder and after buying a different one i didn’t like, i found a good deal on this one and purchased it."
"i really love it, fits a lot of different brushes, many of which are different sizes and thicknesses, everything from my eyeshadow brushes, eye liners, and my big brushes for blush."
"also, the brushes are easy to take out and put back in without getting stuck."
"and of course, it’s very sleek, sturdy and looks great."
i would highly recommend.
i love it!
i got this for a goddess deal on today's deals
but i would have paid full price.
this little holder holds everything from my hair brunch to a pair of tweezers.
the bottom has some weight
so it doesn't flip over.
i think they should make these in larger sizes.
"i'm new to exercising, still trying to figure out what works for me and whatnot."
these bands seem perfect for anyone!
"from beginners needing a low intensity band, to those more experienced and who can handle more of a resistance."
"the bands are lightweight, and really easy to use."
i've been using mine (the red one) for leg kicks while watching tv or waiting for the timer to go off.
"it's easy to move around (it's a band), and can be used for a variety of stretches."
"it's thick, well made, and does not look like it would snap easily."
i would recommend this product.**this product was bought with the intent to review afterwards.
i chose the red band.
i am just starting on my journey to better health and am not as strong as i used to be.
this is a great starter band.
it is well made and easy to grip.
i can take it with me to the park and easily use it to get in a mini workout while my son plays.
i wrap it around a bar and start stretching.
i do wish this had come with a bag to store and carry it in though.
i received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
i was a die hard mac girl for way too many years.
this is my new creme de nude.
this color is becoming more difficult to find.
i love it.
"lasts a long time, moisturizing and cheap!"
if you like a nude lip with a dark eye this is the color for you.
"works really well, even with thicker handled brushes."
"and the brushes weren't ""floppy"" in the holder and the bristles didn't get out of whack."
perfect brush storage.
"so i am in love with this product, i am an asian/hispanic woman and is very picky with lipstick shade."
"but oh , the #10, i fell in love with right away."
it suits my skin tone very well!
"i haven't tried the other shades yet, but will do later on!"
so stay tuned!
loved it!!
holds almost all of my brushes from small eyeliner ones to larger foundation ones...
also keeps them in place very tightly so their in it vert securely!!
def excellent product...
i have the black one.
resistance bands are great if you want to have the nice cut looking.
also it helps to go up in your bench press..
highly recommend it
perfect signature color
i love this product!!
came in so quick!!
the product smells like cake which i love
and it really does dry matte.
i received a colour from coloured raine's website that was the rockstar color
and it was terrible!!
it was patchy and when it dried it was blue with glitter??
which is not what i wanted at all!
but when this dried it is completely metallic and does not transfer!
this is a shade for all skin ​colors!
especially woc!!
a perfect bronze/brown metallic that everyone needs in their collection!!
so glad i found this.
love it.
i wanted to test them before i left a review.
i'm so happy with this purchase.
i leave these on all day
and i wear glasses.
they are so comfortable on my ears with my glasses too.
great sound and love the noise cancellation.
bought a pair for two relatives and they love their gift.
i bought an extra pair to switch when the other one needs charging.
i can watch tv or listen to music
and i don't have to disturb others.
if anyone has roku and the roku app on their phone with the headphones button on the roku app.
"just pair your headphones with bluetooth on your phone, open the roku app on your phone, tap on remote, tap on headphone icon and enjoy late night movies without disturbing others."
i don't even plug headphones into the roku remote anymore.  
you can watch any app you have downloaded on your roku and listen wireless with these headphones.  
the movie/show pauses when a call comes through.
if it's a short call it resumes and if it's a long call you may have to use the roku remote to resume play.
i workout with these headphones too.
so glad i don't have to keep pushing them in my ear or worry about them falling out.
i did not expect this from the price i paid for these headphones.
i may update this later in six months.
my dr wired headphones last for years.
this is my first pair of wireless bluetooth headphones.
hopefully these will last too.
"the idea that a bluetooth headphone offered really great sound and noise cancelling capabilities for just $20 usd was simply ridiculous a couple of years ago, i’m completely satisfied with this product, so far everything is great."
they are really comfortable; the design is so that sometimes you forget you are even wearing them.
it comes with 3 earbud sizes and finding the right fit is perhaps the most important task you need to accomplish if you wish to get your headphones full potential.  
an inappropriate fit will lessen the sound and noise cancelling features
but of course this in only logical.
"i’ve used them running, riding a bike and also while at office work.  "
"another great thing i didn’t except at all was the microphone quality, i don't like speaking loud when on a call, so far everyone listens to me just fine."
voice activating commands availability is great and also the possibility to pair a second device is nice.
so overall i’m pretty happy with this product
", i’m even giving them as presents to close friends this christmas."
update:
"so after posting the review below, i was contacted by their customer support."
they suggested that the pair i received may have had a manufacturing flaw and sent me a new pair free of charge after i had returned the original pair.
"i really didn't think it would change anything, but to my great surprise, they actually did fit into my ears and make a seal."
i did have to tilt them way up and work them in before moving the straps over my ears
so it takes a bit of maneuvering for me.
"giving them another test run, i found with the proper fit, the sound quality greatly improved."
"for my ears though, they still slip partially out when moving around and have to be adjusted frequently during workouts."
"the back of my ears get a bit sore after about 90 mins of use, due to the tension of the ear strap."
i still found the cord to look much more flimsy than in the picture.
"however, for the price, these things work pretty well."
"casually sitting at my desk, i don't have to adjust them quite as frequently, and the battery life is decent."
"in addition, i greatly appreciate the customer support.  "
for all those reasons i did increase my rating.  
"i'd say the new pair is about 3 stars, but the customer support raises it another 1 star for me."
original review
":i purchased several similar wireless headphones (details below) trying to find a pair that would stay in my ear, especially while running.  "
these have a weird design that doesn't allow the earbud to fit inside the ear to make a good seal.  
i tried all three sizes but the flat rounded part right before the tip prevents the earbud from getting into the ear and making a good seal.  
the sound quality is pretty poor without a good seal.  
"also, it's pretty infuriating that the cord does not look like the picture.  "
"instead of it being a nice looking straight band like shown, its all crumpled and wavy and looks terrible and cheap."
"out of the all the ones i tried (4 from amazon and the 2 from walmart): treblab j1 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b06zxr7646/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01__o00_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1fyi, other ones i tried on amazon:> villain wireless headphones - exact same issue.  "
"bad design, the flat round part that keeps the buds out of your ear canal."
>
phaiser
bhs-530 -
these are a little better.  
the make it part of the way in but still can't make a good seal because of
the design causes them to pivot and pop out of your ear as soon as you move.
"i initially wondered how good these wireless headphones can be considering the price point, but after using them for several weeks, i was amazed by the quality results these headphones deliver and how well they matched the description from the product page."
sound/audio:-
"after using it for several weeks and comparing it with some other wireless headphones, i think the audio and sound is one of the highest quality for bluetooth, wireless earbuds-"
"the bass is really good, and the stereo sound is amazing-"
"i really like the cvc noice cancelling feature,"
"when i'm in a noisy environment such as the train, these headphones do a really good job of blocking out the outside noise and allowing you to focus on the sound from the headphones- you can listen to these headphones from a good amount of distance from your devicedesign:-"
"the headphones fit very well in my ear and stay on very nicely even while i do activities such as working out at the gym, running, biking, etc.-"
they are very comfortable to wear-
i like how you can put them over your neck
so they don't come in the way-
"one feature that i would really love to see in the next version of this product are magnetic clips on the headphones so when they are over your shoulder, they can stick to each other making it easier to stay on your shouldersfunctionality-"
i love how quick and seamlessly the headphones connect to your device.
"since both pair of earbuds are wired to each other, there is no need for them to pair to each other; therefore, as soon as you turn them on, they pair automatically to your device very quick and easily-"
i like how you can control the volume of the sound from the top of the right earbud which is very convenient-
the battery life is amazing on these headphones.
i have been able to use these for the whole day without having to recharge them.
"sometimes when i don't use them heavily, they last several days without charge."
they battery
life for these is about 8 hours as listed on the product page which met my expectations for how long they will last with a single charge.
the charging time was also fairly quick for me to recharge the headphones.-
the earbuds worked really well with my iphone xs and also worked well with my mac and my windows 10
laptop-
they are also waterproof which is a big plus in case they accidentally fall in waterspecsbluetooth v4.1operating range:

", i think these wireless headphones are an amazing product for the price and really surpassed my expectations and doubts."
i bought these to wear when i go for walks and runs.
i wanted a inexpensive bluetooth ear bud that could get sweaty.
this is working great!!
i usually listen to an interval training app or a podcast.
the sound is great for that.
the noise canceling really works well.
so these would be even better for exercise in the gym.
"i have been leaving one bud out of my ear when outside, so i can still hear people approaching me on the trails."
i was using these while doing house work yesterday and i was able to answer my phone
and it paused my podcast.
"been using these headphones 4days now connected to my samsung phone with no problem and reconnected with my phone as soon i turn it on as long as my phone bluetooth is on ,made"
"well no problems so far ,sound quality is good"
"have used them while i'm working out,working in the yard and while i'm talking on the phone"
the person on the other end says it sounds clear and all controls work fine
", can't beat the price, will update the review if any problems but loving them right now holds charge been using the most of the days for long periods no problems"
i figured i would give a lengthy/in-depth review about these headphones.
"first, let me explain that i am a fairly active person"
and i am also a medical student on top of that
(this will be relevant later).
"i am going to break this down into five sections: connectivity, sound, running"
"/exercising, battery life, and controls."
connectivity:
i have an iphone and the headphones paired instantly.
"at first, i thought it was strange that they pair separately, but now i like it."
"if i want to put the left ear piece in and listen to lecture while jamming out, i can do so or vice versa."
sound:
"i have owned over the ear headphones, beats by dre, standard iphone ear pods, knock offs, etc."
"in my honest opinion, these compete with the best of them."
"they send you three different size earpieces (s,m, and l), and i found the medium is the best fit for myself and gives me the best bass/sound."
running
/exercising: i do insanity workouts (t25) and i also run.
"so, everything is high impact and quick paced."
"saying that, this is where my excitement for these headphones come in!"
"i purchased two different sets of headphones (these headphones) and a pair that are bluetooth, but they sort of hook over your ears."
"i tried them both out, and i eventually picked these over the “hooking” headphones."
"if you pick the correct earpiece (s,m, or l)"
they never fall out.
"battery life: it does have a fairly short battery life (around three hours), but if you carry the battery pack around with you, it can quadruple your battery for the headphones."
i pop these in during class lectures and listen to other material.
during lunch i will charge them and it carries me throughout the rest of the day.
"also, be sure to power them off when not in use."
controls:
"i’m used to basic headphones that do nothing, except allow you to listen to music."
"so, the fact that i can skip songs, and access siri with a touch of a button is nice."
"overall, i know this sounds like an infomercial, but i really enjoy the ease of these headphones."
"after seeing the wireless airpods, i knew it was only time until i wanted a pair."
"so, i researched what would best fit me and these took the"
cake.*if

install flash player i liked these ear buds so much that i have actually purchase a few pairs for family now.  
they seem sturdy;  they stay put in my ears even when i am pretty active.  
"more important to me, the sound quality is really great"
and i am hearing elements in music that i often don't hear or only normally hear with my $200 corded audiophile headset.  
that they can be purchased for under $100
makes them a great value.  
that they are closer to $25
makes them incredible!!

the nose cancellation is wonderfulsound quality is
perfectbattery life is greatsturdy...
great colors
my son has had 2 pairs of beats earphones that are super expensive said that these are even better than beats!
his beats didn't even last long so he is extremely happy with the super output and crisp sound he gets from betron.
the price is what really shocked him.
"well, my hubby was so impressed with them"
so i ordered another betron set for him too.
sometimes a brand is just a brand (beats) and is not worth the money you pay for.
"decided to try these instead of skullcandy, since i've been using the latter regularly for like 10 years and it seemed like time to try out something else."
"i have to say, no regrets."
"admittedly the gold color feels a little blingy, but the sound quality is better, the cables are more sturdy, and (while i recognize this may not be useful for everyone)"
the color makes them easier to find amidst the crowds of cables that live at home and at work for me.
hoping to use this brand for another 10 years for sure!
as a person who is very picky about their earbuds
i have a tough time finding what i want for the price i want to pay.
there are time when spending top dollar doesn’t always lead to top quality either.
with that said these earbuds offer a decent quality sound for a decent price.
also love how it functions with my iphone.
there are others out there who claim they’ll work with ios
but don’t.
only flaw i see in these earbuds is some more options for the earpieces like the cone shaped ones maybe.
apart from that they are great.
although the memory foam tips are more comfortable.
"first , the good things:1."
sound is decent for the price2.
remote works well3.
nice packagingnow here are the problems that ruin it for me:1.
the earbuds sizes are all too big.
even the smallest size offered is not that different from the medium and large sizes.
as a result they keep falling off my ears and never stay in place.
"that is also the case for the ""memory foam"" pair of earbuds."
"they are too big to begin with and after trying them out for 2 weeks, thinking they would shape nicely and become a snug fit, nothing."
"this rules out doing anything involving movement, even a light activity such as walking becomes problematic."
"since i listen to music a lot going to the gym or walking in general, it quickly becomes annoying.2."
i sometimes experience a disconnection while plugged in my smartphone.
this never happened to me with any other brand before.
"what i mean is that the earphones are plugged in, and all of a sudden the sound will stop coming from them, but from the phone's speaker, until i unplug/plug back in."
"i checked several times if it came from the phone or the connector, but i tried friends' ear/headphones, and didn't have any problem."
"i never heard of this brand until i researched ""best ear buds for the money"" online.  "
"after reading a nice write up on an independent site, i found these on sale at amazon and ordered them.  "
i've been using these for a few weeks now and can't recommend them highly enough.  
one can tell just by handling these that the quality is far superior than even more expensive ear buds; these are built to last.  
"the wires are tangle-free, they fit comfortably, and (most importantly)"
the sound is incredible.  
"given the price on amazon, you have nothing to lose and so much to gain by purchasing these.  "
do yourself a favor and get a pair!  
you'll be so glad you did.  
"after years of buying and using disposable ear buds, i've finally found my go-to brand.  "
"thank you, betron!"
best earbuds i ever purchased at this price point and possibly the best earbuds
i ever owned.
excellent sound quality.
"clear highs, nice mids, bass is surprisingly good as well."
"music sounds excellent as does spoken work like audio books, etc."
all three ranges are equally distributed.
i wouldn't add or subtract from any of the three.
they feel solidly build and the chord looks like it will not tangle easily.
the gold colored volume control/mic piece is place on the left side which makes reaching for it feel natural with my right hand.
most earbuds have the controller on right side and that makes for awkward reaching.
they fit very nicely in the ears and are very comfortable.
i think they will be good for work even for wearing them all day without discomfort.
they look cool too.
i really like the fact that the red ear bud has a red ring around it and the left has a black ring.
this will make it easy to know which is left/right.
they also have l and r on the earbuds.
overall a great buy.
i highly recommend this product.
great frequency response and bass is very clear.  
these are wayyyyyy better than beats and have a good build and sound
quality!p.s.
i am a student in high school and these noise isolating earbud help quite a bit.  
you can increase the volume a lot before it actually starts to leak out of the earbud itself.
don't write many product reviews buf have to o  
thjs one.
this replaced a much  more expensive set and i must say they are even better.
"great sound, just enough bass but not pounding."
great separation and most of all clear sound.
well constructed.
1year warranty.
just ordered another pair.
the worst headphones i've ever purchased.
i had them for maybe 3 days and used them while on the treadmill.
"they worked fine while walking, but the minute i would start running the volume would continually go down without me pressing the button on the headphone or on my actual phone."
"additionally, i was using them to listen to an online lecture for class and am pretty sure they shocked the inside of my ear."
i felt a sharp jolt around where the metal touched my ear.
at first i thought i might have just imagined it
but then it happened again.
i switched the earbuds around and noticed the same thing in my other ear.
do not buy these headphones unless you plan on using them while staying completely motionless and don't mind getting electrocuted every few minutes
best ten dollars i've ever spent in electronics.
i always hate when i get that new pair of earbuds+mic and within a day i can tell that the connection is shoddy and the wiring won't last.
"these headphones are not only not those headphones, they're downright good."
"and at ten dollars, i ordered two more pairs within a week of receiving the first."
"it's been a month now, and i have no complaints yet."
i use them for many hours each day and for all of my phone calls.
"decided to try these instead of skullcandy, since i've been using the latter regularly for like 10 years and it seemed like time to try out something else."
"i have to say, no regrets."
"admittedly the gold color feels a little blingy, but the sound quality is better, the cables are more sturdy, and (while i recognize this may not be useful for everyone)"

took while to arrive but i expected that.
perfect for what i needed it for.
"i have a snap on 18v cordless drill, i purchased new battery pack and was shipped right away to me and received it in a reasonable amount of time."
g/c has online instructions with step by step pictures on how to replace.
"replaced battery pack myself and it works like new, the originl batt."
"pack was years old and was shot now its like new, lots of power."
if you have questions you can call them.
you can send your old one to them and they will replace for you if you don't feel you can do it yourself.
half the price of buying a new batt.
pack from snap-on and just as much power.thanks g/c.........................

"these are thick steel sturdy signs, graphics and art is clear and crisp.  "

"does the job, appears well made and like the dual layer design.  "
"note these do not ""shorten"" at all when folded like"
most standard umbrella i'm used to (these are quite a bit longer due to the reverse closure...

"however obviously main point of the design is the reserve closure which is great when getting back in the car on a rainy day  haven't been able to test ""durability"" yet but will update review if it doesn't hold up well."
the bag is on the small side but that we pretty clear from the photos.
i haven't field tested it yet
but it appears to be very well made and sturdy with a variety of molle straps and clip on areas to add gear.
there is a y strap on the outside of the bag that works for strapping in a pair of shoes.
i'm using this as a get home bag to keep in my car
and it seems perfect.
there is a hidden compartment that sits against your back-
you could add a sheet of plastic or something in there to make the bag a little more structural.
"one thing to note about the description, it doesn't come with any other bags-"
it is just this little back pack.
see below.. not sure why they describe it this way.
'3
"molle bags included: with a detachable bug out bag that can be used as a waist, fanny or shoulder pack and two removable side packs, you get triple the options to configure for your mission."
'anyhow
i think for 16 bucks it is a stellar deal.
these handles are great!
"however, they are a little difficult to get."
i needed these for a project
so i ordered a pack.
they worked so well that i decided to buy more.
"unfortunately, they are no longer available through amazon."
"no problem, i went straight to the seller's website and placed the order."
that was two weeks ago
and i'm just now getting a shipping notification.
"still, they are nice enough to put up with the hassle."
"there are so many magnet ball/stick sets on amazon, and the cheap ones have bad reviews, weak magnets being the most common problem so that you can't build anything."
"i spent a lot of time reading reviews before buying this set, and i'm glad i did."
it works great.
"the magnets are strong enough to make 3 or 4-story structures, and the price is right."
"i bought another set, because we kept running out of pieces."
"my kids (ages 10-14) love these magnet toys, i keep them in the car"
so they stay entertained while we're on the road.
a good investment.
exceptional support and comfort..allows complete flexibility and you forget you even have it on....
i have tried many products but nothing has worked as well as this product even though i have paid 5 times the price for others ...
these one give great stabilite ...and its a really great product!!!!
i bought the shade warm ivory and its perfect for fair skin with a slight yellow undertone.
i am w2 in loreal true match for reference.
this foundation is very liquidy and is best applied with a brush or a wet sponge.
the finish is dewy.
i like how it looks on my skin and does not look like heavy makeup unless too much is applied.
"the smell is quite perfumey, so if you do not like strong scents, then this might not be for you although it did not bother my eyes."
i do have sensitive eyes and the strong smell did not bother them.
"very nice color, lots of space."
this is the 2nd bag from this mfg that i've bought -
the 1st one i had for 15 years and was quite similar to this one.
they last and the natural wear over time gives it the perfect lived-in look that i love.
i imagine this bag will last as long as the first
and i'll love it just as much.
this sheet set is awesome.
its comfortable and so cute.
i got it for my daughters big girl bed.
she has a very thick pillowtop mattress with an additional mattress topper on it as well.
the fitted sheet fit perfectly.
very deep pockets.
"they're perfect for the hot georgia summers we deal with, they're thin and cool but not see-thru"
and they don't feel cheap at all.
i'm very impressed.
and the price definitely couldn't be beat.
if they hadn't been sold out i would have bought several more.
i will be buying more if they ever come back in stock.
"(right) mj metals, 4mm, size 7, gold plated, tungsten carbide ring, engraving in ariel(left)"
"mj metals, 6mm, size 10.5, white, tungsten carbide ring---perfect!"
just what we wanted.
:)why pay $200-400 when you can get these beauties right here from mj metals??!
these are good quality with tons of creative potential for both kids and adults.  
"i did see a cautionary note about the magnets if the pieces are broken, but assuming appropriate care is taken, the set is reasonably priced and just plain neat."
"soft velvet small bags which i feel are very appropriate for return gifts, jewellery gifts, and could also be used as mini wallets and purses."
i got these in a light beige/cream.
just the right size for my return gifts.
lightweight and drawstring at the top.
reasonable price for a pack of twelve.
they are cream color even on the inside of the bags.
this is great training backpack for short day training.
it's the perfect size on the days that i dont have to bring a bunch of stuffs.
it's very light and seems can contain more items than i imagine with well organized pockets.
the sticking pad on the front can carry name tag and badges.
there's a layer inside of the backpack seems waterproof.
i had been looking for some more quality stone bracelets for moths now.
"i know there are many brands and styles out there, i even was going to make them myself"
so i could get exactly the style i wanted until i found these amorwing natural stone bracelets.
i absolutely love these brackets and will be placing a another order for more.
you will not be disappointed in quality of the bends used to make these or the product packaging amorwing unisex healing tiger eye onyx

great universal tablet case.  
"i use this on an rca viking 10.1"" tablet.  "
it fits securely and does not cover any of the ports.  
i would recommend this to anyone.

love these!  
a co-worker brought some back from london some time ago
and i've been hooked.  
"i would ask her to bring me a bag or two each time she visited london, but started feeling guilty.  "
"i had searched the internet for them earlier, but they weren't coming up.  "
am very happy i am now able to buy them.
the subject matter is awesome.
"the quality of the canvas, framing, and print quality was all excellent."
truly a pristine item.
i'd highly recommend buying this for any admirer of the genius of nikola tesla.
these things are great.
not too much light but
really a help in our closets.
no outlets in there.
my husband loves his new ring!
he lost the original one that was white gold which was way more expensive.
this ring is even shinier and doesn't scratch so far.
"great ring for the price, especially with engraving!update as of april 2018very satisfied with the company's customer service!"
we were issued a replacement ring because the first one broke when it was dropped.
the replacement ring somehow got lost in the mail.
"we informed the company, and they issued another replacement ring although it wasn't their fault!"
they went above and beyond our expectations.
i purchased this salt and pepper grinder set after looking through a lot of similar products.
the reason i chose this one is that it includes a couple of seasoning containers.
"the product looks really good, does not look cheap."
it is made of high quality class and can be washed in the washing machine.
i can also adjust the level of grind to grind the salt or pepper to my desired coarseness.
"also, i really like the seasoning container it comes with."
"the bottom of the container is magnetic, and so it can be attached refrigerator."
i can grind some seasoning and put them in the container for later use.
super convenient.
great item if you have limited space but want to have your phone where you can see it.
i tried several similar items for holding my phone while driving.  
one was the device you put into the cd slot.  
it worked ok but kept coming loose and
i had to re-set it.  
this one clips on the louvers of the vent without any trouble.  
the only down-side is that it tilts down the louvres due to the weight of the phone (iphone 7+).  
not a huge problem and not one caused by the device.  
i'm able to put my phone on the holder
and it stays put.  
i travel some rough dirt roads (washboard) and the phone stays where i put it.
"ever since i went to scotland last september, i am addicted to these butter mints."
i tried other brands over amazon and they went right in the trash.
these are very similar to marks and spencers.
this case feels heavy duty and provides protection all the way around the case but doesn't feel too bulky.
i normally don't like two piece phone cases but this one fits together seamlessly and looks just as nice as the expensive versions of this case.
would recommend!
i ordered these for my 2 bathrooms.
going to the bathroom at night you don't always want to put on the big light.
this has just enough light and goes on as soon as i enter the bathroom.  
the peel off sticky back did not stick to my wall
so i placed it upright on a stand.
i am still very happy to have this product.
these candies are delicious.
"i’m sad - they don’t actually contain bailey’s, which is always disappointing."
but that’s my fault for not reading the description.
chocolate with a baileys nougat center?
"uh, yes please."

i like it
the shelf looks great!  
i like that it is not a solid bottom- water does not sit in it.
my holy grail foundation!
it makes my skin look very natural.
however it has mediocre coverage that cannot be improved by building up.
"i do not mind this because my skin does not have noticeable pigmentation -  but for people with acne, this product might not be suitable."
great quality.
the back is a bit rubberized similar to the type the perfed shelf liners you might use in your kitchen for non-stick.
"i cut mine in 12"" squares as i will be using them under square vases as a centerpiece for an office event."
quick delivery!
cute case - lasted a long time before the design started to wear off.
looks higher end.
had it for a couple of months installed in the shower with hardware provided.
strong and sleek.
i wanted this cup so bad when it was available around december and was so sad
i didn't get it.
it came intact
but i noticed a little chip in the straw.
that's okay though as it still works just fine and looks amazing.
great sheets.  
so soft.
not hot very comfortable.  
would definitely buy again
i do not think they will be walking away it.
but as they say a lock only keeps an honest man honest.
worked first time!
a little work finding wires but comes with good instructions.
found out later that just holding the start button down for 3 seconds will unlock car.
really well made watch band.
my husband loves his nato bands.
good buy.
"for a short, sweet and lightly detailed review this earbuds company have outdone themselves!for a slightly longer one read on!"
i've only had it for a week
and i love them to death.
at work we have to use earplugs for our work environment is fairly loud.
"we are allowed to listen to music if we choose to, but in order to listen to music while we work, we would need to wear one ear bud and one ear plug."
"needless to say it's not the same as hearing music with both buds on, plus the noise in the background drowns out the music even if i play it on max volume because regular earbuds are not made to block out noise."
"then thanks to amazon, my curiosity and my love for supporting the underdog, i found these earbuds!"
little
did i know my purchase of these earbuds literally solved a longtime problem i never knew could be solved.
i no longer have to compromise protecting my hearing and enjoying my music i can do both at the same time with these earbuds!
"the memory foam blocks out the loud noise of our machines, i'd like to think, a little better than our ear protection provided to us."
the sound is amazing!
i downloaded an equalizer app on my phone to test the bass and it handled bass boost like a champ!
i got one of my coworkers to try it out just to make sure i was not being bias and
it got him truly shocked on how nice the bass sounds as well as the high and mids.
"i'm not an expert when it comes to sound, but if i had to compare these to all the earbuds i've bought from samsung bluetooths and dr. dre beats, stock ear buds and etc."
etc.
for this price this is worth
every penny and then some!
comes with plenty of extra as you can find on other reviews.
"if you plan on gaming with these, i can play overwatch for long periods of time without any discomfort."
sound is clear in game and mic sound is good according to my teammates.
just need to use the clip provided to keep the mic close to your head and not dropping around your neck or else
your comms will be faintly heard by your teammates.5 stars all around
"and i only put 4 on sound quality, because i would want to encourage them to continue to improve their product and amaze us with more bass without having the need to use an equalizer app."
that would be my one and only small critique of the product.
keep up the good work guys!
ok.
i’m not going to lie.
i’m very picky about my ear buds.
i have spent $100 on bassbuds that i assumed couldn’t be duplicated.
i was wrong.
these are amazing.
"they come with numerous memory foam options for all ear sizes, clip, adapter, they cancel noise and the bass is awesome."
"the ear buds are magnetic, so they stick together to prevent tangling."
"best of all, the price!"
i’m honestly in shock about how high the quality is for how little you pay.
no more bassbuds for me.
"i used the audio tone test utility on spotify to confirm that left and right labels are assigned to the *correct* audio channels on the buds i received today, so that defect (reported by some other reviewers here) seems to have been corrected.  "
"i have an lg v20, known for its audio quality, and these phones sound great on it using spotify's extreme quality resolution.  "
"i used the largest of the four sets of memory foam buds provided, and they were perfect for my large-ish ear openings.  "
"a really nice seal was obtained, and they stay in not only because of the foam but also because they are low-weight plugs that don't pull much in the first place.  "
a cable was supplied that will allow you to plug two separate plugs into a pc: one for sound out and one for microphone in.  
all for under $20 - i'm thrilled with these and am about to buy another set right now for my girlfriend.
1 month of use so far without problems.
will edit more after 2 months and so on.
when buying this i wanted the cheapest solution to talking on discord with my friends on pc.worked
right out of the round tin can
"(surprisingly unique packaging, i like it).minimal tangle problems considering how long it is (designed to plug into a pc while gaming)the microphone sounds better"
"when it’s closer to your mouth, a hefty con but considering the price it’s not so bad at all."
"my only requirements are that it sounds clear and direct, not muffled and in a bathroom, and it met all of that."
the given red memory-foam plugs showed signs of dirtyness very quickly.
hard to rub off as well.
"but, fits very well for my big ear holes and handles noise cancelling excellently."
just be careful when you watch unmentionables with these on.
"and considering noise cancelling, the earbuds handle bass levels very well compared to my last pair, very deep and grungy, not muffled and weak at all."
"i can actually hear many things that i haven’t heard before in my old songs, if you should ask about sound quality."
holds up very well for the price.
"overall, 9/10, 1 point off for the mic."
these are awesome earbuds.  
they come packaged in
"a tin can, along with 3 different sizes of foam ear pieces, and 3 different sizes of rubber ear pieces.  "
i'm not looking for or expecting bose quality in an earbud purchase but the sound quality in these is very good for my purposes.  
"i love that the ear parts have magnets in them to help them stick together, which really does help cut down on the amount of tangling that occurs."
"and i also love that when you plug them into your phone or device, that they don't stick straight out - they are an ""l"" shape, which protects the wire much better than a straight design.  "
the volume control on these
", i think is a bit of over kill since you can control volume on your device, but perhaps some will find it to be a nice convenience.  "
the final thing that made me decide to make this purchase was the five year guarantee...and the under $20 price tag.  
i would definitely purchase these again.
"i've only had these for a few days, so i might edit this later if anything comes up."
pros:-
"it arrived promptly, just 2 days after ordering-"
"it came with and does everything i expected it to, packaged"
neatly-
the memory foam tips block out most of the outside noises and fits to your ear-
"soft carrying pouch, so soft that i fell asleep while holding it-"
"the jack doesn't stick straight out and can face different angles, so you can be in different positions from the audio port without wearing down the cable-"
"there's a splitter which i don't need, but it's nice that it has been provided in case"
i did/do need it-
decent sound quality- decent mic quality (roughly the same/better than the apple earpods from what my friends have told me on discord)-
"they're magnetic so it doesn't tangle as easily- 5 year warranty, and they seem to have good customer servicecons:-"
the cord is a bit long.
"i guess this could be a pro depending on what your purposes are, but since i use them on mobile most of the time, it's a little annoying."
"you can't eat your cake and have it too, though."
(suggestion:
a cord winder on future products?
"obviously i don't know the logistics of it.. if it can be viable, fashionable, etc."
but that's my two cents.)-
the mic hangs a bit low (but it's easily fixed with the clip that is provided)-
the ear extensions get dirty fairly easily.
maybe i need to clean my ears.-
"i can't seem to figure out how to use the volume control, though the pause/play, answer call, and mute sound functions workoverall:-"
quality product with extra commodities for good price-
"does what i need it for (calls, gaming, listening to music/podcasts)"
"been using these for 6 months now, no problems with the wiring getting screwed up or sound cutting in and out"
like ive had in the past with brand name headphones
"(skull candy, sony) use them for everything from working out at the gym, drowning out the mower or trimmer during yard work, phone calls, even works great on my computer."
2 weeks ago one of the ear tips broke and
the replacements that came with it didn't fit my ears right and made the ear bud keep falling out of my ear which made me not want to use them for anything.
contacted the seller with my dilemma they told me they do sell replacement tips but couldn't get them to my location.
instead offered to send me a replacement for them.
came today with a thank you for being a customer.
definitely would recommend these.
if any issues arise i will reach out to them again and update this review.
this is the first pair of corded earbuds i've owned in a while.
"wireless earbuds bring about too many technical issues, and you don't have to worry about charging these."
i really like these specifically for a few reasons.
the design for the actual plug in is the smartest i've ever seen.
"issues with wires always start at the base, right where it plugs in, due to relentless twisting and bending."
"this little piece becomes ultra resistant to both because of its design, ensuring this will last very long."
the mic/volume control is really nice and these have an adjustable clip that can go anywhere along the cord
so you can best position the mic.
the best part about this though is the volume control being on a sliding button rather than individual up and down buttons.
this means you can check before putting in your earbuds to make sure it's at the appropriate volume.
no blasting your eardrums or having to button mash the up arrow at the start.
probably the most important is the sound itself
(note that i'm not particularly an audiophile).
i really like the crisp sound and clear treble.
"there is bass present, especially when local settings are maximized and when sound is turned up."
i wouldn't describe the bass as 'heavy' but it is very well-balanced.
and i wanted to also mention i really like
the case(s) offered - both a tin and a soft/thick mesh
pouch - as well as the earpiece options of both foam and rubber in varying sizes (and even a red foam set
", rest are black).the"
"only thing i would suggest is an additional clip to manage the long cable length when storing to prevent tangling, but alas"
that's the reality of corded earplugs.
switched from wireless headset to earbuds and a yeti microphone for pc gaming.
headset just to annoying after an hour or so.
did my research on earbuds and these kept popping up as highly rated.
for the price if they were crap i would just replace them.
i was more than surprised by everything about them.
"packaging was top notch, cable quality"
"good, earbuds themselves look to be well made."
sound is great!
i do loose what i feel is a little bit of fullness of sound versus a good gaming headset
but not enough to make me go back.
the earbuds themselves are fairly long and really heavy compared to most i have tried.
once you pick the right size earpiece though they do not fell overly bulky in your ears.
i do loop the cable over the ears to ensure they stay in place
but do not think this is a requirement unless you were doing heavy exercise.
"lots of bass, no loss of highs."
sound easily equals wired earbuds costing $100.
sound is much better than apples airpods.  
"i have tried with phone, pc and on airplane entertainment system and all delivered excellent sound."
i do not write many reviews but these deserved a thumbs up!
i love my new k l i m fusion earbuds!
i normally use the original samsung earbuds that come with the phone or
most recently i bought a pair of beats earbuds.
both of these earbuds are expensive when i need to replace them
i was looking for an alternative when i ran across klim fusion.
the best part is the memory foam earbud covers
so they stay in my ears which is often a challenge because i have small ears...
the buds are normally too big and fall out but these stay in.
the wire is longer than most earbuds i've had in the past which makes it convenient to set my phone down and still stay connected.
i also like that the buds are magnetic
so when i'm not using them they stick together.
i also like the small net pouch they came with them
so i can keep them safe when not in use.
i get good call quality
my callers can hear me clearly on the other end and i can hear well.
i refuse to speak on the phone without earbuds
so it was a pleasant surprised to receive these that works so well and we're affordable!
ok.
i’m not going to lie.
i’m very picky about my ear buds.
i have spent $100 on bassbuds that i assumed couldn’t be duplicated.
i was wrong.
these are amazing.
"they come with numerous memory foam options for all ear sizes, clip, adapter, they cancel noise and the bass is awesome."
"the ear buds are magnetic, so they stick together to prevent tangling."
"best of all, the price!"
i’m honestly in shock about how high the quality is for how little you pay.
no more bassbuds for me.
i admit i usually buy really cheap earbuds and then move them to backups when one side inevitably fails.
i'm listening to audiobooks
"so sound quality isn't crucial, but i also use them for business calls and the mics can be an issue."
not with this set.
"they're incredibly well made, high quality"
and they feel like they'll last forever.
"if that proves not true, i'm buying them again because they're a really good set."
i love having an inline volume control and the carrying bag
is a nice plus too.
"get them, you'll be pleased."
these have great sounds quality for the price point.
bought these for commuting on a train daily and after having them for a week
i'm really impressed.
they are well balanced for good sound regardless of the type of music/radio/
podcast you're listening to.
i listen to a lot of podcasts which is why i got these
but i found myself wanting to listen to music more just because these have such a good sound.
for the price point they do an excellent job.
i swapped in some foam and it lowered em a bit.
good for planes but not good enough to block out loud talkers behind you.
slightly muted sounding and a little bass heavy but good overall!
"so i got these earbuds on monday, since my other ones were cutting out and were old."
"i love the sound quality on these earbuds, but i have come across a couple problems."
"the first problem is that it is a little difficult swapping out the little earbud pieces that are provided because when you try to put another earbud piece in, it will fall out."
i have to put the pieces inside out in order for me to put them on properly.
the other problem i’ve been having is that the buttons do not work at all.
i like to listen to music while i’m at work
"and if i try to pause my music with the middle button on the remote part of the earbuds, it does not pause"
so i have to take out my phone and pause my song.
"overall i love these earbuds, but these two problems are the reasons why i’m giving it a 4 star."
first thing i noticed about these was they had so many different ear plugs options.
extras and different sizes.
"very comfortable, good cord length."
comes with a nice carrying pouch.
i like the controls on the cord to make it easier to stop/pause/change volume.
they give great sound quality
oh much better.
last set was messed up
some how.
got replacement set and works much better.
enjoying how well they block sound and the subwoofer effect i hear now.
"these are a nice, inexpensive pair of wired earbuds."
i like that there is a control on the cord to adjust the volume or skip to the next song.
it was easy for me to get a good fit with the selection of 5 in ear cushions of different sizes.
"these earbuds have good sound quality, nice noise isolation and bass!"
"okay, i get it"
"these are budget earbuds, but please do not false advertise the product."
"noise cancellation is above average, but these things have no bass."
i had not understood the production over view.
"i was under the impression that  there was a volume control for the earphone that you can adjust, but found later that it was a control for the telephone connection."
i did not purchase them for a telephone connection.
my lost!
i like that these have several options of sizes for the ear bud part.
makes them easily comfortable.
they also have a nice length to the cord.
the sound quality is great for watching  shows on a tablet or playing games on my phone.
good quality just what i needed.
these have great sounds quality for the price point.
bought these for commuting on a train daily and after having them for a week
i'm really impressed.

purchased for cell phone.
works as advertised.
"quality build, comfortable ear buds and great sound quality."
possibly it's my phone.  
have to hold mike up to my mouth.  
"otherwise, they're fine."
i can hear when driving
"sometimes they work great, other times they cut out a lot"
and i can't understand the person i'm talking with.
they work great!
works great with my motorola phone.
works great with my motorola phone.
the sound quality is very good for the price
i like the sound quality and i allso like how i can connect this to my xbox one controller.
great value for the money
", i don't utilize the mic but for pc or phone"
they are great headphones.
great - use it at planet fitness all the time
they are loud enough
"i ordered these for my son to motivate him to get active, and since he was always complaining about hearing some nearby construction i figured these would be a good choice."
it didn't get him active
"(not even a miracle worker could do that), so i took them and absolutely love them!"
i can't even here
the wifey when she needs me to move furniture.
"my daughter, o destroyer of earbuds, took down another pair, and i mean shredded them."
so i bought these thinking there were cheap enough to last me till i could buy a decent pair.
but these are actually really good!
"little carry bag was very handy too, my daughter doesn't recognize it and isn't interested in them because they don't have a zipper case like a lot of them do."
"very good sound quality though, will definitely buy another pair if my daughter destroys these eventually."
lol.
these have great sound.
i also can't hear anything besides the music which is great.
i wear at night as well to drown out the sound of my husbands snoring.
i can't hear him anymore
i love these earbuds.
"the wire is a great length, long enough to not be restrictive, easily plenty of length to use in a backpack."
sound quality is great.
very good dynamic range.
"these are a nice option if you don't care for the wireless headphones, like myself.  "
i use these with my kindle when i listen to audio books and its sound is perfect.
my students in my class love these!
they are comfortable and stylish.
the sound quality is amazing.
no static and the bass is crisp and smooth.
the sound quality is good.
the only issue i have is that the earphones are shaped round edges and so it falls off your ears when you move around wearing them.
"only use if you’re alone, or warm someone before you put them in at home because once you have them in, you’re dead to the world."
these are very nice ear buds.  
they were exactly what i anticipated when i ordered.  
they work great and the sound is awesome
my new favorite ear buds!
perfect comfy fit
and they work amazingly in noisy places.
definitely hiding these from the kids!!
perfect for sleeping while my husband is snoring!
comfortable and great at blocking out noise.
these earbuds work surprisingly well considering how inexpensive they are.
great buy.
it's a cute little dress but not as long as i had hoped.
i'm a short fat elderly grandmother and don't like to show much above my ankles.
"it is just like a t-shirt, very comfortable but too casual for work."
(i'm a paralegal.)
it would be more suitable for a younger (and thinner) person.
i would have given the product itself 3 stars.
however i subtracted one star because of the marketing for 2 reasons.
1)
many of the reviews are not for this product.
this is very confusing 2)
"the product has samsung stamped on it, and i'm pretty sure it's not samsung."

"these don't feel like cheap earphones at all, they're legit samsung earphones!"
i haven't had any problems with them and they still sound great.
luckily i got what i payed for cause the reviews didn't match the product whatsoever
"i purchased a two pack of earbuds for $8.99, but most of the reviews are not for this product."
i wish i had realized this before purchasing the product.
the earbuds do not work unless the wire is facing a certain angle.
extremely annoying.
i do not recommend this product to anyone.
my set of samsung earbuds broke after over a year of service.
i couldn't find official replacements here on amazon
"so i bought these and to my surprise, they had the samsung logo on them."
"after closer inspection, i noticed a variety of small (unnoticeable unless you look for them)"
"differences between my samsung buds that broke and these, so either samsung changed the design slightly (unlikely)"
", outsources to different factories that use slightly different methods (more likely), or these are bootlegs (most likely).ordinarily i wouldn't care, but they have been pausing songs and bringing up voice control as if i had touched one of the buttons without me touching any buttons, if the cable is moved a bit."
it happens just often enough to be a nuisance.
"i ""fixed"" this by putting a bit of clear tape around the bottom white ring on the jack (furthest from the point), but this disables the controls altogether.2 stars instead of 1 because it works for the main purpose i bought them"
", i probably won't buy new earbuds until these break."
if they break too soon i'll update the rating.
i am a medical student
so i wanted something affordable and accurate.
this skull is very accurate and the case is very useful when going back and flrth from the lab and home.
it contains all the foramen and processes and it has a good anatomical proportion.
the reason i give it four stars instead of five:-there are some dark smudges from the ink on skull.
probably from writing the numbers.-the upper part of the cranium does not attach evenly but it closes fine.-cranium cap
id a darker color that the rest of skull.
other than this i feel it is a great investment for the price offered since usually these can go for 50$ and dont include a carrying case.
i have not checked if labels are correct.
"i dont use the labels since i use the book for reference, not the list."
the book says its accurate though.
i am actually very excited for this item and have promptly named him barry.
posted pics of barry.
i didn't feel comfortable when i saw the price cuz
most of the scientific skulls are expensive but i bought it any ways.
here is my review from me being a medical student:1-
"the skull is not perfectly made, the plastic on the cup has some brown stains like it was over baked.2-"
the numbers are hand written and the ink goes off with time.3-
the numbers are not clear sometimes as they are hand written as i seid.4-the skull isn't anatomically correct!
some groves are not there also
some nerve notches are not there or are a small holes  instead of a side to side hole they are only a small grove which is wrong! some.5-
the one i got has an extra tooth on the upper left maxilla???
why??!!6- the string that links the mandible to the palate to make the mandible attached to the skull is non detectable so basically you can't have an inferior clear view of the model.7-
many small details are missed like the architecture of the inner of the mandible is missed so on the most of the skulls surface which are flat basically.8-
"not everything is listed in the card, lots of important structures are not identified .for"
me
it was a big waste of money
cuz
i really needed it for my studies
and i had some exams i needed that skull for plus
i moved to another country so returning the model is impossible.to be fair here
are some things i like about this model
:the bag is a good idea and
"the green things really helps and they hava a caring support team who sent me 2 messages to ask me about their product.bottom line if you are a medical student looking for a detailed skull this one won't help you out instead try to invest in a higher end model it would save you time and money, and if you are getting this for other studies reason or for a decoration purpose this one is for you."
finally!!!
!
"finally i receive an article of clothing, made of good quality material, that fits exactly"
like i wanted it to.
not only is it comfortable but it looks great & makes me look great.
"i'm 5'1"" 140 pounds & i ordered the xl as i have a bit of stomach pooch that i'm very self conscience about."
this shirt hides it perfectly without it looking like i'm purposely trying to hide an unflattering body part.
"i also often worry about the crotch area of jeans & things that i wear & this covers/hides this area perfectly too, also without looking like you're purposely trying to hide something."
"it fits loose enough to be comfortable without looking baggy or that it's ""too big for you"", but at the same time fitting ""just right"" enough that you don't look like you've stuffed yourself into something too small for you."
the quality of the material is perfect.
it's just right in that it's thin enough
so as not to be the heaviness of a heavy sweatshirt & you could choose to wear a tank top under it if you wanted too but also just right in thick enough that you don't have to wear a tank top under it if you don't want to
and you'd still be just fine without feeling uncomfortable and or too chilly.
i love it so much
i just went back on the website & bought it in the other colors they have.
it's rare for me to find clothing that is all of the above
so when something is really really good i like to have more of it
& i want to let others know because shopping online is such a gamble in what you're getting.
"if they had this in more colors, i'd buy more."
you won't be disappointed.
"after about a week of use, i can say i've found the right pillow for me!a few years"
a go
i tried an expensive memory foam contour pillow.
after only two nights my neck was in so much pain
i had to seek chiropractic help.
i knew it was the pillow and the chiropractor
couldn't disagree with the diagnosis.
his recommendation: try latex.
i shopped at my local department store and found my first latex pillow.
"for a long time i slept well, but not great."
"the pillow was rather thick and the latex was rather ""springy""."
"i always felt my head was a little high and at night i would always ""tuck"" some of the pillow under my neck for added support."
there had to be a better alternative.
"after searching the numerous options, i decided on the snull pillow with a contour shape."
"after removing it from the vacuum bag i let it sit for a few days to ""fluff"" up and air out."
in this time i ran the cases through the wash as they had taken up the latex scent from prolonged exposure.
it's proven to be the best sleep decision i've ever made.
in just one night i felt the difference.
i woke up to find that i literally felt better.
i felt more rested and less strained.
a few more nights
and i noticed that i was falling asleep easier as well.
i use the shorter contoured side of the pillow as that's just enough support for my neck.
the center concave is just shallow enough that my head rests more naturally in line with my spine (i'm a side sleeper).
the firmness is just right and it stays at a comfortable temperature.
"i'm a ""warm body"" and that was one thing that i was told that made the memory foam a bad option for me."
"the heat from my head would soak into the memory foam, making it feel warmer and as a result, causing it to become more malleable, allowing my head to sink too low the longer i slept on it."
i've already recommended this pillow to family and friends.
"i know it might not be the best option for others, but for the price it's worth a try."
i am definitely glad i bought one!
we did a budget remodel of our guest bathroom and couldn't believe how inexpensive this sink was.
it's great quality and was easy to install.
we're very happy with the look and have been using it for a few months now.
i would purchase this again in a heartbeat!
i would have given the product itself 3 stars.
however i subtracted one star because of the marketing for 2 reasons.
1)
many of the reviews are not for this product.
this is very confusing 2)

"arrived on time, and works"
i love the sound of the glass when it gets pinged by a toothpaste tube.
looks lovely and unique.
"nice with wall-mount faucets, which we positioned to fall directly over the drain cover."
"still working on the walls and counter, but i included photos."
"i have to say i really love these dice and the other metal sets i've purchased, my only complaint would be the very high price tag on the sets i've payed for."
"i do however understand where the cost comes from, seeing as they're solid metal dice, i assume machining metal dice is a lot more expensive that casting massive batches of plastic dice!i can't very well say if they're balanced dice because no matter what dice i roll i always tend to roll very low (both my dice and friends"
so maybe i just suck at rolling haha)
but every so often these pull through
and i'll land that much needed critical hit after a string of several misses!
the pillow is very comfortable with just the right amount of softness and support for the neck.
"however, it doesn't seem as high as described, so i had to return it.  "
"at it's current height, it seems it would be great for back sleepers and side sleepers who don't require a high loft.  "
"if i was a back sleeper,  i would have kept it."
"it does have a slight smell, but it wasn't that strong to me."
i simply washed both cases and found the smell wasn't that noticable with time.
it seems to be made well.
i'd recommend it to others.
super cute!
my 11 month old wore this to comic con last weekend.
also i love that the cape was detachable.
"the cape is super cute, but we wanted to be true to wonder woman since she doesn't wear a cape."
also the skirt is short enough that it doesn't get in the way of crawling -
my baby gets so mad when anything impedes her super fast crawling.
the size seems to run a little small though.
"she is petite and wears 9 month onesies and can still fit into her 6 month onesies, but the 9-12 month size was almost too small in length."
"all in all, very happy with this outfit!"
beautiful!!
absolutely recommended to anyone whos looking for quality rosaries.
color weight and length are just right.
great for gifts too
i gave two to family and kept one for myself.
a great find and an even better price!
love this purse!
it is the perfect size!
"i love it so much that i have not been able to convince myself to go back to my expensive, heavy, designer bag and wallet set."
"unfortunately, it has started to fray around the zipper on the back pouch."
"this is a zipper i rarely open and close, so the fraying is caused by my cell phone going in and out."
"i have purchased several travelon purses in the past, and this is by far my favorite, but the quality is not as good as in the past."
i will gladly pay for better quality.
only four stars on looks right now the hello translated in 10 different languages is absolutely adorable i will be back for the one up or down
depends on tomorrow's laundry day...
i always wash items before i use them on babygirl
so tomorrow i'll update the results....
pretty cheap item compared to others sold for mattress pads...praying for good results'''ok as with all purchased items i washed the mattress pads and dried the pads on gentle
", they turned out great and not frayed or stretched out..."
i would really suggest that when you wash your mattress pads to wash and dry on the gentle cycle to achieve no heart breaks or money loss as with some pads...
i got this for my mother.  
"she really wanted the purple one, so we waited for it to be shipped from china.  "
"the shipping speed was pretty accurate, but it still took a long time.  "
i suppose shipping from china does take awhile.  
"the color is spot on, and a super cute purple.  "
my mom loves it
", i cannot really comment on the quaility of the protection at this point because it is not on my personal phone, but it seems like it would protect as well as any other case i have seem.  "
one con
"i see is that the purple part comes away from the main part of the case, and this seems a little weird to me."
this dress is gorgeous and very flattering for someone with curves.  
if you are short like me (5'3) then it is pretty long and you may need to get it hemmed.  
i am a size 16 (about 210 lbs) and ordered an extra-large.  
"it fits quite well, even over my chest, which is very large (size 38 g).  "
definitely recommend.
i got a medium and it fits perfect.
i usually wear an xl in womens stuff.
"i am 5'4"" and the length is perfect."
i read other reviews before i ordered.
i love the soft and warm fleece and the quality workmanship.
the bees face is super cool.
just wish the stinger wasn't so low and sewn on the black part
so you can't really see it.
the wings are cute.
perfect for cold eve/mornings.
this company is awesome!
in all honesty i would give no stars if i could.
it’s a 2 pack and both sets were broken within the first use.
one completely detached from the mic and the other would not plug into the phone.
this item came directly from china and it arrived on time
but most of all it fit my vintage nikon
telephoto lens.
it is the perfect replacement to the collapsible rubber lens hood that was deteriorating because of age.
"even though it does not fold down like my older lens hood (because it is made of metal), that was the reason i purchased it in the first place."
the metal lens hood adds protection to the front of the lens when you are trekking through the woods.
all in all i think this hood is well made and does exactly what i purchased it for.
"super cute, but a bit big."
"i sized up after reading the comments, but i wished i hadn't."
just a heads up!
"besides that, super cute and comfy."
i can't wait to wear this when it gets sunny out!
"overall, for the money, this is a really good representation of the human skull with most features marked.  "
i would have to say my biggest complaint is the fact that the numbers that they put on to mark stuff rubs off quite easily with minor handling

a good cable for charging.
it saves phone of being introduced and removed from the microusb charger connector preventing the slot from dust and dirt .once inserted the microusb connector on the phone barely stands out.
"very handy in low light or in the car, which is always difficult to figure out if you're getting right or upside down, as it works in both positions."
"the strength of the magnet is perfect, it sets out alone and it can't be disconnected by involuntary movements."
the charging speed is the same as with the original telephone cable.
"it can also be used as data cable to connect your phone to your pc.the cable is 120cm length, very strong and is not easy to be bundled."
it has a blue led on the connector lights up when charging.
"the only drawback i find is that only comes with one connector, and if you have multiple phones it only can be used for one."
"a good product, very comfortable and recommended"
i received these beauties in 3 days of ordering.
"first, they are very inexpensive which i appreciate."
these earrings are as beautiful going as they are coming.
"i like putting my hair up, and these are so pretty from the back."
they look like dangling diamonds.
i love that the french hooks are shorter.
"so elegant, yet they would look great with jeans."
"i had another pair of earrings picked out to wear to my mom's funeral, but decided these would be perfect for the occasion."
very pleased with my purchase.
absolutely loved this for my daughter.  
i had her wear it for her very first comic con &
sure enough she got many compliments on her outfit!
"these say samsung on the earbuds, but it is obvious they are knockoffs.  "
"sound quality is low, tactile feel of the buttons is garbage, volume up only works if pressed very hard."
these clips are a great alternative to using pins when working on a sewing project!
i find myself grabbing for these instead of pins on most projects now and will be ordering another set as i have lent my niece a large portion of these and suspect i wont be getting them back.
"the clips have a pretty wide opening, i could clip several layers of medium weight fabric and they have a good gripping power to hold onto the layers while you sew up to them."
so cute and soft!
we used these as easter egg fillers for my 1-year-old nieces' first egg hunt.
"keep an eye out for better deals from other amazon sellers, i found this set of 16 for significantly less than what i paid"
but i was in a rush and
the better priced ones wouldn't have arrived in time.
"holds all my cards, and the magnet is a life saver."
"i love that you can remove the phone when you need to, and the case with the magnet is awesome."
i've used it to stick it to the fridge so i can listen to music while i bake and won't get crud on my phone.
"very well made, great price."
well i love it.
"it's super light weight, and easy to use.  "
it's pretty bright.
i  use it in areas where my lighting is not working properly in the basement.
"my 6 year old has stolen mine, so i had to buy another one."
she uses it as a night light.
"the power button,  and the dimming arrows are really sensitive.  "
a light tap
and it will either alter the  desired setting or power it off.
"it's real easy to grab it, and your hand will accidentally touch the buttons."
"overall, i  am a fan."
just got to remember to keep my hands away from the buttons.
not as good as the oem style
", these feel a little larger in the ear, only come with 1 tip"
"size.the bass is lacking, but for the price i can't complain too much"
redemption cemetery 2 was everything i expected and more!
"the graphics, story plot, illustrations, and the hidden object scenes were all superb."
redemption cemetery 1 and 2 have created an excellent brand method of enjoying hidden object games.
i am in great anticipation of redemption cemetery 3; if there is one coming and i truly hope so!
i would recommend this game and purchasing this product from this seller for excellent game play and service.
i truly enjoyed this game.
"i received this product quicker than i anticipated, and believe me this is a good thing!"
thanks amazon!
complete rip off got both pairs and only one side worked on either
and they sound terrible
i guess i got one working pair that i can't use together because they're separate head sets
i bought these earphones in a 2-pack.
they are well built and pretty comfortable in the ear.
"however the clarity is not the best, and the volume is not even for both ears."
i tried adjusting the position in my ear.
nothing i did improved these problems.
at times there's also static when you touch the jack connection area.
"not worth the money, even for so cheap!"
the case is what is advertised.
what i wasn't expecting is that it is stiffer than the leather version of these cases.  
that has been a bit of adjustment.  
i would recommend the case
but if you expect it to be like soft leather its not.  
but it is beautiful and look exactly like it is advertised.  
the magnet works well and i will never go back to a regular phone case.
amazing
this is a great tool to use for anatomy class.
my daughter and i both used this to study for our exam on the skull and we both got an a!
it's a great price and comes with a carrying case for portability.
love the pipe cleaners to help view the cranial pathways.
we both agreed that this definitely helped us learn!
"be a little careful when handling, as the some numbers tend to smudge after awhile, but it did not change our learning experience at all!"
"i thought about using some clear nail polish to help set the ink, but i never did."
it's really not a big deal.
thanks geekidoc!
please make more anatomy models!
she said she easily sleeps with this pillow bc
this is rubber materials compared to the cotton one.
"one star i deduct since when i try using this and turn my head to either sides, i can smell the rubber."
"overall, 4 stars bc"
my mom likes it.
"very happy with my purchase, so much so that i ordered two more in red, one for myself and one for my sister."
"the quality and workmanship are outstanding,very well put toghther large and very roomy."
"the leather is of excellent guality very nice to the touch, the smell is like walking into a very high end  "
"leather goods shop( like in europe,shoes and handbags)"
my sister has a samsung galaxy and it fit in compart like a glove; she was very surprized to see that she could put her phone in and go without out needing to take her purse.
the best purchase for the best price ever.
you won`t be disappointed.
oh by the way the snap closure points up not down which is nice because it won`t get mangled in your handbag and it has a slit pocket on the back.
awesome purchase!
never had to return so many ear phones.
my callers couldn't hear me and it sounded like i was under water.
attracted to the price...
"first two sinks arrived together, for master bath renovation, packed well, but both slightly different in color."
"one had what appeared to be a red stain where they drilled the drain hole, but for the price, minor differences were expected."
"however, one sink was also visibly misshapen on the edge of the bowl.  "
"the replacement was made quickly and without problem, however, when the replacement sink arrived it was a different tone than the other, and looks slightly smaller in size and clearly more white.  "
i'm not too dissatisfied
", i think i got what i paid for."
really bad quality.
everytime i use it
i can't hesr anything
plus there is a static noise
when i can.
very disapointed.
love how it fits easily into my son's hand.  
he can use it in 1 hand during his classes at school & still be able to write with his other hand.  
there are 7 different gadgets on this to play with - the more outlet options the better with adhd!
i added a longer strap to it so he can wear it without losing it in his bag or desk or locker & still be able to reach it as he needs it.
the only thing i don't like is that it isn't a solid enclosure where the strap goes.  
it does slip out easily.  
i put black electrical tape over the gap
so the strap stays in place.
this dress fits like a glove and feels like butter.
"when i tried it on, i immediately bought 2 more."
its modest and pretty.
"for reference, im 5'5"", 130, 34b and got a small."
i'm so happy with this stocking!!!  
it's so pretty and good quality
", the stitching looks so good too!  "
"i would highly recommend a personalized stocking from this seller, they did an awesome job!"
"i'm not using them as a necklace, i would use them to pray.."
this was my purpose to ordered them.. thank you!!
i like the pots very much however
", i do not know what the durability is as of yet"
and i do not understand why you are asking for feedback so soon.  
i have not useed them yet
so i can't be realistic in giving a full and honest review.
i  would think after a month or so of use a more accurate review can be given on the durability of the pots.
don't you think!
ok
but i have better
these clips are great!  
just the right size for holding blocks together while planning placement on my crocheted afghan!  
"strong enough hold to keep things where they need to be, yet easy to open to remove.  "
just have to keep an eye on these when working around other people.  
they tend to disappear into workbaskets other than your own!
"these are great if you have fine hair, which means each strand is thin, not thin hair which is lack of hair."
they are super soft as well!
"and don't expect much fullness from these, just length and having fine hair, adding more length will make your hair look thicker."
"i got this for my son, to use for school."
"the skull arrived on time and came with the case, which is nice, because he doesn't have to shove it in his back pack."
the only problem is that the numbers are smudging off.
they are hand written.
my son doesn't seem to see a problem with it.
we would buy from this seller again.
"sorry, i could not help myself."
product is as advertised.
i was interested in rpg gaming and bought the dice in anticipation of trying out marvel heroic.
got the book and discovered how truly dedicated and imaginative you have to be to play these games.
"however, we are now using the dice for other board games and card games like magic:"
"the gathering, in which these dice have been a major help."
got exactly what we asked for.
"washes great, looks like new."
will order again
i n
the future.
goes with all decor
this looks like the one i have
and it says it's brown
but i see black and gold-print.
either way i love it and it lasted a long time the case being soft makes it last long
and i love it.
the design is faded
so i need a new one..
"i wish the string holding the strap was black, but i guest i'll take it as it is."
it protects my phone and it's fashionable.
"good material, name stitching is pretty quality, will be using long into the future"
i do love this sink.
"i only gave it 4 stars because i don't think it's all that ""opaque""."
"seems pretty solid white to me, it is beautiful though"
and i love it in our newly renovated guest bathroom.
i would definitely buy again.
really cute.
great dress for the price.
i wore it for the first time yesterday during the halloween season.
lots of compliments.
material is slightly stretchy.
nice look and feel.
the original porch light on our 2009 flagstaff pop up broke during a tire blow out.  
doubtful we'd find an exact match
but here it is and everything lined up easily.  
best to put the screws through the lens first(!)
then into back plate.  
and when ordering know this light comes with or without a switch.  
so we're happy.
i got this to help achieve my pre med degree and learn the skull for all of my anatomy classes
i have to take.
"when i got it in the mail, i was super excited with the carrying case and the pipe cleaners."
the pipe cleaners really help with understanding where all the parts in the skull end up through the other side.
"overall, this is a great product for anyone interested in the human skull.  "
i know that this product will help me to get into medical school and become the professional i aspire to be.
it's such a handy tool to be able to reference.
exactly what i needed!
"i originally bought this for work, but then decided to purchase a second one for home."
my computer heats up so bad when i'm watching movies or are running multiple programs and the fan in this cooling pad is pretty efficient at keeping my computer from getting too hot.
the fan is quiet and the entire cooling pad is very light.
i might purchase more and give them as gifts!
"had intended to purchase ceramic vessel sinks and ended up with these and boy, i am glad i did!they are beautiful!!!!  "
"great price, great value, plumber loved them, as well!  "
you can't go wrongwith these sinks!
clearly a lot of care goes into making these straws and they are great for liquids and juices.
they are not large enough for smoothies though.
care should be taken not to drop them too.
"this thing is a rod of glass and you should only let adults use them, they could be hazardous for children."
"the wallet is beautiful and pretty much is as advertised,  however, the slots for credit cards, bank cards are so tight, it is difficult to extract and replace the cards.  "
"i am hoping they will loosen with use, but they haven't yet.  "
"id cards (medicare, ss, my federal employee"
"i'd, had to be trimmed to fit.  "
"also, the screen over my d. l. is somewhat obscuring, but so far, no one has complained"
"2 for one price is great, super fast shipping, sound could be clearer, it's fuzzy...."
"i liked how they are the same size as my old samsung s7 earbuds, but they do not sound as good"
(i use the term loosely).
it's like they use a cheaper speaker - very tinny and high freq's.
sad.
it's exactly what i wanted.  
"it's thin and not bulky, and it's a pretty color"
but you can also see through it
so you can actually still see the phone itself.  
all of the holes in the case line up very well with the  ports and speaker.  
"and, because htc phones are metal, they are slippery and this case gives the grip i need without the bulk.  "
the price was great.  
i love it.
"march 26 2016lovely,and a wonderful find!!!i want to send out a huge ""thank you!!!"
""""
to the perfumer who designed this fabulous sent!!
how unique it makes me feel: fresh and nicely spontainious and most of all  beautiful & confident and most of all
"i feel so sexy when i'm wearing because, i know that i smell absolutely fabulous."
my nephew loves the night blooming cereus so much he purchased one for his girlfriend.
thank god it smells so different on everyone!i
highly recommend this bottle of loveliness who wants to try something made on the island of maui that is priceless & so special
", it makes a perfect gift.again thank you for making this available to purchasealoha and kind regards,sincerely,jules hurst"
bought this for my man's phone.  
was a little skeptical about the built in screen protector but there is no issues with it at all ....
i got mad 1 day and threw it.....
phone was
a-
okay.. not a scratch on it.  
would absolutely buy again....
but it doesn't seem like it's going to break lol
"this sink was for the redo of a small bath, and it's focal point.  "
i placed this sink on a butcher block counter stained walnut.
it created a great focus for a previously blah room that now has an asian feel.  
i love the look.  
the sink was worth the trouble of the online search.
the price and ease of instillation made this do-it-yourself project a lovely bargain.
"delivery was timely, the product excellent."
the colors are bright and it adjusts very easily.
"the buckle is a tad heavy, as expected, so best not to wear with light weight pants...does fine on jean shorts ad as long as it's snug around waste/hips...easiest belt in the world to ""unbuckle""!!"
can't wait to add to my newly begun collection.
the pot and pan were great on a multi-day hunting/hiking trip.
they pack up tightly and are incredibly lightweight.
they come in a little bag that holds them comfortably.
"i placed a small propane tank in the pot, and the pot in the pan, with the lid on the pot."
that all fit in the bag with no problem.
"we were able to cook every food we brought, and it was really easy to clean up."
i love these!
i was so sad when i got back from japan and couldn't find these in the us...
then i found them here.
"they do have a very very fine tip, so if you are looking for a ball point these are not the pens for you."
"however, if you like fine points, or are writing something delicate these are amazing."
"my nephew loves gta, every time i visit he is playing this gameon the computer for hours"
", i got him the gta cheatsmouse pad, he was so excited!"
he said i’m
"“the coolest uncle ever"" ha ha love it!"
highly recommended!
i'm an anatomy and physiology student and this skull worked wonders for my studies!!!
i am so glad that i ordered this.
i even confirmed with my instructor before i purchased it.
totally legit.
just be careful not to get it wet because the numbers will smear.
i wish they were engraved instead of put on with a marker.
other than that this is perfection!
😊
knee pads are perfect for my line of work.
"walking, kneeling, and driving."
i wear them 12 hours a day could not work without them.
i do wear them under my work pants.
and they are not too bulky for me.
the service and the product are 5 stars.
could not be happier.
these check valves arrived on time.  
"they appear to be machined from solid aluminum, not plastic.  "
they have a low resistance to flow
so the one i installed in the fuel line of my 200 hp outboard flowed enough to satisfy the max 20 gpl requirement at full throttle.  
i'd order these again.
"there were many companies selling the same design as this one, but this one was the only one available at the time"
so i decided to go with this one.
i like it a lot!
"fits my cotton pads, cotton swabs, tweezers, and hair ties very neatly."
"it looks nice, stores nicely, and keeps the dust out."
fits nicely in my vanity too.
my only complaint is that it came in with a few scratches.
"other than that, i am satisfied with its functionality, price, and looks."
these pens came on time.
i have ordered so many of these pens till i have lost count
and i know for sure i have tout more on the way.
"theses pens are comfortable to hold, they write nice, they are stylish and they really bling."
i means really.
they come in twos now which is much cheaper.
besides keeping some for myself these pens make great gifts.
i get a lot of calls about them.
try it and trust me you'll love um!
"although i could not hear it whenever used, the person i was talking to complained about noise on the line."
not a good purchase.
waste of money.
i brought 2 and both had the same problem.
"wow, does it blow out some great air and keeps things cool.  "
"the only problem i have with this product is, my 17"" laptop slides easily when setting on this; no grips, but i will probably paste some on myself -- either on the bottom of my laptop or on the metal plate itself."
these are the absolute worst headphones i've ever used.
the free ones you get from planes are higher quality than these.
they look cheap and sound cheap.
good quality.
after 3 years and counting of use not a single issue
the start/pause (volume)
"increase button was not working, but thought it"
’s
ok as the sound was good and comfort and did not initiate return.
just over month
"and both the earphones stopped working, now can not return or replace as it does not show any option."
do not buy this product.
not recommend

the product is unbelievably terribly bad - dead so easily.  
"not worth the money, though a few dollars are not a lot (so expensive when it can only be  used for a few weeks).  "
don't recommend anyone to buy this product.
i took this on the camino and it was perfect to use daily on the balls and heels of my feet.  
the only way i can describe is that it was like putting a 'bra' on my feet.  
several of my friends used it too and raved about how much it helped their hurting feet!
i ordered these on the november 9th.
between the time i have had them and now both earphones do not fully function properly.
with the first pair one earphone had dropped working.
so i decided to try the second.
in the second pair the microphone has never properly worked.
the top was great but the flared bottom was too big for me.
"i'm 5'7"", 143lbs"
and i got a large
", i should have purchased the medium."
"when i ordered these and saw the length of time it was going to take to get here, was a little disappointed as they gave themselves about 20+ days, but wow, they came in within half the time and are working way above expectations!"
best ones to buy instead of the cheaper plastic type!
perfect and worth the wait!
"very nice dress, modest yet flattering."
snug in the chest
but i'm bigger busted
and that's typical for me.
the color is beautiful and it's comfortable as well!
"wish it came in more colors, i'd buy more!"
each year i order a new color.  
all are beautifully made and able to withstand a year of being carried with me wherever i go.  
the maps a blank pages for notes are a handy addition.  
"for those who still enjoy taking pen to paper and tangibly organizing your life, you will be quite happy with your leather-bound planner."
"when the headphones arrived new, they already produced more static than my old samsung headphones of the same design."
the sound would routinely cut out and now only works on one side.

"if you like hidden object games combined with adventure games that have excellent graphics,  good story line, many places to explore, good sound track,and many hints and strategy guide"
"so you can make the game as easy or challenging as you wish, then this game is great."
the price is excellent for a collector copy and it was sent very quickly from uk.
happy with purchase.
i've had this for over a year now and works great
i have a habit of dropping my phone and never had any problems
we love these pj's!
we have multiple pairs.
the quality is way better than carters and other brands sold locally.
we were given a pair of hand me downs and decided to purchase more.
we wash cold and dry on a drying rack like all her other clothes!
we cloth diaper and these fit well.
i can say i absolutely love the product!
it came as is and is the cheapest i found here on amazon.
i love the carrying case it comes with
so i can take it to study anywhere.
it is very helpful if your trying to learn the bones in the skull.
one thing i don't like is the sharpie marker or whatever is used for the numbers comes off easily after handeling it a lot.
i got these as a gift for my friend's birthday and she loves them!  
when elephant trunks are pointing up
it's good luck
so she placed them on her bookshelf right away!  
they have 4 grippers at the bottom of the stand which help to hold the heavier books and the color is perfect!!
i was really impressed by this model.
i am a massage therapist reviewing for another certification
and it's helping me tremendously.
price point is great and the skull is a really nice model.
he also has an amazing smile!
this is excellent ulta thin/slim iphone 6 case.
it was surprisingly much thinner than expected and completely matches the color of my gray iphone 6.
almost looks like there is no cover on my iphone.
"also, the grip of the case feels very comfortable in my hand."
appears to be of excellent quality.
wish
i found this sooner!
"this is a great product, not mentioning the great price."
the front cover just like the apple had with $40.
the handle in back cover even better.
it ergonomically helped for holding ipad which i had recently left arm pain.
that is not what i expected.
highly recommend this product.
love it!
we kinda of go thru these probes a couple times a year because the hubs forgets to watch where the cord is and burns the snot out of the cord
but we love that that we can get a replacement and our original unit
is still working great!
always nice to know your meat is safe to eat!
great sink if your looking for a vessel sink this one is it.
the price is unbelievable when i ordered it was not sure what to expect being in the plumbing business.
its just like the description says 5/8 thick heavy duty opaque white.
works good.
"seem a little loose, but could just be the screws"
i ordered two of these for use with my model railroading digital command control (dcc) system.  
i needed one to go from a digitrax pr3 connected to my computer to the command station.  
both cables checked out good with the lt1 tester
and i was up and running in no time.  
sure beats hunting around the big box stores and specialty shops for a 6p6c data cable and saved me the hassle of making me one myself!  
"used as a loconet cable, note that the color of the wiring is blue, orange, green, brown, red, black as opposed to white, black, red, green, yellow, blue.  "
"that's not a fault of the cable, just something to keep in mind to avoid confusion if mixing with ""real branded"" loconet cables."
the clips on the end fit snug and seem as though they will last until they are abused.  
the only thing that i can see would make this better is if they had protective boots like you often see on ethernet patch cables.  
"without taking one apart, i can't tell for certain, but they feel very flexible leading me to believe the wires are indeed stranded wiring.  "
markings on the casing read awm 20251 60c 150v
vw-1.  
uncertain of the gauge.
these are great little pots...
i bundle them with a wood burning stove like this one... 
outdoor wood
burning camp stove
fameley backpacking camping picnic lightweight stainless stove for tent hiking backpack(sliver) 
i have this combo in each of my rigs....and have a couple ready to give as christmas presents.
"i would highly recommend this cook kit, it's not for the ultra light gram weenie crowd, but i sure do like them...."
these were very useful for my last trip.  
"i like that they are somewhat flexible, but"
"the only thing i was a little disappointed about was that there was almost no structure to them, so it was a little more time consuming to pack certain items in them.  "
"aside from that, a great product"
great sound
purchased for daughter.
so far the case has held up and good quality.
no complaints.
took a very long time to find a case with a front cover to protect the screen.
used in addition to a matte screen protector.
fast shipping and the skull was packaged very well.
i love that the vault has magnets
"so it secures the top part of the skull to the base of the skull, never seen that before so it was cool!"
i also appreciate your friendly email
it was very sweet.
so i'll just copy and paste the review.
"i ordered the black pair twice, because one earring was lost in tall grass."
the earrings were in little plastic wrappings inside a cute blue satin drawstring pouch.
they're a nice size and weight.
"not too heavy, but you can tell they're there."
this is the most amazing cellphone holder for car ever.
"i have tried so many products before i found this product,and i have been using it for 15 months."
it still holds.
gosh i love quality stuff.
"this is a nice acrylic container that holds cotton squares, qtips and eye-moistening towelettes, all in one place, so i don't have multiple containers on the counter."
amazing price for getting two earbuds!!
"the sound quality is amazing, the buds stay in my ear, and the remote control works great!"
nothing bad to say about them.
"i'd recently gotten into bullet journaling, and washi tape is an easy way to decorate borders and titles."
this is a good array of nature based designs.
pros:
"small, colorful, easy to use."
pretty packaging.
good for writing on.
cons: slightly translucent.
"if you have marked guides, male sure to erase them before laying down the tape."
"quick shipping, received as promised"
bought this for a friend.
"tested it out to make sure it works,  so far so good."
neat easy to hold.
will update if any issues arise.
"lovely pattern, fabric that doesn't wrinkle easily, and fits well."
this is a nice summer dress that i've used for work.
received compliments the first time i wore it.
1 set was used as in ear wax & all!
both sets did not work!
thank god for good customer support!
very well made costume!
my 15-month old wore this for halloween
and we got so many compliments.
the costume is adorable and very durable!
no loose threads or strings like other mass produced commercial costumes.
my only regret is she can't wear it every day!
mic doesn't work
the case was exactly as described.
perfect fit for the bose bluetooth speaker.
wish it had a shoulder strap in addition to the carrying handle.
didn’t break the bank.
this is not a porcelain white sink....
this is glass!  
it is beautiful.  
has a lighter look and much more up to date.  
love it!
"looks great, feels great just as described by the seller..."
this case is awesome!
makes it so much easier to transport my mini console to and from friends houses on long gaming nights.
very nice and figure flattering.
"it's a bit longer than i thought but very comfy with lots of give, may want to order down a size"
why does amazon insist on selling knock offs.
wasn't expecting much for the price but these have failed to meet even low expectations.
don't waste your money.
wonderful washi tapes for my card making projects!
"this light was an exact replacement on my forest river - flagstaff camper, even the holes for the mounting screws are in the right place.  "
this model has the switch at about the same price as one without a switch; make sure you get the one you want.
this looks great on my counter in the bathroom and holds a lot of cotton balls and qtips.  
it is so much nicer than having to root around in the drawer for one every time you need it.  
guests have even commented on how nice it looks.
these are great.  
i can't tell the difference between these and the brand name clips.  
i use them all the time when quilting and have not have had any breakage.
great product and customer service.
i will order more from these guys.
i got the knuckles fast and they look pretty good.
they work as expected and haven't left me carrying the truck down the trail to a repair.
"a simple sundress that fits good, feels good and looks good!"
i haven't washed it yet but tried it on and am pleasantly surprised how well it fit.
this is a gorgeous sink.
i was concerned about buying based only on the picture but this sink exceeded my expectations.
that's very rare.
clears up your complexion in a week.  
no new outbreaks yet after a month of use.  
no downside (except maybe but the price)
but worth the cost.
these are great and a lot of fun to wear.
i work with special needs kids and have worn these to make some of my kids laugh during an event they might not otherwise participate in.
this dress is super cute and flattering.
i get compliments on it every time i wear it.
it is perfect for that transition from summer to fall.
looks cute with sandals and a statement necklace or booties and a jacket.
i love this little dress.
it fits well and is very flattering.
a great summer sundress.
i love this case!!
it protects my phone by having a case around it at home and is perfect with the magnet to attach and go!!
no more folding over to talk or try to hold open to take pics!!
easy on easy off!!
good
bought them because it was a good deal and the pastels look good on my hulking large frame.
seriously the absorb more sweat than my name brand ones do
and i don't mind the pastel colors.
want a slim look?
i wear this adorable top with white capris or jeans.  
every time i do people asked me if i've lost weight! lol
i'm loving this... store all the wires together in one spot!
thank you
great value!
it's been going strong for over 6 months with hardly any wear.
i was hesitant about the quality because the price was so low
but i am so happy i ordered this!
purchased for an 8 week a/p class.
my only regret was not ordering it sooner.
it was a great investment.
i just didn't order it in time for proper perpetration of my class.
i had 7 days for the exam i ordered it and received as promise in two days
i just should've ordered way sooner.
"again, great investment!"
knife was of a good quality.
initially had an issue with the lights but dealer corrected that issue immediately.
blade and quality was very good.
color was as pictured.
communication with dealer was among the best i have had.
dealer was assisting and responding to any questions immediately.
i like this bag more every day.
"it fits my laptop perfectly (without a sleeve) along with paper files for work, and it seems like it will hold up to the weight of carrying all that."
shoulder strap doesn't cut into my shoulder with all that in it.
the color is a lovely reddish-brown.
stitching looks good.
straps are adjustable length.
this case is great.
does not lift up the edges from the screen protector like other silicone cases do.
great summer dress.  
doesn't wrinkle in a suitcase so good for travel.
"this is a very cute, heavy duty waterproof changing pad.  "
i love the different languages on it.  
"it is a good size that you can take on the go or use at home in a crib, cradle, bassinette, or changing table."
it was too small.  
i should have selected a larger size.
i don't want to give it less than 5 starts because it's my fault
it didn't fit.
cute.  
long enough to cover your assets when wearing leggings.  
"nice thin material, but not see through.  "
"i ordered a large 5'2"" 140 lbs.  "
have a bit of room.  
got the green army color so in right now!
purchased this for my boyfriend and he loves it.
it looks great on him!
it's the perfect size-
"not too big, not too small."
arrived amazingly fast.
love this purse.
it's perfect.
it holds its shape but not to stiff like other leather purses.
color is beautiful.
lots of compliments!!
great product...
great price...scratch that - awesome price...and prompt shipping of what i ordered.
"as a clinician, medical educator, and researcher, having quality teaching tools at my fingertips is essential."
thanks geekidoc!
"this is a great choice for someone who wants more than the standard ""one die of each type"" and that's it."
"there's no fancy color scheme, however, you can't be the price for the selection."
the numbers are clearly marked and easily legible.
i would definitely recommend them.
great fit!  
the skirt is so soft and when washed
doesn't shrink.  
i've placed in dryer
and i've hung dry
", i prefer to hang dry in order to hold it's shape.  "
"like so much, i have purchased 2 more."
these pots are not too easy to clean.
"for $10, though, it's a nice little kit.  "
"haven't used for anything too fancy just yet, but so far it's held up to 3 camping trips well ."
nice little cinch sack it goes in.
holding my s7 was a bit like holding a wet bar of soap.
i just got my tank armor case and wrapped it around my phone.
"so far, it seems great."
one problem....
it is damn near impossible to pull down the top menu.
which is a bit frustrating.
"aside from that, i like it."
loved this two compartment cotton ball and cotton pads holder.  
it fits nicely on my vanity for organization.  
keeps the cotton clean and handy ready for use.  
clear container to know when to refill.
don't stick this directly on your phone.
the stickiness is so great that you won't be able to get it off.
stick it directly on your cell phone case
don't stick this directly on your phone.
the stickiness is so great that you won't be able to get it off.

very good product.
my wife loves it.
we added a glass screen protector and now have full protection.
easy to hold and not too bulky.
perfect fit and very easy to install as a replacement for our broken one.  
we had no experience with rv repairs and were pleasantly surprised at how easy this was to put in.  
the price was a fraction of what it would have been from the tv dealer and then having them install.
it is very pretty just like the photos.
very strong magnets hold phone into wallet.
i just received it
so i have not used it for very long.
so far so good.
good for minor drops.
i have dropped my phone on the sidewalk a few times and the case worked well.
would buy again.
"i would have gone five stars, but i can only use one conveniently, since one knee is smaller and the pad slides down (polio).  "
i use the left one as both a brace and a pad for when i kneel down.  
"retired guy who is active, but has arthritis issues.  "
"if there is a smaller size, i'll get one for my right leg.  "
jg
very good make of shoes.
my 10 year old tears shoes up
and they last him through all his adventures
"first use right out of the package, and the sound quality was horrible and there was so much static noise."
"very cheaply made, but i guess you get what you pay for."
broke 1 already.
what a waste.
daughter love decorating her school note books with it.
good quality and easy to work with
"nice bag, fits perfectly, fully recommended !"
bought as a gift.
took these on a 10 day car camping trip.  
these were fabulous.  
small and lightweight.  
cleaned up well.  
packed up well.
highly recommend.
"got this originally for myself, it wasn't flattering on me"
i gifted it to a friend
it looks awesome on her fits
perfectly looks just like the picture.
ended up getting two more for her.
much of the cable is lower end plastic and has a cheap feel to it but that being said it seems to be pretty solid and does what i was looking for.
for the cost of the product and what i expected i will give it 4 stars.
love it.
great value for the price.
looks great with my decor.
"simple, yet pretty."
fits great and looks great.
good price too.
i gave them a 5 star because they are very nice.
but i haven't had any type of earring hanging from my ear in such of a long time it feels strange.
definitely heavier but doesn't scratch or knick up if you work with your hands.  
i didn't see a reason to spend a lot on my wedding ring.
"this is soft, light, float and fit as expected.  "
perfect summer dress that got a lot of complements.
i love this geekidoc skull.
it's really helping me learn everything i need to know.
i'm pursuing a nursing career this is a wonderful fine especially for the price!!!
"sometimes it is a trick to get the charger cord in, if i do not use my readers."
totally in love with this jumpersuit.
this was my birthday outfit.
it runs big
i’m
5’6 190lbs
and i ordered a medium.
it fit great!
i ordered a medium per reviews saying it's small.
i'm 120 lbs and a 32
"b. its very comfortable, but i do double up to go for a run."
i think a small might be better for running.
good game
i love this bag!
i bought it for the security but the ease of use had me come back and order a second one.
i am a massage ce presenter and have my own practice.  
this is going to be very helpful to show the structures and cranial sutures!
i got it as gift.
love it but have no use for it.
i have much better gaming mouse pads.
keep it as sentimental value.
great and only $10.
same of the other one's twice the price.
"is very light also, nice size."
much better than cooking out of a cup.
worth it.
"perfect, as shown in the photos"
these clips are exactly the same as the overpriced clover clips.
they work perfectly and what a great deal!
loved playing it
even better than expected
these stockings are great.
they are very well made
and i have no doubt they will last for many christmases to come.
only problem is the dings in my kitchen table.  
great quality love these bad boys
it fits in in a white room at the foot of my red king bed.
it would look good in front of the kitchen sink also.
i am a fan of abstract art and this rug is a keeper.
well worth the money.
paid more than i wish i had
but its just what i needed for insulation in the house on a cold wall and heat reflector.
love this bag!
it came packaged really well to protect the leather.  
it fits my 13 in laptop well.  
can be dressed up or down.
this t-shirt was better than i expected.  
"the graphics were fabulous, the colors vivid and the t-shirt material nice quality.  "
a definite win for gifting.
and the best part for me was it came in a size 3x.
"nice quality, came in a timely manner but just a bit shorter than i had wanted.  "
i'm wearing it though and enjoying the soft fabric.
"nice quality, came in a timely manner but just a bit shorter than i had wanted.  "

great color for fall.
"my parents are traveling to hawaii, and i wanted to buy them some authentic shirts to wear when they go.  "
"these were beautiful shirts, but unfortunately my father is bigger than i had thought.  "

hilo bay was fantastic about the return.

i was so happy to try them.
i would recommend them to anyone.
"great quality, pretty and they also come with velvet bags."
thanks
great product.
great shipping package.
seller recommended .
worth it.
the leather is soft but seems durable.
the gusset is large enough that the cards are easy to remove or slide in.
the rf is a great addition.
really cute.
these items were used in kids activity bags for a wedding.
they were a hit.
this  
hidden object game is one of those games
were

allthe little children
who are trapped in some cemetary  
but  will you make it
in timei guess

not very effective.
"i bought a larger size expecting it to be a little small, so it fit great!"
love it
"a great alternative to having to replace your entire fuel pump assembly because the cheap gm check valve went out, or on an old carburetor vehicle."
both stopped working within a couple of days of use.
dont bother with these
my fairly new toshiba touch screen laptop was giving a warning message about overheating.
this gadget stops that.
it is quiet and fits under the laptop comfortably.
i really like these boots.
this is my second pair.
i bought a brown one first
and now i bought a black one.
my favorite boots!
awesome
very comfortable!
great little luggage tags for my kids bags.
one of the tags broke while traveling.
"nonetheless, they are cute!"
a nice light summer dress.
"fits nice, feels nice."
"great for keeping crib, rock and play, playpen and toddler bed."
i wash in gentle cycle for cleaning.
a must.
for the price it is ok.  
the fit and finish could be tighter and smoother
but otherwise i like it.
"looks great, like polished milky glass."
"we like how this is set up, much easier than having cords everywhere."
i had to wait a 9 days to get these.
were they worth the wait?
absolutely worth the wait!
amazing sound and quaility!
definitely worth the price as well.
fits perfectly !
i love the blue.
"it's not to overwhelmingly blue like it appears in the photo , smooth and feels great in my hands,  plus it keeps the phone thin and sleek looking !"
a great buy for $4.99 glad
i didn't purchase the one from verizon for $35.99..
"can't comment yet on how it protects,  but when i drop my phone, i will be sure to revise."
love it !
"product was as described, and fits perfectly."

i've read the reviews for this wallet and i will have to agree with all of them what a beautiful wallet!
lots of room!
very happy with this purchase.

i wore them all day in extreme cold and my feet stayed warm.  
"the shoes were very comfortable, i even stepped in a couple of snow puddles and my feet stayed dry."
great product.
reasonable price.
what more is there to say.
you get what you pay for.
i can't use certain chargers because the case it too bulky
but it protects my phone just fine.
i bought these for my husband for christmas.
he is a huge arsenal fan.
he is always wearing them on game day.
he says that they are comfortable.
"beautiful leather, i have had it for awhile and no problems with it.  "
it has may sections in it which are great.  
not bulky at all.
one pair of headphones dies within a month and the other is dying as i type this.  
do not buy!!!
"works as expected, the only problem is you cannot have the case on while using the stylis because it causes it to skip"
very nice looking holder.
i think i will order another one for the guest bathroom.
"ok, good quality"
but i needed color coded to match loconet wiring scheme.
it works fine.
helped me study for a&p at home.
little thin but very pretty.
will purchase again.
this case works well on my lg phone.  
it makes it a little larger to handle which is good because the phone is fairly small.
my niece loved the mug so much!!!
great product i get hot and horny when i use it
"i just received my order today, and i have to say product looks exactly how it's described!"
"it also works very well, fan runs really quiet and keeps my laptop cool"
these ear buds fall right out of your ear after about 10 minutes.
had to buy another (different) pair.
"bought this for my new phone, phone sucks but the case is pure genius."
no problems at all with this one
and it is 2 for casing!
i ended up sizing up with this dress
but it is soft and very flowy/comfortable.
love the pockets!
fits nicely.
"these items arrived too late to use them on the parade float that i ordered them for, but they appear to to solid, well made rings."

size is perfect for daily use and
the anti-theft is great.
this wallet looks even better than it does in the picture.
its the perfect size and
i can fit all my cards and passport into this wallet.
the color is great and the leather is good quality.
i can't believe i only paid $15 for this.
the speaker fits perfectly.  
the look and feel is high quality.

pretty light and durable.
the handles are solid and don't feel flimsy.
perfect size for a camp stove.
awesome for school dice games.
kids love it and very easy to understand.
nice color coding for sets
so i can easily keep track of all the pieces
i love these cute little finger puppets!
they are well designed and well made - great value for the price!
"they are in easter eggs now, awaiting the egg hunt tomorrow."
much better than filling the eggs with a bunch of candy.

will play it again!

a lot of the skills i've seen have missing holes and things.
perfect
magnet is strong!  
case is so pretty!  
"glitter falls off a little at a time (it's glitter, non mini gems in the picture)."
these earphones were terrible.
created a whole lot of static during phone calls.
sent them back.
love this top!
nice and flowy!
fits redcat everest 10 but my bearings was to small so i will try some for a axial scx10 seems to be a good product for the price

my almost 3 years old daughter fell in love with them right away!!
perfect

good dress.
for me too short.
love the color and the bling....
also has a nice grip to it.  
liked it
so well i ordered a pink one too
just the extension i needed for using my phone at the gym.
"prevents the connector from disconnecting while in pocket, no loss in audio quality."
the head phones straight up stopped playing sound after 3 weeks of regular use.
cheap garbage product dont buy
this fits nicely under my laptop and keeps me from getting too warm.  
it runs quietly.
very good & fast service.
"cute, comfy and easy care"
works as a remote cable for my yaesu ft-8900r.
nice cover
100% satisfaction in terms of being non-slip and cool-looking.
mine is the clear color which is the best as it shows off the nice champagne color of this phone.
ours recently wouldn't work on our travel trailer/camper.  
can't believe we found the exact thing we needed on amazon!  
and so inexpensive!
excellent quality
we used this product in august when we camped in washington.
very well made and works like a charm.
sturdy case.
"over all, good deal."
only down side is difficulty getting to the back button  & recent apps button
( case is in the way)
perfect !!!
fits everything so nice!

well made and cute.
it's a durable case.
i got this for my mom
she likes the handle too.
it's a beautifully made dress.

a smart looking bag.  
everything fit snugly
but i wish it were slightly larger.
good for airplane entertainment.
the color pink is beautiful.  
the magnetic part is what sold itself.
a very good fidget!
very happy.
"i think the quality is good, they're visually appealing."
the medium and large differ in size immensely
", i wouldn't recommend using this as a training kit alone."
"get another toy, or two, for in between those two sizes."
slow and steady wins the race!
i would recommend this product to friend's seeking a product like this.
these leggings are phenomenal.
"i purchased a medium for a weekend football game in maroon, received them early in the week"
"but they were overall big on me, so"
i ordered a small which i received two days later (in plenty of time for the game).
they compare to the lulus i pay just under $100 for!
definitely plan on getting another pair once i return the mediums.
beautiful bag.
exactly what i wanted.
i really like this product
same as samsung earphones.....
excellent product.  
stock bearings were just a fraction too small but works without issue..
this controller is beautiful in person but it does have a paint smell to it if you smell the control and while you hold it the smell can get to your hands but
overall its an amazing controller
i reccomend it to anyone who doesn't mind a little paint smell
these are a little smaller than i was expecting .i
bought them for my daughter to use one a trip this summer .i may have to order another set .they
are very shallow.
"good for rolled clothing,probably not so good for folded."
we love to take baths with this wrap!
it is warm and cute.
"not a terry, more like fleece, but that's ok."
"yeah, these didn't even last me a week."
sound is fine but really not worth buying if they can't last a month
nice wallet--fits a lot of cards.  
wish
this came in black  
haven't had a chance yet to test out the rfid blocking so can only give this 4 stars right now.
very cute and comfortable shoes.

allow you to keep your hands warm and still use your fingers for the phone and other projects

and it fits great.
received items timely and they worked great!  
a+
cute and classy

love hogs like you wouldn't believe.
this is a good one.
these headphones didn't even last a month.
both pairs of headphones suck.
so far they hold up really well!  
as described!
"hey guys, i play gta v practically every day"
and when i stumbled into this product i decided i had to purchase it.
i'm glad i did.
the best thing about the pad is that the cheats are literally right in front of my eyes constantly.
what a genius idea.
"the pad is very comfortable, round shape and awesome design."

she was thrilled!

i used this to study for my anatomy and physiology exam and got a perfect score with extra credit.
more things were labeled than i needed which was very convenient.
definitely worth the buy!
nice
sweet case.
"fits perfectly, buttons work fine."
protects phone
well.
highly recommend.
very cheap but didn't look or feel cheap.
i was worried these wouldn't go on straight
but they fit very well.
i am on the heavier side of average and these fit me well.
"to be fair, i have only worn them once."
"if i have problems, i will comment and amend my review."
at this point though i like them so much i may buy them in other designs as well.
it was a gift for a friend
and she absolutely loved it.

is very comfortable when inserted and can be worn all day.
my wife loves the look of it inserted in my bottom.
we recently purchased a cb6000 and it turns my wife on to have me caged and plugged.

easy to clean.
love mine!
fits perfectly to my new lg k10.
not to bulky.
is what i was looking for.
good product
bought these for my friends christmas gifts and they absolutely love them!
this case met my expectations and is nice.
the only thing that could be better is if the sides of the case were not so close to the keyboard
it causes me not to be able to hit the letter a q or numbers keys well
both pairs broke within 2 months.
very poor durability.
would not recommend.
bought this for my mom.
she loves it and it fits perfectly on her lg.
color is even nicer in person.  
these are cute and cheap and they do the job as intended.  
good purchase.
we bought these in purple/pink/orange for our kids.  
love love love them!!
"the traditional freetime case for kids is nice and protects well enough, but these have a handle which also can be used as a stand!  "
my kids are between the ages of 2 and 6 and being able to grasp a handle and walk with their tablets is huge!  
the only case that had a slight variation on the color is this purple one.  
it is darker than pictured on my computer screen.  
we would definitely purchase it again!
"bought a single one that works great, so i bought five more for future use."
i bought it for a gift.
it's very nice.
i wish i had bought one for myself.

the quality of the had is great.
my daughter loved it.
fits and works as described.
i was looking for the ability to rotate the screen and this fit the bill.
"economical, attractive and delvered on time."
"this product was great, we cut around the sticker and then kept the backing on it"
so we could hang it with the tape we were required to use and then removed it easily.  
we can still hang the sticker somewhere
and i'm sure it will be used as a decoration again!
great iphone cover!
clean and simple - just as i wanted.
easy to put on and off my phone.
it's much more scratch/damage resistant than my previous clear cover i had (from elsewhere).
i recommend this product.

"it worked great, but i wanted something with a built in stand."

it's just as durable (i even dropped the kindle a few times to check before giving to my 4-year-old.)
the stand works great.
if my 4-year-old can't hurt her kindle in the case then no one can ;)

big hit for my granddaughter.
suggested and bought for my daughter-in-law for my granddaughter  who acts just like her daddy when he was her age and was very rough on things.
the tablet is still surviving and has been dropped but has not broke.
we also put the shatter proof shield on the glass as an added precaution and both are working great together.
granddaughter threw down wood stairs
and it survived intact.
just as described.
